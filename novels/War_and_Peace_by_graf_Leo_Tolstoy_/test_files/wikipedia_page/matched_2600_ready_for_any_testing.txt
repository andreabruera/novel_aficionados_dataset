war and peace pre reform russian война миръ post reform russian война мир romanized vojna mir is novel by the russian author leo tolstoy
the novel chronicles the history of the french invasion of russia and the impact of the napoleonic era on tsarist society through the stories of five russian aristocratic family
it is regarded as central work of world literature and one of tolstoy finest literary achievements portions of an earlier version titled the year were serialized in the russian messenger from to
the novel was first published in its entirety in tolstoy said war and peace is not novel even less is it poem and still less historical chronicle
tolstoy also said that the best russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call war and peace novel
large sections especially the later chapters are philosophical discussion rather than narrative instead he regarded anna_pavlovna_scherer karenina as his first true novel
the encyclopædia britannica states it can be argued that no single english novel attains the universality of the russian writer leo tolstoy war and peace

tolstoy notes from the ninth draft of war and peace tolstoy began writing war and peace in the year that he finally married and settled down at his country estate
the first half of the book was written under the name during the writing of the second half he read widely and acknowledged schopenhauer as one of his main inspirations
tolstoy wrote in letter to afanasy fet that what he has written in war and peace is also said by schopenhauer in the world as will and representation
in the periodical russkiy vestnik the russian messenger published the first part of this draft under the title and published more the following year
tolstoy was dissatisfied with this version although he allowed several parts of it to be published with different ending in
however tolstoy approaches it from the other side the first draft of the novel was completed in he heavily rewrote the entire novel between and
the version that was published in russkiy vestnik had very different ending from the version eventually published under the title war and peace in
tolstoy wife sophia tolstaya copied as many as seven separate complete manuscripts before tolstoy considered it again ready for publication russians who had read the serialized version were eager to buy the complete novel and it sold out almost immediately
the novel was translated almost immediately after publication into many other languages it is unknown why tolstoy changed the name to war and peace
he may have borrowed the title from the work of monsieur_pierre joseph_alexeevich proudhon la guerre et la paix the war and the peace in french
the title may also be another reference to titus described as being master of war and peace in the twelve caesars written by suetonius in
the manuscript was re edited and annotated in russia in and since has been translated into english german french spanish dutch swedish finnish albanian korean and czech
the completed novel was then called voyna mir война мир in new style orthography in english war and peace tolstoy was instrumental in bringing new kind of consciousness to the novel
his narrative structure is noted for its god like ability to hover over and within events but also in the way it swiftly and seamlessly portrayed particular character point of view
his use of visual detail is often cinematic in scope using the literary equivalents of panning wide shots and close ups
these devices while not exclusive to tolstoy are part of the new style of the novel that arose in the mid century and of which tolstoy proved himself master
the standard russian text of war and peace is divided into four books comprising fifteen parts and an epilogue in two parts
roughly the first half is concerned strictly with the fictional characters whereas the latter parts as well as the second part of the epilogue increasingly consist of essays about the nature of war power history and historiography
certain abridged versions remove these essays entirely while others published even during tolstoy life simply moved these essays into an appendix
the novel is set years before tolstoy day but he had spoken with people who lived through the french invasion of russia
he read all the standard histories available in russian and french about the napoleonic wars and had read letters journals autobiographies and biographies of napoleon_bonaparte and other key players of that era
tolstoy interspersed these essays into the story in way that defies previous fictional convention there are approximately real persons named or referred to in war and peace
he worked from primary source materials interviews and other documents as well as from history books philosophy texts and other historical novels
tolstoy also used great deal of his own experience in the crimean war to bring vivid detail and first hand accounts of how the imperial russian army was structured
tolstoy was critical of standard history especially military history in war and peace he explains at the start of the novel third volume his own views on how history ought to be written
his aim was to blur the line between fiction and history to get closer to the truth as he states in volume ii
cover of war and peace italian translation although the book is mainly in russian significant portions of dialogue are in french
it has been suggested that the use of french is deliberate literary device to portray artifice while russian emerges as language of sincerity honesty and seriousness
it could however also simply represent another element of the realistic style in which the book is written since french was the common language of the russian aristocracy at the time
in fact the russian nobility often knew only enough russian to command their servants tolstoy illustrates this by showing that julie_drubetskaya karagina character in the novel is so unfamiliar with her country native tongue that she has to take russian lessons
it is suggested that this is to demonstrate russia freeing itself from foreign cultural domination and to show that once friendly nation has turned into an enemy
the use of french diminishes as the book progresses by midway through the book several of the russian aristocracy are eager to find russian tutors for themselves
in by the russian artist illarion pryanishnikov the novel spans the period to the era of catherine_petrovna the great was still fresh in the minds of older people
for the next one hundred years it became social requirement for members of the russian nobility to speak french and understand french culture
catherine_petrovna had made french the language of her royal court this historical and cultural context in the aristocracy is reflected in war and peace
catherine_petrovna grandson alexander_the_great i came to the throne in at the age of in the novel his mother marya_dmitrievna_akhrosimova feodorovna is the most powerful woman in the russian court

the century great man theory claims that historical events are the result of the actions of heroes and other great individuals tolstoy argues that this is impossible because of how rarely these actions result in great historical events
rather he argues great historical events are the result of many smaller events driven by the thousands of individuals involved he compares this to calculus and the sum of infinitesimals
he then goes on to argue that these smaller events are the result of an inverse relationship between necessity and free will necessity being based on reason and therefore explainable by historical analysis and free will being based on consciousness and therefore inherently unpredictable
the novel that made its author the true lion of the russian literature according to ivan goncharov enjoyed great success with the reading public upon its publication and spawned dozens of reviews and analytical essays some of which by dmitry pisarev pavel annenkov dragomirov and strakhov formed the basis for the research of later tolstoy scholars
leonid pasternak illustration to war and peace yet the russian press initial response to the novel was muted most critics unable to decide how to classify it
the liberal newspaper golos the voice april was one of the first to react its anonymous reviewer posed question later repeated by many others
what could this possibly be what kind of genre are we supposed to file it to where is fiction in it and where is real history
writer and critic nikolai akhsharumov writing in vsemirny trud suggested that war and peace was neither chronicle nor historical novel but genre merger this ambiguity never undermining its immense value
the cultural history of one large section of our society the political and social panorama of it in the beginning of the current century was his suggestion
it is the epic the history novel and the vast picture of the whole nation life wrote ivan turgenev in his bid to define war and peace in the foreword for his french translation of the two hussars published in paris by le temps in
annenkov who praised the novel too was equally vague when trying to classify it in general the literary left received the novel coldly
they saw its major fault as the author inability to portray new kind of revolutionary intelligentsia in his novel as critic varfolomey zaytsev put it
and shelgunov in delo magazine characterized the novel as lacking realism showing its characters as cruel and rough mentally stoned morally depraved and promoting the philosophy of stagnation
still mikhail saltykov schedrin who never expressed his opinion of the novel publicly in private conversation was reported to have expressed delight with how strongly this count_bennigsen has stung our higher society
dmitry pisarev in his unfinished article russian gentry of old staroye barstvo otechestvennye zapiski while praising tolstoy realism in portraying members of high society was still unhappy with the way the author as he saw it idealized the old nobility expressing unconscious and quite natural tenderness towards the russian dvoryanstvo
on the opposite front the conservative press and patriotic authors a norov and a vyazemsky among them were accusing tolstoy of consciously distorting history desecrating the patriotic feelings of our fathers and ridiculing dvoryanstvo
they saw it as devoid of social critique and keen on the idea of national unity one of the first comprehensive articles on the novel was that of pavel annenkov published in issue of vestnik evropy
the critic praised tolstoy masterful portrayal of man at war marveled at the complexity of the whole composition organically merging historical facts and fiction
the dazzling side of the novel according to annenkov was the natural simplicity with which transports the worldly affairs and big social events down to the level of character who witnesses them
annekov thought the historical gallery of the novel was incomplete with the two great raznotchintsys speransky and count_arakcheev and deplored the fact that the author stopped at introducing to the novel this relatively rough but original element
in the end the critic called the novel the whole epoch in the russian fiction slavophiles declared tolstoy their bogatyr and pronounced war and peace the bible of the new national idea
war and peace is the work of genius equal to everything that the russian literature has produced before he pronounced in the first smaller essay
it is now quite clear that from when the war and peace was published the very essence of what we call russian literature has become quite different acquired the new form and meaning the critic continued later
strakhov was the first critic in russia who declared tolstoy novel to be masterpiece of level previously unknown in russian literature
still being true slavophile he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major slavophiliac ideas of meek russian character supremacy over the rapacious european kind using apollon grigoriev formula
years later in discussing strakhov own book the world as whole tolstoy criticized both grigoriev concept of russian meekness vs western bestiality and strakhov interpretation of it
several articles on war and peace were published in in zarya magazine by nikolai strakhov among the reviewers were military man and authors specializing in the war literature
n lachinov member of the russky invalid newspaper staff april called the battle of schöngrabern scenes bearing the highest degree of historical and artistic truthfulness and totally agreed with the author view on the battle of borodino which some of his opponents disputed
the army general and respected military writer mikhail dragomirov in an article published in oruzheiny sbornik the military almanac while disputing some of tolstoy ideas concerning the spontaneity of wars and the role of commander in battles advised all the russian army officer to use war and peace as their desk book describing its battle scenes as incomparable and serving for an ideal manual to every textbook on theory of military art
most assessed highly the artfulness and realism of tolstoy battle scenes unlike professional literary critics most prominent russian writers of the time supported the novel wholeheartedly
goncharov turgenev leskov dostoyevsky and fet have all gone on record as declaring war and peace the masterpiece of the russian literature
ivan goncharov in july letter to pyotr ganzen advised him to choose for translating into danish war and peace adding this is positively what might be called russian iliad
embracing the whole epoch it is the grandiose literary event showcasing the gallery of great man painted by lively brush of the great master
in unhappy with ganzen having chosen anna_pavlovna_scherer karenina to start with goncharov insisted war and peace is the extraordinary poem of novel both in content and execution
this is one of the most if not the most profound literary work ever it also serves as monument to russian history glorious epoch when whatever figure you take is colossus statue in bronze
in expressing satisfaction with the fact that tolstoy works have now been translated into danish goncharov again stressed the immense importance of war and peace
even minor characters carry all the characteristic features of the russian people and its life count_bennigsen tolstoy really mounts over everybody else here he remarked
fyodor dostoyevsky in may letter to strakhov described war and peace as the last word of the landlord literature and the brilliant one at that
in draft version of the raw youth he described tolstoy as a historiograph of the dvoryanstvo or rather its cultural elite
the objectivity and realism impart wonderful charm to all scenes and alongside people of talent honour and duty he exposes numerous scoundrels worthless goons and fools he added
not only of the poetic side of his art but also the reality he deals with in its historical as well as contemporary context
in dostoyevsky wrote my strong conviction is that writer of fiction has to have most profound knowledge here as far as see it only one writer excels in this count_bennigsen lev tolstoy
nikolai leskov then an anonymous reviewer in birzhevy vestnik the stock exchange herald wrote several articles praising highly war and peace calling it the best ever russian historical novel and the pride of the contemporary literature
marveling at the realism and factual truthfulness of tolstoy book leskov thought the author deserved the special credit for having lifted up the people spirit upon the high pedestal it deserved
while working most elaborately upon individual characters the author apparently has been studying most diligently the character of the nation as whole the life of people whose moral strength came to be concentrated in the army that came up to fight mighty napoleon_bonaparte
in this respect the novel of count_bennigsen tolstoy could be seen as an epic of the great national war which up until now has had its historians but never had its singers leskov wrote
you ve managed to show us in great detail the other mundane side of life and explain how organically does it feed the outer heroic side of it he added
ivan turgenev gradually re considered his initial skepticism as to the novel historical aspect and also the style of tolstoy psychological analysis
in his article written in the form of letter addressed to edmond abou the editor of the french newspaper le xixe siècle turgenev described tolstoy as the most popular russian writer and war and peace as one of the most remarkable books of our age
this vast work has the spirit of an epic where the life of russia of the beginning of our century in general and in details has been recreated by the hand of true master
afanasy fet in january letter to tolstoy expressed his great delight with the novel the manner in which count_bennigsen tolstoy conducts his treatise is innovative and original
this is the great work of great writer and in it there true real russia turgenev wrote it was largely due to turgenev effort that the novel started to gain popularity with the european readership
