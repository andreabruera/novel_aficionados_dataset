<p/>Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this.
<p/>One day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was two years old she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was playing in a garden, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) plucked another flower and ran with it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother.
<p/>I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) heart and cried, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Darling</b></font>)</div>This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) must grow up. You always know after you are two.
<p/>Of course they lived at 14 -LSB-their house number on their street-RSB-, and until Wendy came her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother was the chief one.
<p/>Two is the beginning of the end. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.
<p/>The way Mr. Darling won her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), and they all ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) house to propose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped in first, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) got all of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), except the innermost box and the kiss. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) never knew about the box, and in time he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) gave up trying for the kiss.
<p/>Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door.
<p/>Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother not only loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) but respected him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares.
<p/>Of course no one really knows, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) quite seemed to know, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>).
<p/>Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) kept the books perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) drew them when she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) should have been totting up. They were Mrs. Darling's guesses. Wendy came first, then John, then Michael.
<p/>For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was another mouth to feed.
<p/>Mr. Darling was frightfully proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was very honourable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) sat on the edge of Mrs. Darling's bed, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand and calculating expenses, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) imploringly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) way; his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) confused him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) with suggestions he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had to begin at the beginning again.
<p/>I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven--who is that moving?--eight nine seven, dot and carry seven--don't speak, my own--and the pound you lent to that man who came to the door--quiet, child--dot and carry child--there, you've done it!--did
<p/>'' Now don't interrupt,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would beg of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' I say nine nine seven? yes, I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on nine nine seven?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we can, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried. But she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was prejudiced in Wendy's favour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was really the grander character of the two.
<p/>'' Remember mumps,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) almost threateningly, and off he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went again. '' Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay it will be more like thirty shillings--
<p/>don't speak--measles one five , German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six-- don't waggle your finger--whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings''--and
<p/>so on it went, and it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated as one.
<p/>There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten school, accompanied by their nurse.
<p/>Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a passion for being exactly like his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse.
<p/>As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) in Kensington Gardens, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) spent most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses.
<p/>How thorough she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) charges made the slightest cry.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) believed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on.
<p/>It was a lesson in propriety to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. Of course her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) kennel was in the nursery. On John's footer -LSB-in England soccer was called football, <div class="bookquote">``footer''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>for short-RSB- days
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) never once forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sweater, and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) usually carried an umbrella in her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school where the nurses wait.
<p/>They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. They affected to ignore her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) despised their light talk.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling's friends, but if they did come she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) first whipped off Michael's pinafore and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's hair.
<p/>No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darling knew it, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) position in the city to consider. Nana also troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) in another way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had sometimes a feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) did not admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>).
<p/>I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) admires you tremendously, George,'' Mrs. Darling would assure him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) would sign to the children to be specially nice to father.
<p/>Such a midget she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) looked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) long skirt and maid's cap, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had sworn, when engaged, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) would never see ten again.
<p/>'' Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. The gaiety of those romps!
<p/>And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) you might have got it.
<p/>There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan. Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was tidying up her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) children's minds.
<p/>It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.
<p/>If you could keep awake -LRB-but of course you can't-RRB- you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>You would see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight.
<p/>When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.
<p/>It is quite like tidying up drawers. I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind.
<p/>Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time.
<p/>There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose.
<p/>It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.
<p/>John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it.
<p/>John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together.
<p/>John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth.
<p/>Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles -LSB-simple
<p/>boat-RSB-. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.
<p/>Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed.
<p/>When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real.
<p/>Occasionally in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) travels through her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew of no Peter, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>).
<p/>The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.
<p/>That is why there are night-lights. '' Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) is rather cocky,'' Wendy admitted with regret. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother had been questioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) childhood she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies.
<p/>There were odd stories about him (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>), as that when children died he (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) went part of the way with them, so that they should not be frightened.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) at the time, but now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was married and full of sense she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) quite doubted whether there was any such person.
<p/>'' But who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>), my pet?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) is Peter Pan, you know, mother. '' '' Besides,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said to Wendy, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) would be grown up by this time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) size in both mind and body; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) didn't know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knew, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) just knew it.
<p/>'' Oh no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) isn't grown up,'' Wendy assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) confidently, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) is just my size. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) smiled pooh-pooh. ''
<p/>Mark my words,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have.
<p/>Leave it alone, and it will blow over. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite a shock.
<p/>For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them. It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation.
<p/>Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile: <div class="bookquote">``I do believe it is that Peter again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Whatever do you mean, Wendy?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is so naughty of him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) not to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) feet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>Wendy said, sighing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was a tidy child.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) bed and played on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) pipes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>Unfortunately she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) never woke, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) didn't know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knew, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) just knew. '' What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without knocking.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) comes in by the window,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. '' My love, it is three floors up.'' <div class="bookquote">``Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?
<p/>Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had been dreaming.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window. '' My child,'' the mother cried, <div class="bookquote">``why did you not tell me of this before?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>said Wendy lightly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was in a hurry to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breakfast. Oh, surely she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) must have been dreaming.
<p/>Mrs. Darling examined them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in England.
<p/>But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) crawled about the floor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.
<p/>But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. Certainly Wendy had been dreaming. On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed.
<p/>It happened to be Nana's evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) hand and slid away into the land of sleep.
<p/>All were looking so safe and cosy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.
<p/>The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling's lap.
<p/>It was something for Michael, who on his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) birthday was getting into shirts. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was asleep.
<p/>Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire. There should have been a fourth night-light.
<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) slept she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had a dream. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not alarm her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) before in the faces of many women who have no children.
<p/>But in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) dream he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap.
<p/>The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which darted about the room like a living thing
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is to be found in the faces of some mothers also. and I think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knew at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was Peter Pan.
<p/>If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was very like Mrs. Darling's kiss.
<p/>the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancing thing about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) first teeth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was a grown-up, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gnashed the little pearls at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter 2 THE SHADOW Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and Nana entered, returned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) evening out.
<p/>Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time in distress for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was killed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) ran down into the street to look for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little body, but it was not there; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) looked up, and in the black night she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) could see nothing
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) thought was a shooting star.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) leapt at the window Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shadow had not had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) mouth, which proved to be the boy's shadow. You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quite the ordinary kind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) hung it out at the window, meaning ``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is sure to come back for it; let us put it where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can get it easily without disturbing the children.
<p/>But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was totting up winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) head to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>); besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) knew exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) would say: <div class="bookquote">``It all comes of having a dog for a nurse.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) husband.
<p/>Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Ah me! The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday.
<p/>I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) used to say afterwards to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>), holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Of course it was a Friday. '' '' No, no,'' Mr. Darling always said, <div class="bookquote">``I am responsible for it all. I, George Darling, did it.
<p/>They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage.
<p/>MEA CULPA, MEA CULPA. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darling</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had had a classical education. '' If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,'' Mrs. Darling said.
<p/>'' If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana's bowl,'' said Mr. Darling. '' If only I had pretended to like the medicine,'' was what Nana's wet eyes said.
<p/>'' My liking for parties, George.'' '' My fatal gift of humour, dearest.'' '' My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.
<p/>'' Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the thought, <div class="bookquote">``It's true , it's true, they ought not to have had a dog for a nurse.
<p/>Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana's bark was the echo of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the right-hand corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) mouth that wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) not to call Peter names.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Nana</b></font>)</div>Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to Nana's eyes. '' That fiend! '' They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening.
<p/>It had begun so uneventfully, so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for Michael's bath and carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) to it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) back.
<p/>I won't go to bed,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had shouted, like one who still believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had the last word on the subject, <div class="bookquote">``I won't, I won't.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan't love you any more, Nana. I tell you I won't be bathed, I won't, I won't!''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) evening-gown, with the necklace George had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>).
<p/>Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) white evening-gown. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was wearing Wendy's bracelet on her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) arm; she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had asked for the loan of it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of Wendy's birth, and John was saying: <div class="bookquote">``I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real occasion.
<p/>Wendy loved to lend her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) bracelet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother. Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.
<p/>Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) conceived due to the birth of a male, and Michael came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) bath to ask to be born also, but John said brutally that they did not want any more.
<p/>Michael had nearly cried. '' Nobody wants me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) said, and of course the lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.
<p/>'' I do,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I so want a third child.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Boy or girl? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div>asked Michael, not too hopefully. ''
<p/>Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be Michael's last night in the nursery.
<p/>Boy. '' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had leapt into her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) arms. They go on with their recollections. '' It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn't it?
<p/>'' Mr. Darling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had been like a tornado. Perhaps there was some excuse for him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>), too, had been dressing for the party, and all had gone well with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) tie.
<p/>It is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew about stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tie.
<p/>Sometimes the thing yielded to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without a contest, but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pride and used a made-up tie.
<p/>This was such an occasion. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' Why, what is the matter, father dear?'' <div class="bookquote">``Matter! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yelled; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really yelled. '' This tie, it will not tie.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became dangerously sarcastic. '' Not round my neck! Round the bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my neck, no!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on sternly, <div class="bookquote">``I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck we don't go out to dinner to-night, and if I don't go out to dinner to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don't go to the office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the streets.
<p/>Let me try, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, and indeed that was what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to do, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nice cool hands she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tied his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tie for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), while the children stood around to see their fate decided.
<p/>Some men would have resented her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) being able to do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) carelessly, at once forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) back.
<p/>Oh dear no! begs to be excused! '' '' Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. '' '' How wildly we romped!'' says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.
<p/>'' Our last romp! '' Mr. Darling groaned. '' O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, `How did you get to know me, mother?'''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Darling</b></font>)</div>'' They were rather sweet, don't you think, George?'' '' And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.
<p/>The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>), covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) trousers with hairs.
<p/>They were not only new trousers, but they were the first he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had ever had with braid on them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had had to bite his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) lip to prevent the tears coming.
<p/>Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.
<p/>'' '' George, Nana is a treasure. '' <div class="bookquote">``No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) looks upon the children as puppies.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) knows they have souls. '' <div class="bookquote">``I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darling</b></font>)</div>Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darling</b></font>)</div>It was an opportunity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) wife felt, for telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) about the boy. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) pooh-poohed the story, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) became thoughtful when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) the shadow.
<p/>'' It is nobody I know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) said, examining it carefully, <div class="bookquote">``but it does look a scoundrel. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We were still discussing it, you remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darling</b></font>)</div>says Mr. Darling, <div class="bookquote">``when Nana came in with Michael's medicine.
<p/>You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darling</b></font>)</div>Strong man though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, there is no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a weakness, it was for thinking that all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana's mouth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had said reprovingly, <div class="bookquote">``Be a man, Michael.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't; won't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div>Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of firmness.
<p/>'' Mother, don't pamper him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) called after her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). '' Michael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) night-gown, believed it also, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, to encourage Michael, <div class="bookquote">``That medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ever so much nastier,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darling</b></font>)</div>Mr. Darling said bravely, <div class="bookquote">``and I would take it now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn't lost the bottle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had not exactly lost it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there.
<p/>I said, `Thank you, kind parents, for giving me bottles to make me well.' ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darling</b></font>)</div>'' What he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) did not know was that the faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) wash-stand.
<p/>'' I know where it is, father,'' Wendy cried, always glad to be of service. '' I'll bring it,'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was off before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>Immediately his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spirits sank in the strangest way. '' John,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, shuddering, <div class="bookquote">``it's most beastly stuff. It's that nasty, sticky, sweet kind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will soon be over, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>John said cheerily, and then in rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass. ''
<p/>I have been as quick as I could,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) panted. '' You have been wonderfully quick,'' her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) father retorted, with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). ''
<p/>Michael first,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) said doggedly. '' Father first,'' said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature. '' I shall be sick, you know,'' Mr. Darling said threateningly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>said John. '' Hold your tongue, John,'' his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father rapped out. Wendy was quite puzzled. '' I thought you took it quite easily, father.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not the point,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) retorted. '' The point is, that there is more in my glass than in Michael's spoon.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) proud heart was nearly bursting. '' And it isn't fair: I would say it though it were with my last breath; it isn't fair.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, I am waiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div>said Michael coldly. '' It's all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.
<p/>'' '' Father's a cowardly custard. '' '' So are you a cowardly custard. '' <div class="bookquote">``I'm not frightened. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Neither am I frightened.
<p/>'' '' Well, then, take it.'' '' Well, then, you take it. '' Wendy had a splendid idea. '' Why not both take it at the same time?''
<p/>'' Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) medicine, but Mr. Darling slipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darling</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Darling. '' Are you ready, Michael? There was a yell of rage from Michael, and <div class="bookquote">``O father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div>Wendy exclaimed.
<p/>'' What do you mean by 'O father'? '' Mr. Darling demanded. '' Stop that row, Michael. I meant to take mine, but I--
<p/>I missed it. '' It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), just as if they did not admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>).
<p/>'' Look here, all of you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) said entreatingly, as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. '' I have just thought of a splendid joke.
<p/>It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father's sense of humour, and they looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reproachfully as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) poured the medicine into Nana's bowl.
<p/>I shall pour my medicine into Nana's bowl, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) will drink it, thinking it is milk! '' '' What fun!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said doubtfully, and they did not dare expose him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned. '' Nana, good dog,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, patting her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have put a little milk into your bowl, Nana.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) kennel.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Nana wagged her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) would not give in.
<p/>In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. '' O George,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's your medicine!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was only a joke,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) roared, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) boys, and Wendy hugged Nana.
<p/>'' Much good,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And still Wendy hugged Nana.
<p/>'' That's right,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shouted. '' Coddle her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>)! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner , why should I be coddled--why, why, why!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Darling</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Darling entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``not so loud; the servants will hear you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the servants.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let them!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) answered recklessly. <div class="bookquote">``Bring in the whole world. But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The children</b></font>)</div>The children wept, and Nana ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) beseechingly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) back. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was a strong man again.
<p/>In vain, in vain,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up this instant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``George, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Darling</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Darling whispered, <div class="bookquote">``remember what I told you about that boy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Darling</b></font>)</div>Alas, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would not listen. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was determined to show who was master in that house, and
<p/>when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lured her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) out of it with honeyed words, and seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) roughly, dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) from the nursery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was ashamed of himself, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did it. It was all owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) too affectionate nature, which craved for admiration.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had tied her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) up in the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the passage, with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knuckles to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>They could hear Nana barking, and John whimpered, <div class="bookquote">``It is because he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is chaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) up in the yard,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>but Wendy was wiser.
<p/>That is not Nana's unhappy bark,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) said, little guessing what was about to happen; <div class="bookquote">``that is her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) bark when she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) smells danger.
<p/>In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night-lights. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Danger!
<p/>'' Are you sure, Wendy?'' '' Oh, yes. '' Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened.
<p/>They were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>).
<p/>Yet a nameless fear clutched at her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) heart and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) cry, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, how I wish that I wasn't going to a party to-night!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div><p/>Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was perturbed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. '' Nothing, precious,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``they are the eyes a mother leaves behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to guard her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little Michael flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). '' Mother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of you.
<p/>No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of snow, and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their shoes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They were the last words she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) was to hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) for a long time. They were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars were watching them.
<p/>It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was.
<p/>So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak -LRB-winking is the star language-RRB-, but the little ones still wonder.
<p/>They are not really friendly to Peter, who had a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) side to-night, and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way.
<p/>So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament, and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way screamed out:
<p/>Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in anything, they must just look on for ever. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Peter!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Chapter 3 COME AWAY, COME AWAY!
<p/>For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly.
<p/>They were awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all the three went out.
<p/>There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter's shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out.
<p/>It was not really a light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still growing.
<p/>It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) figure could be seen to the best advantage.
<p/>A moment after the fairy's entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was slightly inclined to EMBONPOINT. -LSB-plump hourglass figure-RSB- He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had carried Tinker Bell part of the way, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hand was still messy with the fairy dust.
<p/>'' Tinker Bell,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) called softly, after making sure that the children were asleep, <div class="bookquote">``Tink, where are you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was in a jug for the moment, and liking it extremely; she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had never been in a jug before.
<p/>'' Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my shadow? '' The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>).
<p/>You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) meant the chest of drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to the floor with both hands, as kings toss ha`pence to the crowd.
<p/>In a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) shadow, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) delight he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) forgot that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tinker</b></font>) thought at all, but I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Tinker</b></font>) ever thought, it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tinker</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tinker</b></font>) shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops of water, and when they did not he (<font color='blue'><b>Tinker</b></font>) was appalled.
<p/>It is the fairy language. Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tinker</b></font>) tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed.
<p/>A shudder passed through Peter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sat on the floor and cried. His (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sobs woke Wendy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sat up in bed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was only pleasantly interested. '' Boy,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said courteously, <div class="bookquote">``why are you crying?
<p/>Peter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) rose and bowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) beautifully.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was much pleased, and bowed beautifully to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) from the bed. '' What's your name? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) asked. ''
<p/>Wendy Moira Angela Darling,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) replied with some satisfaction. '' What is your name?'' <div class="bookquote">``Peter Pan. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) was already sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) must be Peter, but it did seem a comparatively short name.
<p/>'' Is that all?'' '' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said rather sharply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) felt for the first time that it was a shortish name.
<p/>'' I'm so sorry,'' said Wendy Moira Angela. '' It doesn't matter,'' Peter gulped. She (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) asked where he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) lived. '' Second to the right,'' said Peter, <div class="bookquote">``and then straight on till morning.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What a funny address! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Peter had a sinking. For the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) felt that perhaps it was a funny address.
<p/>'' No, it isn't,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said. '' I mean,'' Wendy said nicely, remembering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was hostess, <div class="bookquote">``is that what they put on the letters?''
 (<font color='red'><b>hostess</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had not mentioned letters. '' Don't get any letters,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said contemptuously. '' But your mother gets letters?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't have a mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said. Not only had he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) no mother, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had not the slightest desire to have one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thought them very over-rated persons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was in the presence of a tragedy. ''
<p/>O Peter, no wonder you were crying,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, and got out of bed and ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). '' I wasn't crying about mothers,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said rather indignantly.
<p/>'' I was crying because I can't get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn't crying. '' <div class="bookquote">``It has come off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was frightfully sorry for Peter. ''
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could not help smiling when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had been trying to stick it on with soap.
<p/>How awful! '' How exactly like a boy! Fortunately she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knew at once what to do. '' It must be sewn on,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, just a little patronisingly.
<p/>'' What's sewn?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked. '' You're dreadfully ignorant.'' '' No, I'm not. '' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was exulting in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ignorance.
<p/>I shall sew it on for you, my little man,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was tall as herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) got out her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) housewife -LSB-sewing bag-RSB-, and sewed the shadow on to Peter's foot.
<p/>'' '' I daresay it will hurt a little,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). '' Oh, I shan't cry,'' said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had never cried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) life.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) teeth and did not cry, and soon his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) shadow was behaving properly, though still a little creased.
<p/>Perhaps I should have ironed it,'' Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was now jumping about in the wildest glee.
<p/>'' Alas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had already forgotten that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) owed his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) bliss to Wendy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had attached the shadow himself.
<p/>'' How clever I am! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) crowed rapturously, <div class="bookquote">``oh, the cleverness of me! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) most fascinating qualities.
<p/>To put it with brutal frankness, there never was a cockier boy. But for the moment Wendy was shocked. '' You conceit -LSB-braggart-RSB-,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) exclaimed, with frightful sarcasm; <div class="bookquote">``of course I did nothing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) replied with hauteur -LSB-pride-RSB-; <div class="bookquote">``if I am no use I can at least withdraw,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face with the blankets.
<p/>To induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) to look up he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pretended to be going away, and when this failed he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sat on the end of the bed and tapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) gently with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) foot.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance. '' A little! '' Wendy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``don't withdraw. I can't help crowing, Wendy, when I'm pleased with myself.
<p/>Wendy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) continued, in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, <div class="bookquote">``Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty boys.
<p/>Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many inches, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) peeped out of the bed-clothes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>no woman</b></font>)</div>Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would not look up, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was listening eagerly. '' '' '' Do you really think so, Peter?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's perfectly sweet of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) declared, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll get up again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sat with him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) on the side of the bed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) also said she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) a kiss if he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) liked, but Peter did not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) meant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hand expectantly.
<p/>I shall know when you give it to me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) replied stiffly, and not to hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) a thimble.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Surely you know what a kiss is? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked, aghast. '' '' Now,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``shall I give you a kiss?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) made herself rather cheap by inclining her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) merely dropped an acorn button into her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) slowly returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face to where it had been before, and said nicely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would wear his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) kiss on the chain around her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) neck.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) replied with a slight primness, <div class="bookquote">``If you please. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was lucky that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did put it on that chain, for it was afterwards to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) life.
<p/>When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask each other's age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct thing, asked Peter how old he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was.
<p/>It was not really a happy question to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>); it was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what you want to be asked is Kings of England.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) really knew nothing about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had merely suspicions, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said at a venture, <div class="bookquote">``Wendy, I ran away the day I was born.
<p/>Wendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) indicated in the charming drawing-room manner, by a touch on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) night-gown, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could sit nearer her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>It was because I heard father and mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) explained in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``talking about what I was to be when I became a man.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I don't know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied uneasily, <div class="bookquote">``but I am quite young. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was extraordinarily agitated now.
<p/>'' I don't want ever to be a man,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said with passion. '' I want always to be a little boy and to have fun.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a look of the most intense admiration, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had run away, but it was really because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew fairies.
<p/>So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies. '' Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) as quite delightful.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) poured out questions about them, to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) surprise, for they were rather a nuisance to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), getting in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way
<p/>and so on, and indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sometimes had to give them a hiding -LSB-spanking-RSB-. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) liked them on the whole, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) about the beginning of fairies.
<p/>You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies.
<p/>'' '' Tedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) liked it. '' And so,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went on good-naturedly, <div class="bookquote">``there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>You see children know such a lot now, they soon don't believe in fairies, and every time a child says, 'I don't believe in fairies,' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.
<p/>Really, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ought to be? Isn't there?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No. '' '' I can't think where she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) has gone to,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) said, rising, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) called Tink by name.
<p/>Wendy's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill. '' Peter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cried, clutching him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you don't mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was here just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said a little impatiently. '' You don't hear her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>), do you?'' and they both listened.
<p/>'' The only sound I hear,'' said Wendy, <div class="bookquote">``is like a tinkle of bells. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>'' Well, that's Tink, that's the fairy language.
<p/>I think I hear her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) too. '' The sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face.
<p/>No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of gurgles was his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) laugh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) first laugh still.
<p/>'' Wendy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) whispered gleefully, <div class="bookquote">``I do believe I shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) up in the drawer! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) flew about the nursery screaming with fury.
<p/>'' You shouldn't say such things,'' Peter retorted. '' Of course I'm very sorry, but how could I know you were in the drawer?
<p/>'' Wendy was not listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). '' O Peter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would only stand still and let me see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They hardly ever stand still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, but for one moment Wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock.
<p/>'' O the lovely! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cried, though Tink's face was still distorted with passion. <div class="bookquote">``Tink,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter amiably, <div class="bookquote">``this lady says she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wishes you were her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fairy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Tinker Bell answered insolently. '' What does she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) say, Peter?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had to translate. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is not very polite.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says you are a great -LSB-huge-RSB- ugly girl, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is my fairy. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) tried to argue with Tink.
<p/>'' You know you can't be my fairy, Tink, because I am an gentleman and you are a lady. '' To this Tink replied in these words, <div class="bookquote">``You silly ass,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and disappeared into the bathroom.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is quite a common fairy,'' Peter explained apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) is called Tinker Bell because she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) mends the pots and kettles -LSB-tinker = tin worker-RSB-.

<p/>'' If you don't live in Kensington Gardens now-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I do still.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But where do you live mostly now?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With the lost boys. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>'' They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way.

<p/>'' '' What fun it must be!'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>said cunning Peter, <div class="bookquote">``but we are rather lonely. You see we have no female companionship.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are none of the others girls?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their prams.
<p/>'' This flattered Wendy immensely. '' I think,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises us.
<p/>This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with spirit that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was not captain in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) house.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one kick. However, John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to remain there.
<p/>'' And I know you meant to be kind,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, relenting, <div class="bookquote">``so you may give me a kiss. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ignorance about kisses.
<p/>'' I thought you would want it back,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said a little bitterly, and offered to return her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) the thimble. ''
<p/>Oh dear,'' said the nice Wendy, <div class="bookquote">``I don't mean a kiss, I mean a thimble. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>'' What's that?'' '' It's like this.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Funny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter gravely. '' Now shall I give you a thimble?'' <div class="bookquote">``If you wish to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>said Wendy, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) head erect this time.
<p/>Peter thimbled her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), and almost immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) screeched. '' What is it, Wendy?'' '' It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That must have been Tink. I never knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) so naughty before. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive language.

<p/>Peter could not understand why, but Wendy understood, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was just slightly disappointed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) admitted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) came to the nursery window not to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) but to listen to stories.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Again Tink replied, <div class="bookquote">``You silly ass. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' You see, I don't know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any stories.

(<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had become frightfully cunning. '' Wendy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``how we should all respect you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was wriggling her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) body in distress. It was quite as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) were trying to remain on the nursery floor.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had no pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). '' Wendy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, the sly one, <div class="bookquote">``you could tuck us in at night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oo!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``None of us has ever been tucked in at night.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oo,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms went out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). '' And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us.
<p/>None of us has any pockets. '' How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) resist. '' Of course it's awfully fascinating! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cried. ''
<p/>Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?'' '' If you like,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said indifferently, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ran to John and Michael and shook them.
<p/>'' Wake up,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``Peter Pan has come and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) is to teach us to fly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>John rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' Then I shall get up,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was on the floor already. '' Hallo,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence.
<p/>Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world. All was as still as salt.
<p/>Then everything was right. No, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana, who had been barking distressfully all the evening, was quiet now.
<p/>It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) silence they had heard. '' Out with the light! Hide! Quick! '' cried John, taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure.
<p/>And thus when Liza entered, holding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept.
<p/>Liza was in a bad temper, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) cheek, by Nana's absurd suspicions.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course.
<p/>They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains. '' There, you suspicious brute,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) said, not sorry that Nana was in disgrace.
<p/>'' They are perfectly safe, aren't they? Every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing.
<p/>'' Here Michael, encouraged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) success, breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) tried to drag herself out of Liza's clutches.
<p/>I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then, oh, won't master whip you, just.
<p/>But Liza was dense. '' No more of it, Nana,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) said sternly, pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) out of the room. '' ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to bark? Bring master and missus home from the party!
<p/>Why, that was just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) wanted. Do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) cared whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) was whipped so long as her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) charges were safe?
<p/>Unfortunately Liza returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) puddings, and Nana, seeing that no help would come from her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>), strained and strained at the chain until at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) broke it.
<p/>In another moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) paws to heaven, her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) most expressive way of making a communication.
<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery, and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.
<p/>But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.
<p/>We now return to the nursery. '' It's all right,'' John announced, emerging from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hiding-place. '' I say, Peter, can you really fly?
<p/>'' Instead of troubling to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) Peter flew around the room, taking the mantelpiece on the way. '' How topping!'' said John and Michael.
<p/>It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.
<p/>'' How sweet! '' cried Wendy. '' Yes, I'm sweet, oh, I am sweet!'' said Peter, forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) manners again. ''
<p/>I say, how do you do it? '' asked John, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knee. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was quite a practical boy. '' You just think lovely wonderful thoughts,'' Peter explained, <div class="bookquote">``and they lift you up in the air.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) showed them again. '' You're so nippy at it,'' John said, <div class="bookquote">``couldn't you do it very slowly once? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div><p/>Peter did it both slowly and quickly. '' I've got it now, Wendy!'' cried John, but soon he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had not.
<p/>Not one of them could fly an inch, though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not know A from Z.
<p/>Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>Fortunately, as we have mentioned, one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hands was messy with it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) blew some on each of them, with the most superb results.
<p/>'' Now just wiggle your shoulders this way,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and let go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) did not quite mean to let go, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) did it, and immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was borne across the room. ''
<p/>I flewed! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) screamed while still in mid-air. John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom. '' Oh, lovely!''
<p/>They were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a little, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is almost nothing so delicious as that.
<p/>'' Oh, ripping!'' <div class="bookquote">``Look at me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look at me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look at me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Peter gave Wendy a hand at first, but had to desist, Tink was so indignant.
<p/>Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy's word. '' I say,'' cried John, <div class="bookquote">``why shouldn't we all go out?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them. Michael was ready: he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) wanted to see how long it took him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) to do a billion miles.
<p/>But Wendy hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Mermaids!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter again. '' Oo!'' '' And there are pirates.'' <div class="bookquote">``Pirates,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>cried John, seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) Sunday hat, <div class="bookquote">``let us go at once.
<p/>They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window; and, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze with light, and most heart-gripping sight of all, they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round, not on the floor but in the air.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27. Not three figures, four!
<p/>In a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have rushed upstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) to go softly.
<p/>If so, how delightful for them, and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story.
<p/>On the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) even tried to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) heart go softly. Will they reach the nursery in time? They would have reached the nursery
<p/>in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window open, and that smallest star of all called out:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cave, Peter! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. <div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John and Michael and Wendy.
<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The birds were flown. Chapter 4 THE FLIGHT <div class="bookquote">``Second to the right, and straight on till morning.
<p/>That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even birds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not have sighted it with these instructions.
<p/>At first his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) companions trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) implicitly, and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy.
<p/>They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Peter, you see, just said anything that came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) head. John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start. Not long ago.
<p/>But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was their second sea and their third night.
<p/>Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they merely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and snatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will.
<p/>But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that there are other ways.
<p/>Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that was a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell.
<p/>Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold and again too warm. The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny.
<p/>'' There he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) goes again! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly dropped like a stone. <div class="bookquote">``Save him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), save him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>)!
<p/>Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch Michael just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) always waited till the last moment, and you felt it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cleverness that interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) and not the saving of human life.
<p/>Also he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) one moment would suddenly cease to engage him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would let you go.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) back and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was so light that if you got behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) and blew he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) went faster.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel sea far below. '' Do be more polite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>),'' Wendy whispered to John, when they were playing <div class="bookquote">``Follow my Leader.''
 (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div><p/>When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and touch each shark's tail in passing, just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing.
<p/>They could not follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) in this with much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) to stop showing off,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>said John. '' You must be nice to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>),'' Wendy impressed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) brothers.
<p/>'' What could we do if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) were to leave us!'' <div class="bookquote">``We could go back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div>Michael said. '' How could we ever find our way back without him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>)?''
<p/>'' Well, then, we could go on,'' said John. '' That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we don't know how to stop.
<p/>John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come back to their own window.
<p/>'' This was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop. '' And who is to get food for us, John?''
<p/>And even though we became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and things if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is not near to give us a hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I nipped a bit out of that eagle's mouth pretty neatly, Wendy.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``After the twentieth try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>Wendy reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). '' ''
<p/>They could now fly strongly, though they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump into it.
<p/>Indeed they were constantly bumping. If Nana had been with them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) would have had a bandage round Michael's forehead by this time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) could go so much faster than they that he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had been saying to a star, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had already forgotten what it was, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening.
<p/>Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves. It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid.
<p/>'' And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) forgets them so quickly,'' Wendy argued, <div class="bookquote">``how can we expect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) will go on remembering us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw recognition come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) by name.
<p/>Indeed, sometimes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) returned he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did not remember them, at least not well. Wendy was sure of it. '' I'm Wendy,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said agitatedly.
<p/>I say, Wendy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), ``always if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying `I'm Wendy,' and then I'll remember.
<p/>However, to make amends he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found that they could sleep thus with security.
<p/>Indeed they would have slept longer, but Peter tired quickly of sleeping, and soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would cry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) captain voice, <div class="bookquote">``We get off here.
<p/>So with occasional tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for after many moons they did reach it, and, what is more, they had been going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was looking for them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was very sorry. ''  (<font color='red'><b>captain</b></font>)</div>'' Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. '' It is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores.
<p/>Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children, all directed by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of their way before leaving them for the night.
<p/>'' There it is,'' said Peter calmly. '' Where, where?'' <div class="bookquote">``Where all the arrows are pointing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their first sight of the island.
<p/>Strange to say, they all recognized it at once, and until fear fell upon them they hailed it, not as something long dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the holidays.
<p/>'' John, there's the lagoon. '' <div class="bookquote">``Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, Michael, there's your cave!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``John, what's that in the brushwood?''  (<font color='red'><b>a wolf</b></font>)</div>'' It's a wolf with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) whelps. Wendy, I do believe that's your little whelp!''
<p/>'' There's my boat, John, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sides stove in!'' '' No, it isn't. Why, we burned your boat. '' ''
<p/>That's her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the redskin camp!'' <div class="bookquote">``Where? Show me, and I'll tell you by the way smoke curls whether they are on the war-path.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/>Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) wanted to lord it over them his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) triumph was at hand, for have I not told you that anon fear fell upon them?
<p/>'' There, just across the Mysterious River.'' <div class="bookquote">``I see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.
<p/>Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now, and above all, you lost the certainty that you would win.
<p/>In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime. You were quite glad that the night-lights were on.
<p/>You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here, and that the Neverland was all make-believe.
<p/>Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was real now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker every moment, and where was Nana?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) careless manner had gone at last, his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went through them every time they touched his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) body.
<p/>They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. They were now over the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet.
<p/>Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces.
<p/>Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) fists. '' They don't want us to land,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) explained.
<p/>'' Who are they?'' Wendy whispered, shuddering. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) shoulder, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) wakened her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) on in front.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) ear, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth.
<p/>Having done these things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) went on again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) courage was almost appalling. '' Would you like an adventure now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) said casually to John, <div class="bookquote">``or would you like to have your tea first?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>Wendy said <div class="bookquote">``tea first''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>quickly, and Michael pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand in gratitude, but the braver John hesitated. '' What kind of adventure?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked cautiously. '' There's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,'' Peter told him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). '' If you like, we'll go down and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>John said after a long pause. '' I do.'' <div class="bookquote">``Suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>John said, a little huskily, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) were to wake up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div><p/>Peter spoke indignantly. '' You don't think I would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was sleeping! I would wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) first, and then kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>That's the way I always do. '' <div class="bookquote">``I say! Do you kill many?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tons. ''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>John said <div class="bookquote">``How ripping,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>but decided to have tea first.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked if there were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had never known so many.
<p/>'' Who is captain now?'' <div class="bookquote">``Hook,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>answered Peter, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) face became very stern as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said that hated word. ''
<p/>Jas. Hook?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ay. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div>Then indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps only, for they knew Hook's reputation.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was Blackbeard's bo`sun,'' John whispered huskily. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is the worst of them all. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid.
<p/>'' '' That's him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>),'' said Peter. '' What is he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) like? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) big?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) is not so big as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cut off a bit of him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter sharply. '' I wasn't meaning to be disrespectful.''
<p/>'' Oh, all right.'' '' But, I say, what bit?'' <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) right hand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) can't fight now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, can't he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) just!''

<p/>For the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying with them, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) light they could distinguish each other.
<p/>Unfortunately she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) could not fly so slowly as they, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo.
<p/>Wendy quite liked it, until Peter pointed out the drawbacks. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) tells me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that the pirates sighted us before the darkness came, and got Long Tom out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The big gun?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. And of course they must see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) light, and if they guess we are near it they are sure to let fly.

''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a loving little pinch.
<p/>'' Then tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>),'' Wendy begged, <div class="bookquote">``to put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) light.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) can't put it out. That is about the only thing fairies can't do.

<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) can't sleep except when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)'s sleepy. It is the only other thing fairies can't do.'' <div class="bookquote">``Seems to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>growled John, <div class="bookquote">``these are the only two things worth doing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) got a pinch, but not a loving one. '' If only one of us had a pocket,'' Peter said, <div class="bookquote">``we could carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) in it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had a happy idea. John's hat! Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John carried it, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had hoped to be carried by Peter.
<p/>Presently Wendy took the hat, because John said it struck against his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knee as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) flew; and this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy.
<p/>It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said it was the redskins sharpening their knives.
<p/>In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in silence. Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful.
<p/>'' If only something would make a sound!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) cried. As if in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) request, the air was rent by the most tremendous crash he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had ever heard.
<p/>The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to cry savagely, <div class="bookquote">``Where are they, where are they, where are they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The pirates</b></font>)</div><p/>The pirates had fired Long Tom at them. Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of make-believe and the same island come true.
<p/>When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found themselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air mechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was floating.
<p/>'' Are you shot?'' John whispered tremulously. '' I haven't tried -LSB-myself out-RSB- yet,'' Michael whispered back. We know now that no one had been hit.
<p/>Peter, however, had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was blown upwards with no companion but Tinker Bell.
<p/>I don't know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had planned it on the way, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) at once popped out of the hat and began to lure Wendy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) destruction.
<p/>It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had dropped the hat. Tink was not all bad; or, rather
<p/>Fairies have to be one thing or the other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time.
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was all bad just now, but, on the other hand, sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was all good. They are, however, allowed to change, only it must be a complete change.
<p/>tinkle Wendy could not of course understand, and I believe some of it was bad words, but it sounded kind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) flew back and forward, plainly meaning <div class="bookquote">``Follow me, and all will be well.
<p/>At present she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was full of jealousy of Wendy. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lovely ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>What else could poor Wendy do?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) called to Peter and John and Michael, and got only mocking echoes in reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did not yet know that Tink hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) with the fierce hatred of a very woman.
<p/>Chapter 5 THE ISLAND COME TRUE Feeling that Peter was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) way back, the Neverland had again woke into life.
<p/>And so, bewildered, and now staggering in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flight, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) followed Tink to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doom. We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is better and was always used by Peter.
<p/>The fairies take an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other.
<p/>But with the coming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they are under way again: if you put your ear to the ground now, you would hear the whole island seething with life.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) absence things are usually quiet on the island. On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows.
<p/>The lost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out looking for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and the beasts were out looking for the redskins.
<p/>They were going round and round the island, but they did not meet because all were going at the same rate.
<p/>The boys on the island vary, of course, in numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when they seem to be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but at this time there were six of them, counting the twins as two.
<p/>Let us pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch them as they steal by in single file, each with his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) dagger.
<p/>They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), and they wear the skins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so round and furry that when they fall they roll.
<p/>All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night were out to greet their captain. They have therefore become very sure-footed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had been in fewer adventures than any of them, because the big things constantly happened just when he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had stepped round the corner; all would be quiet, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) would take the opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood, and then when he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) returned the others would be sweeping up the blood.
<p/>This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) countenance, but instead of souring his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) nature had sweetened it, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was quite the humblest of the boys.
<p/>The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most unfortunate of all that gallant band. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air for you to-night.
<p/>Tootles, the fairy Tink, who is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool -LSB-for doing her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) mischief-RSB-, and she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) thinks you are the most easily tricked of the boys. '
<p/>Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if accepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Ware Tinker Bell.
<p/>Would that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) passes by, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) knuckles.
<p/>Next comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) own tunes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) remembers the days before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) was lost, with their manners and customs, and this has given his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) nose an offensive tilt.
<p/>Curly is fourth; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) is a pickle, -LSB-a person who gets in pickles-predicaments-RSB- and so often has he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) had to deliver up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) person when Peter said sternly, <div class="bookquote">``Stand forth the one who did this thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>that now at the command he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) stands forth automatically whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) has done it or not.
<p/>Slightly is the most conceited of the boys. Last come the Twins, who cannot be described because we should be sure to be describing the wrong one.
<p/>Peter never quite knew what twins were, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) band were not allowed to know anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did not know, so these two were always vague about themselves, and did their best to give satisfaction by keeping close together in an apologetic sort of way.
<p/>The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause, for things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track.
<p/>We hear them before they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful song: <div class="bookquote">``Avast belay, yo ho, heave to,
<p/>A-pirating we go, And if we're parted by a shot We're sure to meet below! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock.
<p/>Here, a little in advance, ever and again with his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head to the ground listening, his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) great arms bare, pieces of eight in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ears as ornaments, is the handsome Italian Cecco, who cut his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) name in letters of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao.
<p/>That gigantic black behind him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has had many names since he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of the Guadjo-mo.
<p/>Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) tattooed, the same Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the WALRUS from Flint before he (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) would drop the bag of moidores -LSB-Portuguese gold pieces-RSB-; and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy's brother -LRB-but this was never proved-RRB-, and Gentleman Starkey, once an usher in a public school and still dainty in his (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) ways of killing; and Skylights -LRB-Morgan's Skylights-RRB-; and the Irish bo`sun Smee, an oddly genial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only Non-conformist in Hook's crew; and Noodler, whose hands were fixed on backwards; and Robt.
<p/>In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclined James Hook, or as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) wrote himself, Jas.
<p/>Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian long known and feared on the Spanish Main. Hook, of whom it is said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) lay at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) ease in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) men, and instead of a right hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) had the iron hook with which ever and anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) encouraged them to increase their pace.
<p/>In person he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was cadaverous -LSB-dead looking-RSB- and blackavized -LSB-dark faced-RSB-, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) hair was dressed in long curls, which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularly threatening expression to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) handsome countenance.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) eyes were of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was plunging his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly.
<p/>In manner, something of the grand seigneur still clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) even ripped you up with an air, and I have been told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was a RACONTEUR -LSB-storyteller-RSB- of repute.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was never more sinister than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was most polite, which is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) diction, even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was swearing, no less than the distinction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) demeanour, showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) one of a different cast from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) crew.
<p/>A man of indomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shied at was the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour.
<p/>In dress he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) career that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mouth he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had a holder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own contrivance which enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to smoke two cigars at once.
<p/>As dogs this terrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) iron claw.
<p/>As they pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), ruffling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lace collar; the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech, then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on.
<p/>Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook's method. Skylights will do. He (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) has not even taken the cigars from his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path, which is not visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one of them with his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) eyes peeled.
<p/>Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will win? They carry tomahawks and knives, and their naked bodies gleam with paint and oil.
<p/>Strung around them are scalps, of boys as well as of pirates, for these are the Piccaninny tribe, and not to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the Hurons.
<p/>In the van, on all fours, is Great Big Little Panther, a brave of so many scalps that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) present position they somewhat impede his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) progress.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) is the most beautiful of dusky Dianas -LSB-Diana = goddess of the woods-RSB- and the belle of the Piccaninnies, coquettish -LSB-flirting-RSB-, cold and amorous -LSB-loving-RSB-
<p/>by turns; there is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to wife, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) staves off the altar with a hatchet.
<p/>Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest danger, comes Tiger Lily, proudly erect, a princess in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) own right. Observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise.
<p/>The fact is that they are all a little fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time they will work this off.
<p/>The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their place is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions, tigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee from them, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island.
<p/>The only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing. For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger. Their tongues are hanging out, they are hungry to-night.
<p/>When they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic crocodile. We shall see for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) is looking presently.
<p/>The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its pace.
<p/>Then quickly they will be on top of each other. All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the danger may be creeping up from behind.
<p/>This shows how real the island was. The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung themselves down on the sward -LSB-turf-RSB-, close to their underground home.
<p/>I do wish Peter would come back,'' every one of them said nervously, though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than their captain.
<p/>I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,'' Slightly said, in the tone that prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) being a general favourite; but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) added hastily, <div class="bookquote">``but I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) would come back, and tell us whether he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) has heard anything more about Cinderella.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) mother must have been very like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). It was only in Peter's absence that they could speak of mothers, the subject being forbidden by him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) as silly.
<p/>All I remember about my mother,'' Nibs told them, <div class="bookquote">``is that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) often said to my father, `Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own!'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>I don't know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my mother one. '' While they talked they heard a distant sound.
<p/>You or I, not being wild things of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and it was the grim song:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life, The flag o' skull and bones, A merry hour, a hempen rope, And hey for Davy Jones.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>At once the lost boys--but where are they? They are no longer there. Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.
<p/>With the exception of Nibs, who has darted away to reconnoitre -LSB-look around-RSB-, they are already in their home under the ground, a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently.
<p/>for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave.
<p/>Look closely, however, and you may note that there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy.
<p/>These are the seven entrances to the home under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these many moons.
<p/>As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs disappearing through the wood, and at once his (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) pistol flashed out.
<p/>I will tell you where they are. But how have they reached it? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) find it tonight? But an iron claw gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>'' Captain, let go! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) cried, writhing. Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice.
<p/>'' Put back that pistol first,'' it said threateningly. '' It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) dead.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily's redskins upon us. Do you want to lose your scalp?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Shall I after him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), Captain,'' asked pathetic Smee, <div class="bookquote">``and tickle him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) with Johnny Corkscrew?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Smee</b></font>)</div>Smee had pleasant names for everything, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) wiggled it in the wound. One could mention many lovable traits in Smee.
<p/>For instance, after killing, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) spectacles he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) wiped instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) weapon. '' Johnny's a silent fellow,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) reminded Hook.
<p/>'' Not now, Smee,'' Hook said darkly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) is only one, and I want to mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.
<p/>Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it was, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but there came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) a desire to confide to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) faithful bo`sun the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.
<p/>'' The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain and Smee were alone. Anon -LSB-later-RSB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) caught the word Peter.
<p/>'' Most of all,'' Hook was saying passionately, <div class="bookquote">``I want their captain, Peter Pan. ' Twas he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) cut off my arm.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Hook/James Hook</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) brandished the hook threateningly. '' I've waited long to shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) hand with this. Oh, I'll tear him (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>)!'' ''
<p/>And yet,'' said Smee, ``I have often heard you say that hook was worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>the captain answered, <div class="bookquote">``if I was a mother I would pray to have my children born with this instead of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) cast a look of pride upon his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) iron hand and one of scorn upon the other.
<p/>'' Then again he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) frowned. '' Peter flung my arm,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, wincing, <div class="bookquote">``to a crocodile that happened to be passing by.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I have often,'' said Smee, <div class="bookquote">``noticed your strange dread of crocodiles. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Smee</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not of crocodiles,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Hook corrected him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but of that one crocodile.
<p/>It liked my arm so much, Smee, that it has followed me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land, licking its lips for the rest of me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) voice. '' <div class="bookquote">``In a way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smee</b></font>)</div>said Smee, <div class="bookquote">``it's sort of a compliment.''  (<font color='red'><b>Smee</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I want no such compliments,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Hook barked petulantly.
<p/>'' I want Peter Pan, who first gave the brute its taste for me. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) voice.
<p/>Smee,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) said huskily, <div class="bookquote">``that crocodile would have had me before this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it, and so before it can reach me
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I hear the tick and bolt. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) laughed, but in a hollow way. '' Some day,'' said Smee, <div class="bookquote">``the clock will run down, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>)'ll get you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Smee</b></font>)</div>Hook wetted his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) dry lips. '' Ay,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that's the fear that haunts me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Since sitting down he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) had felt curiously warm.
<p/>'' Smee,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``this seat is hot. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) jumped up. '' Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I'm burning. ''
<p/>They examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on the mainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in their hands, for it had no root.
<p/>Stranger still, smoke began at once to ascend. The pirates looked at each other. '' A chimney! '' they both exclaimed.
<p/>They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood.
<p/>Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children's voices, for so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering.
<p/>The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom. They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees.
<p/>'' Did you hear them say Peter Pan's from home?'' Smee whispered, fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew. Hook nodded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a curdling smile lit up his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) swarthy face.
<p/>To return to the ship,'' Hook replied slowly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) teeth, <div class="bookquote">``and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.
<p/>Smee had been waiting for it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Hook/James Hook</b></font>)</div>Unrip your plan, captain,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) cried eagerly. '' There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney.
<p/>The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece. That shows they have no mother.
<p/>We will leave the cake on the shore of the Mermaids' Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids.
<p/>They will find the cake and they will gobble it up, because, having no mother, they don't know how dangerous 'tis to eat rich damp cake.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>mermaids</b></font>) burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest laughter. '' Aha, they will die. '' Smee had listened with growing admiration.
<p/>'' It's the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) cried, and in their exultation they danced and sang: <div class="bookquote">``Avast, belay, when I appear,
<p/>By fear they're overtook; Nought's left upon your bones when you Have shaken claws with Hook. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound broke in and stilled them.
<p/>There was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it was more distinct.
<p/>Tick tick tick tick! Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air. '' The crocodile! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) gasped, and bounded away, followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) bo`sun.
<p/>It was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now on the trail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook.
<p/>Once more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night were not yet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst, pursued by a pack of wolves.
<p/>The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out; the baying of them was horrible. '' Save me, save me! '' cried Nibs, falling on the ground.
<p/>'' But what can we do, what can we do? '' It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughts turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>'' What would Peter do? '' they cried simultaneously. Almost in the same breath they cried, <div class="bookquote">``Peter would look at them through his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) legs.
<p/>It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy they bent and looked through their legs.
<p/>The next moment is the long one, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in the terrible attitude, the wolves dropped their tails and fled.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then, <div class="bookquote">``Let us do what Peter would do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>Now Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) staring eyes still saw the wolves.
<p/>But it was not wolves he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) saw. '' I have seen a wonderfuller thing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried, as they gathered round him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) eagerly.
<p/>'' A great white bird. It is flying this way. '' <div class="bookquote">``What kind of a bird, do you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Nibs said, awestruck, <div class="bookquote">``but it looks so weary, and as it flies it moans, `Poor Wendy.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poor Wendy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Slightly instantly, <div class="bookquote">``there are birds called Wendies.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``See, it comes! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Curly</b></font>)</div>cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens.
<p/>Wendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) plaintive cry. But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell.
<p/>The jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship, and was darting at her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) victim from every direction, pinching savagely each time she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) touched.
<p/>'' Hullo, Tink,'' cried the wondering boys. Tink's reply rang out: <div class="bookquote">``Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us do what Peter wishes!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>cried the simple boys. '' Quick, bows and arrows!'' All but Tootles popped down their trees.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had a bow and arrow with him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), and Tink noted it, and rubbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) little hands. '' Quick, Tootles, quick,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) screamed.
<p/>Out of the way, Tink,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) shouted, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) fired, and Wendy fluttered to the ground with an arrow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) breast.
<p/>'' Peter will be so pleased. '' Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) bow. '' Chapter 6 THE LITTLE HOUSE
<p/>Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy's body when the other boys sprang, armed, from their trees. '' You are too late,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) cried proudly, <div class="bookquote">``I have shot the Wendy.
<p/>Peter will be so pleased with me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Overhead Tinker Bell shouted <div class="bookquote">``Silly ass!''  (<font color='red'><b>Overhead Tinker Bell</b></font>)</div>and darted into hiding. The others did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>They had crowded round Wendy, and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. If Wendy's heart had been beating they would all have heard it.
<p/>Slightly was the first to speak. '' This is no bird,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) said in a scared voice. '' I think this must be a lady.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``A lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Tootles, and fell a-trembling. '' And we have killed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),'' Nibs said hoarsely. They all whipped off their caps.
<p/>'' Now I see,'' Curly said: <div class="bookquote">``Peter was bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Curly</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) threw himself sorrowfully on the ground. '' A lady to take care of us at last,'' said one of the twins, <div class="bookquote">``and you have killed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)!
<p/>They were sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), but sorrier for themselves, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) took a step nearer them they turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the twins</b></font>)</div>Tootles' face was very white, but there was a dignity about him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) now that had never been there before. ''
<p/>I did it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, reflecting. '' When ladies used to come to me in dreams, I said, `Pretty mother, pretty mother.'
<p/>But when at last she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) really came, I shot her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) moved slowly away. '' Don't go,'' they called in pity.
<p/>It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of every one of them rise to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>'' I must,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) answered, shaking; <div class="bookquote">``I am so afraid of Peter. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They heard Peter crow. '' Peter! '' they cried, for it was always thus that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) signalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) return.
<p/>'' Hide her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),'' they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy. But Tootles stood aloof. Again came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them.
<p/>'' Greetings, boys,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried, and mechanically they saluted, and then again was silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) frowned. '' I am back,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said hotly, <div class="bookquote">``why do you not cheer?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) overlooked it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) haste to tell the glorious tidings.
<p/>'' Great news, boys,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I have brought at last a mother for you all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Still no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) dropped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) knees.
<p/>'' Have you not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? '' asked Peter, becoming troubled. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) flew this way.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>one voice said, and another said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, mournful day.
<p/>Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``I will show her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and when the others would still have hidden her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Back, twins, let Peter see.
<p/>So they all stood back, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) see, and after he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had looked for a little time he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did not know what to do next.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Tootles rose. '' '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is dead,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said uncomfortably. '' Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is frightened at being dead. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was out of sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and then never going near the spot any more.
<p/>They would all have been glad to follow if he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had done this. But there was the arrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart and faced his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) band.
<p/>'' Whose arrow?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) demanded sternly. '' Mine, Peter,'' said Tootles on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) knees. '' Oh, dastard hand,'' Peter said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) raised the arrow to use it as a dagger.
<p/>Tootles did not flinch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) bared his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) breast. '' Strike, Peter,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said firmly, <div class="bookquote">``strike true. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Twice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hand fall.
<p/>'' I cannot strike,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said with awe, <div class="bookquote">``there is something stays my hand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>All looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked at Wendy.
<p/>'' It is she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``the Wendy lady, see, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arm!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Wonderful to relate -LSB-tell-RSB-, Wendy had raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arm.
<p/>Nibs bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and listened reverently. '' I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, `Poor Tootles,''' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) whispered. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lives,'' Peter said briefly.
<p/>Slightly cried instantly, <div class="bookquote">``The Wendy lady lives. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Then Peter knelt beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) button. You remember she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had put it on a chain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wore round her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) neck.
<p/>'' See,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the arrow struck against this. It is the kiss I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). It has saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember kisses,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Slightly interposed quickly, <div class="bookquote">``let me see it. Ay, that's a kiss. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Peter did not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was begging Wendy to get better quickly, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could show her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) the mermaids.
<p/>Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could not answer yet, being still in a frightful faint; but from overhead came a wailing note. <div class="bookquote">``Listen to Tink,''  (<font color='red'><b>Curly</b></font>)</div>said Curly, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) is crying because the Wendy lives.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Curly</b></font>)</div>Then they had to tell Peter of Tink's crime, and almost never had they seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) look so stern. <div class="bookquote">``Listen, Tinker Bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) cried, ``I am your friend no more.
<p/>Not until Wendy again raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arm did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) relent sufficiently to say, <div class="bookquote">``Well, not for ever, but for a whole week.
<p/>Begone from me for ever.

'' Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arm?
<p/>Oh dear no, never wanted to pinch her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) so much. Fairies indeed are strange, and Peter, who understood them best, often cuffed

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Peter said, <div class="bookquote">``you must not touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That,'' said Slightly, <div class="bookquote">``is what I was thinking.''  (<font color='red'><b>Slightly</b></font>)</div>'' But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lies there,'' Tootles said, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) will die.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tootles</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) will die,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Slightly admitted, <div class="bookquote">``but there is no way out.''

<p/>'' John, John,'' Michael would cry, <div class="bookquote">``wake up! Where is Nana, John, and mother? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div>And then John would rub his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes and mutter,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true, we did fly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter. '' Hullo, Peter,'' they said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) feet to see how large a house she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would need.
<p/>'' Hullo,'' replied Peter amicably, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had quite forgotten them. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) meant to leave room for chairs and a table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div>Michael proposed, <div class="bookquote">``let us wake her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and get her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) to make supper for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div>but as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house.
<p/>John and Michael watched him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). '' Is Wendy asleep? '' they asked. '' Yes.'' '' Look at them! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cried.

<p/>'' Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) is only a girl!'' '' That,'' explained Curly, <div class="bookquote">``is why we are her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) servants. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Curly</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You? Wendy's servants!''

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Peter thought of everything.

'' Please, sir,'' said Peter, going to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``are you a doctor?
<p/>The difference between him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) and the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was make-believe, while to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) make-believe and true were exactly the same thing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>This sometimes troubled them, as when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners. If they broke down in their make-believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) rapped them on the knuckles.
<p/>'' Yes, my little man,'' Slightly anxiously replied, who had chapped knuckles. '' Please, sir,'' Peter explained, <div class="bookquote">``a lady lies very ill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In yonder glade. It was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>How is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)? '' inquired Peter.

<p/>In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy's feet.
<p/>'' Tut, tut, tut,'' said Slightly, <div class="bookquote">``this has cured her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).''

<p/>``I wish I had a pretty house, The littlest ever seen, With funny little red walls And roof of mossy green.
<p/>They gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the branches they had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground was carpeted with moss.
<p/>As they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves: <div class="bookquote">``We've built the little walls and roof And made a lovely door, So tell us, mother Wendy, What are you wanting more?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>To this she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) answered greedily: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, really next I think I'll have Gay windows all about, With roses peeping in, you know, And babies peeping out.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Immediately, without opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) eyes, Wendy began to sing: '' '' With a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves were the blinds.
<p/>To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again: <div class="bookquote">``We've made the roses peeping out, The babes are at the door, We cannot make ourselves, you know, `cos we've been made before.
<p/>But roses--? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter babies</b></font>)</div>Roses,'' cried Peter sternly. Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls. Babies? '' Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) own.
<p/>The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within, though, of course, they could no longer see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>Peter strode up and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) eagle eyes. Just when it seemed absolutely finished: <div class="bookquote">``There's no knocker on the door,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said.
<p/>They were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) shoe, and it made an excellent knocker. Absolutely finished now, they thought.
<p/>Not of bit of it. '' There's no chimney,'' Peter said; <div class="bookquote">``we must have a chimney.''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It certainly does need a chimney,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>said John importantly.
<p/>This gave Peter an idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) snatched the hat off John's head, knocked out the bottom -LSB-top-RSB-, and put the hat on the roof.
<p/>The little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke immediately began to come out of the hat.
<p/>Now really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but to knock. '' All look your best,'' Peter warned them; <div class="bookquote">``first impressions are awfully important.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a branch and openly sneering.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) was glad no one asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) what first impressions are; they were all too busy looking their best. What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock?
<p/>If a lady, what would she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) be like? The door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off their hats.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would look. '' Where am I? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said.
<p/>Of course Slightly was the first to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) word in. '' Wendy lady,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) said rapidly, <div class="bookquote">``for you we built this house.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh, say you're pleased,'' cried Nibs. '' Lovely, darling house,'' Wendy said, and they were the very words they had hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would say.
<p/>'' And we are your children,'' cried the twins. Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, <div class="bookquote">``O Wendy lady, be our mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Ought I?'' Wendy said, all shining. '' Of course it's frightfully fascinating, but you see I am only a little girl.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That doesn't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) were the only person present who knew all about it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was really the one who knew least.
<p/>I have no real experience. '' '' What we need is just a nice motherly person. '' '' Oh dear!'' Wendy said, <div class="bookquote">``you see, I feel that is exactly what I am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they all cried; <div class="bookquote">``we saw it at once. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I will do my best.
<p/>Come inside at once, you naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you to bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.
<p/>In they went; I don't know how there was room for them, but you can squeeze very tight in the Neverland.
<p/>By and by she (<font color='blue'><b>Cinderella</b></font>) tucked them up in the great bed in the home under the trees, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cinderella</b></font>) herself slept that night in the little house, and Peter kept watch outside with drawn sword, for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl.
<p/>The little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness, with a bright light showing through its blinds, and the chimney smoking beautifully, and Peter standing on guard.
<p/>After a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) fell asleep, and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) on their way home from an orgy.
<p/>Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked Peter's nose and passed on.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And that was the first of the many joyous evenings they had with Wendy. Chapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND
<p/>Hook, you remember, had sneered at the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size.
<p/>Once you fitted, you drew in -LSB-let out-RSB- your breath at the top, and down you went at exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately, and so wriggled up.
<p/>Of course, when you have mastered the action you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and nothing can be more graceful.
<p/>But you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as carefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the clothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree.
<p/>Usually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments or too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and after that you fit.
<p/>Once you fit, great care must be taken to go on fitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) delight, keeps a whole family in perfect condition.
<p/>One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John and Michael for hollow trees. Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to be altered a little.
<p/>After a few days' practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground; especially Wendy.
<p/>It consisted of one large room, as all houses should do, with a floor in which you could dig -LSB-for worms-RSB- if you wanted to go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools.
<p/>A Never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through, level with the floor.
<p/>By tea-time it was always about two feet high, and then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table; as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus there was more room to play.
<p/>There was an enormous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across this Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) suspended her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) washing.
<p/>The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down at 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in it, except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin.
<p/>Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have -LSB-desired-RSB- a baby, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the short and long of it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was hung up in a basket.
<p/>It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances.
<p/>But there was one recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of Tinker Bell.
<p/>It could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious -LSB-particular-RSB-, always kept drawn when dressing or undressing.
<p/>There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned at once. No woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir -LSB-dressing room-RSB- and bed-chamber combined.
<p/>The couch, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in season.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs the best -LRB-the early-RRB- period of Margery and Robin.
<p/>Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps inevitable, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margery</b></font>) chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.
<p/>I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those rampagious boys of hers gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) so much to do.
<p/>There was a chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lit the residence herself. Really there were whole weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was never above ground.
<p/>The cooking, I can tell you, kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) nose to the pot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same.
<p/>You never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter's whim: he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could eat, really eat, if it was part of a game, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could not stodge -LSB-cram down the food-RSB- just to feel stodgy -LSB-stuffed with food-RSB-, which is what most children like better than anything else; the next best thing being to talk about it.
<p/>Of course it was trying, but you simply had to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) lead, and if you could prove to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) that you were getting loose for your tree
<p/>Make-believe was so real to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) that during a meal of it you could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) getting rounder. he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) let you stodge.
<p/>Then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) expressed it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had a breathing time for herself; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) occupied it in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a hole in it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would fling up her (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) arms and exclaim, <div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, I am sure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Wendy's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face beamed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) exclaimed this.
<p/>Well, it very soon discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had come to the island and it found her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) out, and they just ran into each other's arms.
<p/>You remember about her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) pet wolf. After that it followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) about everywhere. As time wore on did she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) think much about the beloved parents she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had left behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)?
<p/>This is a difficult question, because it is quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland.
<p/>But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry about her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) father and mother; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was absolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) to fly back by, and this gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) complete ease of mind.
<p/>What did disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) at times was that John remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) parents vaguely only, as people he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had once known, while Michael was quite willing to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was really his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) mother.
<p/>These things scared her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) a little, and nobly anxious to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) duty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination papers on it, as like as possible to the ones she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) used to do at school.
<p/>The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table, writing and thinking hard about the questions she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had written on another slate and passed round.
<p/>They were the most ordinary questions--<div class="bookquote">``What was the colour of Mother's eyes? Which was taller, Father or Mother? Was Mother blonde or brunette?
<p/>-LRB-A-RRB- Write an essay of not less than 40 words on How I spent my last Holidays, or The Characters of Father and Mother compared.
<p/>Answer all three questions if possible.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Only one of these to be attempted. '' Or ''-LRB-1-RRB- Describe Mother's laugh; -LRB-2-RRB- Describe Father's laugh;
<p/>They were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not answer them you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful what a number of crosses even John made.
<p/>Of course the only boy who replied to every question was Slightly, and no one could have been more hopeful of coming out first, but his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) answers were perfectly ridiculous, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) really came out last: a melancholy thing.
<p/>For one thing he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) despised all mothers except Wendy, and for another he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was the only boy on the island who could neither write nor spell; not the smallest word.
<p/>-LRB-3-RRB- Describe Mother's Party Dress ; -LRB-4-RRB- Describe the Kennel and its Inmate. '' Peter did not compete. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was above all that sort of thing.
<p/>By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What was the colour of Mother's eyes, and so on.
<p/>Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but about this time Peter invented, with Wendy's help, a new game that fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) enormously, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) games.
<p/>It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly.
<p/>To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit
<p/>Wendy, you see, had been forgetting, too. still seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) such a comic thing to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) boasted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had gone walking for the good of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) health.
<p/>For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>); and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would have treated them severely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) often went out alone, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) came back you were never absolutely certain whether he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had had an adventure or not.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) might have forgotten it so completely that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said nothing about it; and then when you went out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) might say a great deal about it, and yet you could not find the body.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) came home with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) told a dazzling tale.
<p/>There were, however, many adventures which she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knew to be true because she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was in them herself, and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and said they were wholly true.
<p/>To describe them all would require a book as large as an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was never quite sure, you know. The difficulty is which one to choose. Should we take the brush with the redskins at Slightly Gulch?
<p/>It was a sanguinary affair, and especially interesting as showing one of Peter's peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would suddenly change sides.
<p/>At the Gulch, when victory was still in the balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) called out, <div class="bookquote">``I'm redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?
<p/>and so on; and they were all redskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by Peter's methods, agreed to be lost boys for that once, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever.
<p/>The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was--but we have not decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate.
<p/>Perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And Tootles answered, <div class="bookquote">``Redskin; what are you, Nibs? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and Nibs said, <div class="bookquote">``Redskin; what are you Twin? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily's life in the Mermaids' Lagoon, and so made her (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) ally.
<p/>Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) children, so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.
<p/>Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter's friends, particularly of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how the nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) eggs, and Peter gave orders that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was not to be disturbed.
<p/>That is a pretty story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just one.
<p/>A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell's attempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland.
<p/>Or again, we might choose Peter's defiance of the lions, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) drew a circle round him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) challenge.
<p/>Fortunately the leaf gave way and Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Which of these adventures shall we choose?
<p/>The best way will be to toss for it. I have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that the gulch or the cake or Tink's leaf had won.
<p/>Of course I could do it again, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon.
<p/>If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire.
<p/>This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing.
<p/>The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth.
<p/>You must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy's lasting regrets that all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was on the island she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) never had a civil word from one of them.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stole softly to the edge of the lagoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) might see them by the score, especially on Marooners' Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>); or she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and dived, probably splashing her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.
<p/>They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who chatted with them on Marooners' Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails when they got cheeky.
<p/>Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) gave Wendy one of their combs.
<p/>The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), than because she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles.
<p/>The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst.
<p/>Sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight.
<p/>The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the keepers only are allowed to use their hands. But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared.
<p/>Nevertheless we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted it.
<p/>It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal.
<p/>This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland. Wendy insisted on their doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe.
<p/>So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened in it, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sat beside them and looked important.
<p/>The rock was not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking.
<p/>It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners' Rock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was very busy, stitching. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stitched a change came to the lagoon.
<p/>Wendy could no longer see to thread her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) needle, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) looked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly.
<p/>Little shivers ran over it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning it cold. It was not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night had come.
<p/>No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming.
<p/>There crowded upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) all the stories she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had been told of Marooners' Rock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them there to drown.
<p/>Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) should have roused the children at once; not merely because of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly.
<p/>What was it? They drown when the tide rises, for then it is submerged. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was a young mother and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did not know this
<p/>; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought you simply must stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. So, though fear was upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) longed to hear male voices, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would not waken them.
<p/>Even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) heard the sound of muffled oars, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) heart was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mouth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did not waken them.
<p/>It was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could sniff danger even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sleep.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) stood over them to let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy? Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at once as a dog, and with one warning cry he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) roused the others.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) stood motionless, one hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) ear. <div class="bookquote">``Pirates! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried. The others came closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). A strange smile was playing about his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered.
<p/>While that smile was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) face no one dared address him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>); all they could do was to stand ready to obey.
<p/>The order came sharp and incisive. <div class="bookquote">``Dive!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted. Marooners' Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were itself marooned.
<p/>It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger Lily.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) race more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the happy hunting-ground?
<p/>Yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face was impassive; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was the daughter of a chief, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) must die as a chief's daughter, it is enough.
<p/>The boat drew nearer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hands and ankles were tied, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knew what was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fate. They had caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>No watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook's boast that the wind of his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) name guarded the ship for a mile around.
<p/>Now her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fate would help to guard it also. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.
<p/>In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the rock till they crashed into it.
<p/>Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) here to drown.
<p/>It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was too proud to offer a vain resistance.
<p/>'' Luff, you lubber,'' cried an Irish voice that was Smee's; <div class="bookquote">``here's the rock. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Smee</b></font>)</div>Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and down, Peter's and Wendy's.
<p/>Wendy was crying, for it was the first tragedy she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had forgotten them all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was two against one that angered him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) meant to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>).
<p/>An easy way would have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was never one to choose the easy way.
<p/>There was almost nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could not do, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) now imitated the voice of Hook. '' Ahoy there, you lubbers!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) called. It was a marvellous imitation. '' The captain!'' said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) must be swimming out to us,'' Starkey said, when they had looked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) in vain. '' We are putting the redskin on the rock,'' Smee called out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Set her (<font color='blue'><b>redskin</b></font>) free,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came the astonishing answer. '' Free!'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, cut her (<font color='blue'><b>redskin</b></font>) bonds and let her (<font color='blue'><b>redskin</b></font>) go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>captain</b></font>)</div>'' But, captain--'' <div class="bookquote">``At once, d'ye hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>captain</b></font>)</div>cried Peter, <div class="bookquote">``or I'll plunge my hook in you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/>'' This is queer!'' Smee gasped. '' Better do what the captain orders,'' said Starkey nervously. '' Ay, ay,'' Smee said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) cut Tiger Lily's cords.
<p/>Of course Wendy was very elated over Peter's cleverness; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray himself, so at once her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand went out to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>At once like an eel she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) slid between Starkey's legs into the water. But it was stayed even in the act, for <div class="bookquote">``Boat ahoy!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>rang over the lagoon in Hook's voice, and this time it was not Peter who had spoken. Peter may have been about to crow, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) face puckered in a whistle of surprise instead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was swimming to the boat, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) men showed a light to guide him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had soon reached them.
<p/>In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hook grip the boat's side; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) evil swarthy face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) rose dripping from the water, and, quaking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would have liked to swim away, but Peter would not budge.
<p/>'' Boat ahoy!'' again came the voice. Now Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was tingling with life and also top-heavy with conceit.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought so also, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was really glad for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) reputation that no one heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) except herself.
<p/>The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain to them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hook in a position of profound melancholy.
<p/>'' Am I not a wonder, oh, I am a wonder! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) signed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) to listen. '' Captain, is all well?
<p/>'' they asked timidly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) answered with a hollow moan. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) sighs,'' said Smee. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) sighs again,'' said Starkey.
<p/>'' And yet a third time he (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) sighs,'' said Smee. Then at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) spoke passionately. '' The game's up,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``those boys have found a mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Affrighted though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was, Wendy swelled with pride. '' O evil day!'' cried Starkey. '' What's a mother?'' asked the ignorant Smee.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) doesn't know!'' and always after this she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee would be her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) one.
<p/>Wendy was so shocked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) exclaimed. '' Peter pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying, <div class="bookquote">``What was that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Starkey</b></font>)</div>said Starkey, raising the lantern over the waters, and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight.
<p/>It was the nest I have told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was sitting on it.
<p/>'' See,'' said Hook in answer to Smee's question, ``that is a mother. What a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the mother desert her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eggs?
<p/>There was a break in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) voice, as if for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) recalled innocent days when--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) brushed away this weakness with his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) hook.
<p/>Smee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but the more suspicious Starkey said, <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is a mother, perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is hanging about here to help Peter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Starkey</b></font>)</div><p/>No. '' Hook winced. '' Ay,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that is the fear that haunts me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was roused from this dejection by Smee's eager voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smee</b></font>)</div>said Smee, <div class="bookquote">``could we not kidnap these boys' mother and make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) our mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Smee</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is a princely scheme,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Hook, and at once it took practical shape in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) great brain.
<p/>We will seize the children and carry them to the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our mother.
<p/>'' '' Again Wendy forgot herself. '' Never! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cried, and bobbed. '' What was that? '' But they could see nothing.
<p/>They thought it must have been a leaf in the wind. '' Do you agree, my bullies? '' asked Hook. ''
<p/>There is my hand on it,'' they both said. '' And there is my hook. Swear. '' They all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hook remembered Tiger Lily.
<p/>'' Where is the redskin? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) demanded abruptly. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was one of the moments.
<p/>'' That is all right, captain,'' Smee answered complacently; <div class="bookquote">``we let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Smee</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) go!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Hook. '' 'Twas your own orders,'' the bo`sun faltered.
<p/>'' You called over the water to us to let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) go,'' said Starkey. '' Brimstone and gall,'' thundered Hook, <div class="bookquote">``what cozening -LSB-cheating-RSB- is going on here!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) face had gone black with rage, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) saw that they believed their words, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) was startled. ''
<p/>Lads,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) said, shaking a little, <div class="bookquote">``I gave no such order. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is passing queer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smee</b></font>)</div>Smee said, and they all fidgeted uncomfortably.
<p/>Hook raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) voice, but there was a quiver in it. '' Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``dost hear me?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Of course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) immediately answered in Hook's voice: <div class="bookquote">``Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you.
<p/>In that supreme moment Hook did not blanch, even at the gills, but Smee and Starkey clung to each other in terror.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' Who are you, stranger? Speak!'' Hook demanded. '' I am James Hook,'' replied the voice, <div class="bookquote">``captain of the JOLLY ROGER.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Hook/James Hook</b></font>)</div>'' You are not; you are not,'' Hook cried hoarsely. '' Brimstone and gall,'' the voice retorted, <div class="bookquote">``say that again, and I'll cast anchor in you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Hook tried a more ingratiating manner. '' If you are Hook,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) said almost humbly, <div class="bookquote">``come tell me, who am I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' A codfish,'' replied the voice, <div class="bookquote">``only a codfish.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' A codfish!'' Hook echoed blankly, and it was then, but not till then, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) proud spirit broke.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) men draw back from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>). '' Have we been captained all this time by a codfish! '' they muttered.
<p/>'' It is lowering to our pride. '' They were his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) dogs snapping at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>), but, tragic figure though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) had become, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) scarcely heeded them.
<p/>Against such fearful evidence it was not their belief in him (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) needed, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) ego slipping from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>).
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the great pirates, and it sometimes gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) intuitions.
<p/>'' Don't desert me, bully,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) whispered hoarsely to it. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) tried the guessing game. '' Hook,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) called, <div class="bookquote">``have you another voice?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Now Peter could never resist a game, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) answered blithely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) own voice, <div class="bookquote">``I have.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And another name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Vegetable? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Hook. '' No.'' <div class="bookquote">``Mineral?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No.'' <div class="bookquote">``Animal?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Man?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This answer rang out scornfully. ''
<p/>Boy?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ordinary boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wonderful boy? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>To Wendy's pain the answer that rang out this time was <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you in England?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No.'' <div class="bookquote">``Are you here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hook was completely puzzled. '' You ask him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) some questions,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said to the others, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) damp brow.
<p/>Smee reflected. '' I can't think of a thing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) said regretfully. '' Can't guess, can't guess!'' crowed Peter. '' Do you give it up?
<p/>'' Of course in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) pride he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was carrying the game too far, and the miscreants -LSB-villains-RSB- saw their chance. ''
<p/>Yes, yes,'' they answered eagerly. '' Well, then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I am Peter Pan. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Pan! In a moment Hook was himself again, and Smee and Starkey were his (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) faithful henchmen.
<p/>'' Now we have him (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>),'' Hook shouted. '' Into the water, Smee. Starkey, mind the boat. Take him (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) dead or alive!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) leaped as he (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of Peter. '' Are you ready, boys?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from various parts of the lagoon.
<p/>'' Then lam into the pirates. '' The fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who gallantly climbed into the boat and held Starkey.
<p/>There was fierce struggle, in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate's grasp. He (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) wriggled overboard and John leapt after him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of steel followed by a cry or a whoop.
<p/>The dinghy drifted away. In the confusion some struck at their own side. The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) was himself pinked -LSB-nicked-RSB- in turn by Curly.
<p/>Farther from the rock Starkey was pressing Slightly and the twins hard. Where all this time was Peter? He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was seeking bigger game.
<p/>The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing from the pirate captain. His (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) iron claw made a circle of dead water round him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), from which they fled like affrighted fishes.
<p/>But there was one who did not fear him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>): there was one prepared to enter that circle. Strangely, it was not in the water that they met.
<p/>Hook rose to the rock to breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite side. The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather than climb.
<p/>Each feeling for a grip met the other's arm: in surprise they raised their heads; their faces were almost touching; so they met.
<p/>Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to -LSB-began combat-RSB- they had a sinking -LSB-feeling in the stomach-RSB-.
<p/>Neither knew that the other was coming. Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would admit it. After all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared.
<p/>Quick as thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) snatched a knife from Hook's belt and was about to drive it home, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was higher up the rock than his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) foe.
<p/>But Peter had no sinking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had one feeling only, gladness; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) gnashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) pretty teeth with joy. It would not have been fighting fair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) gave the pirate a hand to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) up. It was then that Hook bit him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter.
<p/>It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) quite helpless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could only stare, horrified. Every child is affected thus the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) is treated unfairly.
<p/>After you have been unfair to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) will love you again, but will never afterwards be quite the same boy.
<p/>All he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has a right to when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) comes to you to be yours is fairness. No one ever gets over the first unfairness; no one except Peter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) often met it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) always forgot it. I suppose that was the real difference between him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) and all the rest.
<p/>So when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) met it now it was like the first time; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could just stare, helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>A few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking wildly for the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white fear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>On ordinary occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but now they were uneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and were scouring the lagoon for them, calling them by name.
<p/>They found the dinghy and went home in it, shouting <div class="bookquote">``Peter, Wendy''  (<font color='red'><b>the mermaids</b></font>)</div>as they went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids.
<p/>'' They must be swimming back or flying,'' the boys concluded. They were not very anxious, because they had such faith in Peter.
<p/>They chuckled, boylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy's fault! When their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and then a feeble cry.
<p/>'' Help, help! '' Two small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted and lay on the boy's arm.
<p/>With a last effort Peter pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) up the rock and then lay down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) also fainted he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) saw that the water was rising.
<p/>As they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) softly into the water.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) knew that they would soon be drowned, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could do no more. Peter, feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) slip from him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), woke with a start, and was just in time to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) back.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) the truth. '' We are on the rock, Wendy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but it is growing smaller.
<p/>Soon the water will be over it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did not understand even now. '' We must go,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, almost brightly.
<p/>'' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) answered faintly. '' Shall we swim or fly, Peter? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>). '' Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy, without my help?
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was too tired. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) moaned. '' What is it? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked, anxious about him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) at once.
<p/>'' I can't help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly nor swim. '' <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean we shall both be drowned?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look how the water is rising. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They thought they would soon be no more.
<p/>As they sat thus something brushed against Peter as light as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying timidly, <div class="bookquote">``Can I be of any use?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>It was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before. It had torn itself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) hand and floated away.
<p/>Michael's kite,'' Peter said without interest, but next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>'' '' It lifted Michael off the ground,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``why should it not carry you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Both of us!'' <div class="bookquote">``It can't lift two; Michael and Curly tried.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us draw lots,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>Wendy said bravely. '' And you a lady; never. '' Already he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had tied the tail round her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) refused to go without him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>); but with a <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Wendy,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) from the rock; and in a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was borne out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) sight.
<p/>Pale rays of light tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world:
<p/>Peter was alone on the lagoon. The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. the mermaids calling to the moon.
<p/>A tremour ran through him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), like a shudder passing over the sea; but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them, and Peter felt just the one.
<p/>Next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) face and a drum beating within him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>Peter was not quite like other boys; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was afraid at last. It was saying, <div class="bookquote">``To die will be an awfully big adventure.
<p/>The last sound Peter heard before he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was quite alone were the mermaids retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was too far away to hear their doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes -LRB-as in all the nicest houses on the mainland-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) heard the bells.
<p/>Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) feet; and to pass the time until they made their final gulp, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) watched the only thing on the lagoon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thought it was a piece of floating paper, perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to drift ashore.
<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide, and sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to the weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of paper.
<p/>It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making desperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest.
<p/>By working her (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) wings, in a way she (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had learned since the nest fell into the water, she (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was able to some extent to guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) strange craft, but by the time Peter recognised her (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Chapter 9 THE NEVER BIRD she (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was very exhausted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had come to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) nest, though there were eggs in it.
<p/>I can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling and the rest of them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was melted because he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had all his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) first teeth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) called out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had come for, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) called out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was doing there; but of course neither of them understood the other's language.
<p/>In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a story, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened.
<p/>I rather wonder at the bird, for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had been nice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had also sometimes tormented her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>). Well, not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their manners.
<p/>'' I--want--you--to--get--into--the--nest,'' the bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible, <div class="bookquote">``and --then--you--can--drift--ashore, but-- I--am--too--tired--to--bring--it--any--nearer-- so--you--must--try to--swim--to--it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' What are you quacking about?''
<p/>Peter answered. '' Why don't you let the nest drift as usual?'' '' I--want-- you-- '' the bird said, and repeated it all over.
<p/>Then Peter tried slow and distinct. '' What--are--you--quacking--about?'' and so on. The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.
<p/>'' You dunderheaded little jay!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) screamed, <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you do as I tell you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Peter felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) names, and at a venture he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) retorted hotly:
<p/>Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could, and by one last mighty effort she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) propelled the nest against the rock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So are you!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark: <div class="bookquote">``Shut up!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shut up!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then up she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) flew; deserting her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eggs, so as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) meaning clear.
<p/>It was not to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thanks, however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) get into the nest; it was to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did with her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eggs.
<p/>Then at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) understood, and clutched the nest and waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thanks to the bird as she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) fluttered overhead. There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected.
<p/>The bird covered her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wings, so as not to see the last of them; but she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could not help peeping between the feathers.
<p/>I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock, driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure.
<p/>The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon them.
<p/>The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim.
<p/>The Never bird saw at once what he (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) was up to, and screamed her (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) admiration of him (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>); and, alas, Peter crowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) agreement with her (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>).
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) shirt for a sail.
<p/>Peter put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon. It floated beautifully. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) eggs.
<p/>Of course when Peter landed he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) beached his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) barque -LSB-small ship, actually the Never Bird's nest in this particular case in point-RSB- in a place where the bird would easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that she (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) abandoned the nest.
<p/>It drifted about till it went to pieces, and often Starkey came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sitting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) hat.
<p/>As we shall not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) again, it may be worth mentioning here that all Never birds now build in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an airing.
<p/>Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite.
<p/>Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed.
<p/>This so inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, <div class="bookquote">``To bed, to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>in a voice that had to be obeyed.
<p/>Next day, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to every one, and they played till bed-time at limping about and carrying their arms in slings.
<p/>Chapter 10 THE HAPPY HOME One important result of the brush -LSB-with the pirates-RSB- on the lagoon was that it made the redskins their friends.
<p/>Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now there was nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) braves would not do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed.
<p/>Even by day they hung about, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bits to eat.
<p/>They called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves -LSB-lying down-RSB- before him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) liked this tremendously, so that it was not really good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>The great white father,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would say to them in a very lordly manner, as they grovelled at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feet, <div class="bookquote">``is glad to see the Piccaninny warriors protecting his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wigwam from the pirates.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) drifted in one direction, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was borne off in another, both cheering. '' <div class="bookquote">``Me Tiger Lily,''  (<font color='red'><b>creature</b></font>)</div>that lovely creature would reply.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) due, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would answer condescendingly, <div class="bookquote">``It is good.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Peter Pan save me, me his (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>). '' Peter Pan has spoken.
<p/>Always when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Peter Pan has spoken,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>it meant that they must now shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were by no means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as just ordinary braves.
<p/>They said <div class="bookquote">``How-do?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>to them, and things like that; and what annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all right.
<p/>Secretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was far too loyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father.
<p/>'' '' Father knows best,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) always said, whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) private opinion must be. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) private opinion was that the redskins should not call her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) a squaw.
<p/>We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the Night of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot.
<p/>The day, as if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the redskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below, the children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time.
<p/>The way you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay near him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) till the clock struck.
<p/>The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and recriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening.
<p/>To be sure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did not mind noise, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) simply would not have them grabbing things, and then excusing themselves by saying that Tootles had pushed their elbow.
<p/>There was a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by raising the right arm politely and saying, <div class="bookquote">``I complain of so-and-so;''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>but what usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had told them that they were not all to speak at once.
<p/>'' Is your mug empty, Slightly darling?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not quite empty, mummy,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Slightly said, after looking into an imaginary mug. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>so-and-so</b></font>) hasn't even begun to drink his (<font color='blue'><b>so-and-so</b></font>) milk,'' Nibs interposed.
<p/>This was telling, and Slightly seized his (<font color='blue'><b>so-and-so</b></font>) chance. '' I complain of Nibs,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>so-and-so</b></font>) cried promptly. John, however, had held up his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hand first.
<p/>'' Well, John?'' <div class="bookquote">``May I sit in Peter's chair, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) is not here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sit in father's chair, John!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>Wendy was scandalised.
<p/>'' Certainly not. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is not really our father,'' John answered. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) didn't even know how a father does till I showed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was so much the humblest of them, indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was the only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>'' This was grumbling. '' We complain of John,'' cried the twins. Tootles held up his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hand. '' I don't suppose,'' Tootles said diffidently -LSB-bashfully or timidly-RSB-, <div class="bookquote">``that I could be father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, Tootles. '' Once Tootles began, which was not very often, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a silly way of going on. ''
<p/>As I can't be father,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said heavily, <div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose, Michael, you would let me be baby?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' No, I won't,'' Michael rapped out.
<p/>As I can't be baby,'' Tootles said, getting heavier and heavier and heavier, <div class="bookquote">``do you think I could be a twin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>baby</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was already in his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) basket. '' '' No, indeed,'' replied the twins; <div class="bookquote">``it's awfully difficult to be a twin.''  (<font color='red'><b>the twins</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>As I can't be anything important,'' said Tootles, <div class="bookquote">``would any of you like to see me do a trick?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tootles</b></font>)</div>'' No,'' they all replied.
<p/>Then at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) stopped. '' I hadn't really any hope,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) said. The hateful telling broke out again. '' Slightly is coughing on the table.''
<p/>'' The twins began with cheese-cakes.'' '' Curly is taking both butter and honey. '' '' Nibs is speaking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) mouth full.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I complain of the twins. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I complain of Curly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I complain of Nibs.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>'' Oh dear, oh dear ,'' cried Wendy, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I sometimes think that spinsters are to be envied.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) told them to clear away, and sat down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) work-basket, a heavy load of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>'' Wendy,'' remonstrated -LSB-scolded-RSB- Michael, <div class="bookquote">``I'm too big for a cradle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must have somebody in a cradle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said almost tartly, <div class="bookquote">``and you are the littlest.
<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sewed they played around her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>); such a group of happy faces and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire.
<p/>It had become a very familiar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but we are looking on it for the last time.
<p/>A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a house. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to recognize it.
<p/>'' Children, I hear your father's step. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) likes you to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at the door. '' Above, the redskins crouched before Peter.
<p/>'' Watch well, braves. I have spoken. '' And then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) tree.
<p/>As so often before, but never again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for Wendy.
<p/>'' Peter, you just spoil them, you know,'' Wendy simpered -LSB-exaggerated a smile-RSB-. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, old lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, hanging up his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) gun.
<p/>'' It was me told him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mothers are called old lady,'' Michael whispered to Curly. '' I complain of Michael,'' said Curly instantly.
<p/>The first twin came to Peter. '' Father, we want to dance.'' <div class="bookquote">``Dance away, my little man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, who was in high good humour.
<p/>'' But we want you to dance. '' Peter was really the best dancer among them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) pretended to be scandalised.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me! My old bones would rattle!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And mummy too.'' <div class="bookquote">``What,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>cried Wendy, <div class="bookquote">``the mother of such an armful, dance!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>It was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for they had long lost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do anything special they said this was Saturday night, and then they did it.
<p/>But on a Saturday night,'' Slightly insinuated. '' Of course it is Saturday night, Peter,'' Wendy said, relenting. '' People of our figure, Wendy!''
<p/>'' But it is only among our own progeny -LSB-children-RSB-. '' <div class="bookquote">``True, true. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties first.
<p/>Ah, old lady,'' Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by the fire and looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) sat turning a heel, <div class="bookquote">``there is nothing more pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day's toil is over than to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' It is sweet, Peter, isn't it?'' Wendy said, frightfully gratified. '' Peter, I think Curly has your nose. ''
<p/>Dear Peter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, ``with such a large family, of course, I have now passed my best, but you don't want to
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Michael takes after you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) shoulder. '' -LSB-ex-RSB-change me, do you?''
<p/>Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) did not want a change, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) uncomfortably, blinking, you know, like one not sure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was awake or asleep.
<p/>'' No, Wendy. '' '' Peter, what is it?'' <div class="bookquote">``I was just thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, a little scared. '' It is only make-believe, isn't it, that I am their father?''
<p/>Oh yes,'' Wendy said primly -LSB-formally and properly-RSB-. <div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``it would make me seem so old to be their real father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.'' '' But not really, Wendy? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) asked anxiously. '' Not if you don't wish it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) replied; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) distinctly heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sigh of relief.
<p/>'' Peter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked, trying to speak firmly, <div class="bookquote">``what are your exact feelings to -LSB-about-RSB- me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Those of a devoted son, Wendy.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, and went and sat by herself at the extreme end of the room. '' You are so queer,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, frankly puzzled, <div class="bookquote">``and Tiger Lily is just the same.
<p/>There is something she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wants to be to me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) says it is not my mother. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' No, indeed, it is not,'' Wendy replied with frightful emphasis.
<p/>Now we know why she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was prejudiced against the redskins. '' Then what is it?'' <div class="bookquote">``It isn't for a lady to tell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh, very well,'' Peter said, a little nettled. '' Perhaps Tinker Bell will tell me.'' '' Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,'' Wendy retorted scornfully.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) is an abandoned little creature. '' Here Tink, who was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out something impudent. ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) glories in being abandoned,'' Peter interpreted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had a sudden idea. '' Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You silly ass! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tinker</b></font>)</div>cried Tinker Bell in a passion. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.
<p/>'' I almost agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>),'' Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had been much tried, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) little knew what was to happen before the night was out.
<p/>Their ignorance gave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on the island, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had known she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would not have snapped. None of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. They sang and danced in their night-gowns.
<p/>Such a deliciously creepy song it was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows, little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them, from whom they would shrink in real fear.
<p/>It was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the pillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may never meet again.
<p/>So uproariously gay was the dance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it! The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy's good-night story!
<p/>Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but the beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others but himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said happily: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is a dull beginning.
<p/>And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy's story, the story they loved best, the story Peter hated.
<p/>Usually when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) began to tell this story he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) left the room or put his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) ears; and possibly if he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had done either of those things this time they might all still be on the island.
<p/>I say, let us pretend that it is the end. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But to-night he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) remained on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) stool; and we shall see what happened.
<p/>Chapter 11 WENDY'S STORY <div class="bookquote">``Listen, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>said Wendy, settling down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) story, with Michael at her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) feet and seven boys in the bed.
<p/>'' There was once a gentleman-- '' <div class="bookquote">``I had rather he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been a lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>Curly said. '' I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Curly</b></font>) had been a white rat,'' said Nibs.
<p/>'' Quiet,'' their mother admonished -LSB-cautioned-RSB- them. '' There was a lady also, and-- '' '' Oh, mummy,'' cried the first twin,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``you mean that there is a lady also, don't you? She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is not dead, is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the twin</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, no. '' <div class="bookquote">``I am awfully glad she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) isn't dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Tootles.
<p/>'' Are you glad, John?'' <div class="bookquote">``Of course I am. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you glad, Nibs?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Rather.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you glad, Twins?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We are glad.
<p/>Little less noise there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Peter called out, determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should have fair play, however beastly a story it might be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) opinion.
<p/>'' '' Oh dear,'' sighed Wendy. '' '' The gentleman's name,'' Wendy continued, <div class="bookquote">``was Mr. Darling, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) name was Mrs. Darling.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I knew them,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>John said, to annoy the others. '' I think I knew them,'' said Michael rather doubtfully. ''
<p/>They were married, you know,'' explained Wendy, <div class="bookquote">``and what do you think they had? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``White rats,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Nibs, inspired. ''
<p/>No.'' '' It's awfully puzzling,'' said Tootles, who knew the story by heart. '' Quiet, Tootles. They had three descendants. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is descendants?''  (<font color='red'><b>Twin</b></font>)</div>'' Well, you are one, Twin.'' <div class="bookquote">``Did you hear that, John? I am a descendant. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Descendants are only children,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>said John.
<p/>Now these three children had a faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) and chained her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.''
<p/>'' Oh dear, oh dear,'' sighed Wendy. '' '' It's an awfully good story,'' said Nibs. '' They flew away,'' Wendy continued, <div class="bookquote">``to the Neverland, where the lost children are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I just thought they did,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Curly broke in excitedly. '' I don't know how it is, but I just thought they did!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Wendy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Tootles, <div class="bookquote">``was one of the lost children called Tootles?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am in a story.
<p/>Hurrah, I am in a story, Nibs.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hush. Now I want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents with all their children flown away.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oo! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the parents</b></font>)</div>they all moaned, though they were not really considering the feelings of the unhappy parents one jot. ''
<p/>Think of the empty beds!'' <div class="bookquote">``Oo!''  (<font color='red'><b>the twin</b></font>)</div>'' It's awfully sad,'' the first twin said cheerfully. '' I don't see how it can have a happy ending,'' said the second twin.
<p/>'' Do you, Nibs?'' '' I'm frightfully anxious.'' <div class="bookquote">``If you knew how great is a mother's love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>Wendy told them triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">``you would have no fear.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had now come to the part that Peter hated. '' I do like a mother's love,'' said Tootles, hitting Nibs with a pillow.
<p/>You see,'' Wendy said complacently, <div class="bookquote">``our heroine knew that the mother would always leave the window open for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) children to fly back by; so they stayed away for years and had a lovely time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Do you like a mother's love, Nibs?'' <div class="bookquote">``I do just,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Nibs, hitting back. '' <div class="bookquote">``Did they ever go back?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>said Wendy, bracing herself up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) finest effort, <div class="bookquote">``take a peep into the future;''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>and they all gave themselves the twist that makes peeps into the future easier.
<p/>'' Years have rolled by, and who is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station?'' <div class="bookquote">``O Wendy, who is she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried Nibs, every bit as excited as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) didn't know. '' Can it be--yes--no-- it is--the fair Wendy!'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), now grown to man's estate? Can they be John and Michael?
<p/>They are!'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>brothers</b></font>)</div>''`See, dear brothers,' says Wendy pointing upwards, `there is the window still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our sublime faith in a mother's love.'
<p/>So up they flew to their mummy and daddy, and pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which we draw a veil.
<p/>'' That was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair narrator herself. Everything just as it should be, you see.
<p/>Off we skip like the most heartless things in the world, which is what children are, but so attractive; and we have an entirely selfish time, and then when we have need of special attention we nobly return for it, confident that we shall be rewarded instead of smacked.
<p/>So great indeed was their faith in a mother's love that they felt they could afford to be callous for a bit longer.
<p/>But there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) uttered a hollow groan. '' What is it, Peter?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cried, running to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was ill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) felt him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) solicitously, lower down than his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) chest. '' Where is it, Peter?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't that kind of pain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Peter replied darkly. '' Then what kind is it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Wendy, you are wrong about mothers.
<p/>They all gathered round him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) in affright, so alarming was his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) agitation; and with a fine candour he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) told them what he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had hitherto concealed.
<p/>Long ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I thought like you that my mother would always keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and moons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had forgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my bed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' I am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it scared them.
<p/>Still it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) should give in.
<p/>'' Are you sure mothers are like that?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>mothers</b></font>)</div>So this was the truth about mothers. The toads! '' Wendy, let us -LSB-let's-RSB- go home,'' cried John and Michael together.
<p/>They knew in what they called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother, and that it is only the mothers who think you can't.
<p/>At once,'' Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>): ``Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time.
<p/>This dread made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forgetful of what must be Peter's feelings, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) rather sharply, <div class="bookquote">``Peter, will you make the necessary arrangements?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, clutching them. '' Not to-night?'' asked the lost boys bewildered. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``If you wish it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) replied, as coolly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) to pass the nuts.
<p/>Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not mind the parting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was going to show her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), was Peter, that neither did he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>But of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cared very much; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was so full of wrath against grown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) got inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) tree he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the rate of about five to a second.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did this because there is a saying in the Neverland that, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies; and Peter was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible.
<p/>Then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) returned to the home, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) absence.
<p/>Panic-stricken at the thought of losing Wendy the lost boys had advanced upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) threateningly. '' It will be worse than before she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) came,'' they cried.
<p/>'' We shan't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) go. '' <div class="bookquote">``Let's keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) prisoner.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay, chain her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) up. ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) extremity an instinct told her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) to which of them to turn.
<p/>'' Tootles,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I appeal to you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Was it not strange? She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest one.
<p/>Grandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) silliness and spoke with dignity. '' I am just Tootles,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and nobody minds me.
<p/>But the first who does not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) severely. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) drew back his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hanger; and for that instant his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sun was at noon.
<p/>The others held back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once that they would get no support from him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>Wendy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, striding up and down, <div class="bookquote">``I have asked the redskins to guide you through the wood, as flying tires you so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be obeyed, <div class="bookquote">``Tinker Bell will take you across the sea.
<p/>Nibs had to knock twice before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) got an answer, though Tink had really been sitting up in bed listening for some time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) would keep no girl in the Neverland against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Peter.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Wake her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), Nibs. '' '' Who are you?
<p/>How dare you? Go away,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cried. '' You are to get up, Tink,'' Nibs called, <div class="bookquote">``and take Wendy on a journey.
<p/>Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was jolly well determined not to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) courier, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said so in still more offensive language.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) pretended to be asleep again. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) won't!'' Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination, whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady's chamber.
<p/>Tink,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) rapped out, <div class="bookquote">``if you don't get up and dress at once I will open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your negligee -LSB-nightgown-RSB-.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' This made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) leap to the floor. '' Who said I wasn't getting up? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried. In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now equipped with John and Michael for the journey.
<p/>By this time they were dejected, not merely because they were about to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), but also because they felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was going off to something nice to which they had not been invited.
<p/>Dear ones,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if you will all come with me I feel almost sure I can get my father and mother to adopt you.
<p/>The invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was thinking exclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.
<p/>Novelty was beckoning to them as usual. Crediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' '' But won't they think us rather a handful?
<p/>Oh no,'' said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, <div class="bookquote">``it will only mean having a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind the screens on first Thursdays.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Nibs asked in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) jump. '' <div class="bookquote">``Peter, can we go? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they all cried imploringly. They took it for granted that if they went he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would go also, but really they scarcely cared.
<p/>Thus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert their dearest ones. '' All right,'' Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediately they rushed to get their things.
<p/>And now, Peter,'' Wendy said, thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had put everything right, <div class="bookquote">``I am going to give you your medicine before you go.
<p/>Of course it was only water, but it was out of a bottle, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) always shook the bottle and counted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality.
<p/>On this occasion, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did not give Peter his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) draught -LSB-portion-RSB-, for just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had prepared it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw a look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) face that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) heart sink.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) loved to give them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. <div class="bookquote">``Get your things, Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cried, shaking.
<p/>To show that her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) departure would leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) unmoved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) skipped up and down the room, playing gaily on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) heartless pipes.
<p/>'' No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) answered, pretending indifference, <div class="bookquote">``I am not going with you, Wendy.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, Peter.'' <div class="bookquote">``No. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had to run about after him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), though it was rather undignified.
<p/>'' To find your mother,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) coaxed. Now, if Peter had ever quite had a mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) no longer missed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>No, no,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) told Wendy decisively; <div class="bookquote">``perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would say I was old, and I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could do very well without one. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had thought them out, and remembered only their bad points. '' '' But, Peter--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``No. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>And so the others had to be told. '' Peter isn't coming. '' Peter not coming! They gazed blankly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), their sticks over their backs, and on each stick a bundle.
<p/>Their first thought was that if Peter was not going he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had probably changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mind about letting them go. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was far too proud for that.
<p/>'' If you find your mothers,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said darkly, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you will like them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most of them began to look rather doubtful.
<p/>Now then,'' cried Peter, <div class="bookquote">``no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye, Wendy;''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hand cheerily, quite as if they must really go now, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had something important to do.
<p/>After all, their faces said, were they not noodles to want to go? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hand, and there was no indication that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would prefer a thimble.
<p/>'' You will remember about changing your flannels, Peter? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, lingering over him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was always so particular about their flannels.
<p/>'' Yes.'' '' And you will take your medicine?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed.
<p/>Peter, however, was not the kind that breaks down before other people. '' Are you ready, Tinker Bell? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) called out.
<p/>Tink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), for it was at this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the redskins.
<p/>'' Ay, ay.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then lead the way.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent with shrieks and the clash of steel.
<p/>Below, there was dead silence. Mouths opened and remained open. Wendy fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) knees, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arms were extended toward Peter.
<p/>All arms were extended to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), as if suddenly blown in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) direction; they were beseeching him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mutely not to desert them.
<p/>As for Peter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sword, the same he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) eye.
<p/>The pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the unscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins fairly is beyond the wit of the white man.
<p/>By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin who attacks, and with the wiliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) race he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does it just before the dawn, at which time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows the courage of the whites to be at its lowest ebb.
<p/>The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream runs, for it is destruction to be too far from water.
<p/>There they await the onslaught, the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and treading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just before the dawn.
<p/>Chapter 12 THE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF Through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade.
<p/>Not a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a wonderful imitation of the lonely call of the coyote.
<p/>The cry is answered by other braves; and some of them do it even better than the coyotes, who are not very good at it.
<p/>So the chill hours wear on, and the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface who has to live through it for the first time; but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the night is marching.
<p/>That this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that in disregarding it he (<font color='blue'><b>braves</b></font>) cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.
<p/>The Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his (<font color='blue'><b>braves</b></font>) honour, and their whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his (<font color='blue'><b>braves</b></font>).
<p/>The brushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived. They left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of their tribe.
<p/>With that alertness of the senses which is at once the marvel and despair of civilised peoples, they knew that the pirates were on the island from the moment one of them trod on a dry stick; and in an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began.
<p/>Every foot of ground between the spot where Hook had landed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) forces and the home under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing their mocassins with the heels in front.
<p/>They found only one hillock with a stream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) must establish himself and wait for just before the dawn.
<p/>Everything being thus mapped out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins folded their blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is to them, the pearl of manhood squatted above the children's home, awaiting the cold moment when they should deal pale death.
<p/>Here dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which they were to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) at break of day, those confiding savages were found by the treacherous Hook.
<p/>From the accounts afterwards supplied by such of the scouts as escaped the carnage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) does not seem even to have paused at the rising ground, though it is certain that in that grey light he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) must have seen it:
<p/>no thought of waiting to be attacked appears from first to last to have visited his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) subtle mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) would not even hold off till the night was nearly spent; on he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) pounded with no policy but to fall to -LSB-get into combat-RSB-.
<p/>What could the bewildered scouts do, masters as they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot helplessly after him (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>), exposing themselves fatally to view, while they gave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry.
<p/>Around the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) stoutest warriors, and they suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them.
<p/>Fell from their eyes then the film through which they had looked at victory. No more would they torture at the stake.
<p/>For them the happy hunting-grounds was now. They knew it; but as their father's sons they acquitted themselves. Even then they had time to gather in a phalanx -LSB-dense formation-RSB- that would have been hard to break
<p/>had they risen quickly, but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race. It is written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the presence of the white.
<p/>Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the pirates must have been to them, they remained stationary for a moment, not a muscle moving; as if the foe had come by invitation.
<p/>Then, indeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, they seized their weapons, and the air was torn with the war-cry; but it was now too late.
<p/>It is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a fight. Thus perished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe.
<p/>did they die, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to disturb the Spanish Main no more, and among others who bit the dust were Geo.
<p/>Turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther, who ultimately cut a way through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of the tribe.
<p/>Not all unavenged Scourie, Chas. Turley, and the Alsatian Foggerty. To what extent Hook is to blame for his (<font color='blue'><b>Turley</b></font>) tactics on this occasion is for the historian to decide.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Turley</b></font>) waited on the rising ground till the proper hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Turley</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Turley</b></font>) men would probably have been butchered; and in judging him (<font color='blue'><b>Turley</b></font>) it is only fair to take this into account.
<p/>On the other hand, this, as destroying the element of surprise, would have made his (<font color='blue'><b>Turley</b></font>) strategy of no avail, so that the whole question is beset with difficulties.
<p/>One cannot at least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme, and the fell -LSB-deadly-RSB- genius with which it was carried out.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) should perhaps have done was to acquaint his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) opponents that he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) proposed to follow a new method. What were his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment?
<p/>Fain -LSB-gladly-RSB- would his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses, they gathered at a discreet distance from his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) hook, and squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man.
<p/>Elation must have been in his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) heart, but his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) face did not reflect it: ever a dark and solitary enigma, he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) stood aloof from his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) followers in spirit as in substance.
<p/>The night's work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) had come out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) should get at the honey.
<p/>It was Pan he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) wanted, Pan and Wendy and their band, but chiefly Pan. Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man's hatred of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>True he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had flung Hook's arm to the crocodile, but even this and the increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to the crocodile's pertinacity -LSB-persistance-RSB-, hardly account for a vindictiveness so relentless and malignant.
<p/>The truth is that there was a something about Peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) courage, it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) engaging appearance, it was not--.
<p/>There is no beating about the bush, for we know quite well what it was, and have got to tell. It was Peter's cockiness.
<p/>This had got on Hook's nerves; it made his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) iron claw twitch, and at night it disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) like an insect.
<p/>While Peter lived, the tortured man felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.
<p/>The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) dogs down? He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest ones.
<p/>They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would not scruple -LSB-hesitate-RSB- to ram them down with poles. In the meantime, what of the boys?
<p/>We have seen them at the first clang of the weapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all appealing with outstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as their mouths close, and their arms fall to their sides.
<p/>The pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce gust of wind; but they know that in the passing it has determined their fate.
<p/>The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the question put by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter's answer.
<p/>Which side had won? '' If the redskins have won,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``they will beat the tom-tom; it is always their sign of victory.
<p/>You will never hear the tom-tom again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) muttered, but inaudibly of course, for strict silence had been enjoined -LSB-urged-RSB-. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) amazement
<p/>Hook signed him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order.
<p/>'' Now Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it. '' Never, probably, had this simple man admired Hook so much.
<p/>Twice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen gleefully. '' The tom-tom,'' the miscreants heard Peter cry; <div class="bookquote">``an Indian victory!
<p/>The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter.
<p/>This puzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the trees.
<p/>Rapidly and silently Hook gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) orders: one man to each tree, and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards apart.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands. Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES? The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) rose out of it into the arms of Cecco, who flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) to Smee, who flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) to Starkey, who flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) to Bill Jukes, who flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) to Noodler, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) was tossed from one to another till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) fell at the feet of the black pirate.
<p/>All the boys were plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner; and several of them were in the air at a time, like bales of goods flung from hand to hand.
<p/>With ironical politeness Hook raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) hat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>), and, offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) arm, escorted her (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) to the spot where the others were being gagged.
<p/>The first to emerge from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) tree was Curly. A different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) did it with such an air, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) was so frightfully DISTINGUE
<p/>Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), and we tell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) only because her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) slip led to strange results.
<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) haughtily unhanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) -LRB-and we should have loved to write it of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would have been hurled through the air like the others, and then Hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the children; and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) not been at the tying he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) would not have discovered Slightly's secret, and without the secret he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) could not presently have made his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) foul attempt on Peter's life.
<p/>They were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their knees close to their ears; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces.
<p/>-LSB-imposingly distinguished-RSB-, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) was too fascinated to cry out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) was only a little girl. All went well until Slightly's turn came,
<p/>when he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string in going round and leave no tags -LSB-ends-RSB- with which to tie a knot.
<p/>The pirates kicked him (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) in their rage, just as you kick the parcel -LRB-though in fairness you should kick the string-RRB-; and strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence.
<p/>While his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) dogs were merely sweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one part he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) bulged out in another, Hook's master mind had gone far beneath Slightly's surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) exultation showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) had found them.
<p/>Slightly, white to the gills, knew that Hook had surprised -LSB-discovered-RSB- his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) secret, which was this, that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick.
<p/>Poor Slightly, most wretched of all the children now, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in a panic about Peter, bitterly regretted what he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had done.
<p/>Madly addicted to the drinking of water when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was hot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had swelled in consequence to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) present girth, and instead of reducing himself to fit his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) tree he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had, unknown to the others, whittled his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) tree to make it fit him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) that Peter at last lay at his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterranean caverns of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mind crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) lips; he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) merely signed that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would be alone.
<p/>Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be rolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) lip was curled with malicious triumph. How to convey them? Again Hook's genius surmounted difficulties. He (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) indicated that the little house must be used as a conveyance.
<p/>The children were flung into it, four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders, the others fell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession set off through the wood.
<p/>I don't know whether any of the children were crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound; but as the little house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from its chimney as if defying Hook.
<p/>Hook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) that may have remained in the pirate's infuriated breast.
<p/>The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) did on finding himself alone in the fast falling night was to tiptoe to Slightly's tree, and make sure that it provided him (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) with a passage.
<p/>Then for long he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) remained brooding; his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) hat of ill omen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) hair.
<p/>Intently he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) listened for any sound from the nether world, but all was as silent below as above; the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void.
<p/>Was that boy asleep, or did he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stand waiting at the foot of Slightly's tree, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dagger in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand?
<p/>Dark as were his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thoughts his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle. There was no way of knowing, save by going down.
<p/>Hook let his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cloak slip softly to the ground, and then biting his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lips till a lewd blood stood on them, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stepped into the tree.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a brave man, but for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had to stop there and wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) brow, which was dripping like a candle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again, biting at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breath, which had almost left him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>As his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes became accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape; but the only one on which his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) greedy gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was the great bed.
<p/>Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a little time after the children left, to play gaily on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) pipes:
<p/>Then, silently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) let himself go into the unknown. On the bed lay Peter fast asleep. no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did not care.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) still more; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had always tucked them inside it, because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) decided not to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) nearly cried; but it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) how indignant she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would be if he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) laughed instead
<p/>; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it. Sometimes, though not often, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had dreams, and they were more painful than the dreams of other boys.
<p/>For hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could not be separated from these dreams, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I think, with the riddle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) existence.
<p/>At such times it had been Wendy's custom to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) out of bed and sit with him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lap, soothing him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) in dear ways of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) own invention, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) grew calmer to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) back to bed before he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) quite woke up, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) should not know of the indignity to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had subjected him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>One arm dropped over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) laugh was stranded on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mouth, which was open, showing the little pearls.
<p/>But on this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. Thus defenceless Hook found him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) enemy.
<p/>Did no feeling of compassion disturb his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) loved flowers -LRB-I have been told-RRB- and sweet music -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was himself
<p/>no mean performer on the harpsichord-RRB-; and , let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) profoundly.
<p/>Mastered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) better self he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one thing. What stayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was Peter's impertinent appearance as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) slept.
<p/>The open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness.
<p/>If his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) rage had broken him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) into a hundred pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt at the sleeper.
<p/>Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) discovered an obstacle, the door of Slightly's tree.
<p/>They steeled Hook's heart. It did not entirely fill the aperture, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) found to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) fury that it was low down, beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) reach.
<p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter's face and figure visibly increased, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) rattled the door and flung himself against it.
<p/>Was his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) enemy to escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) after all? But what was that? The red in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) eye had caught sight of Peter's medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach.
<p/>Lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) person a dreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that had come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) possession.
<p/>These he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent poison in existence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) fathomed what it was straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) power. Five drops of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) now added to Peter's cup.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did it he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) avoided glancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>); merely to avoid spilling.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hand shook, but it was in exultation rather than in shame. Then one long gloating look he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cast upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) victim, and turning, wormed his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) way with difficulty up the tree.
<p/>Donning his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hat at its most rakish angle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) wound his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cloak around him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), holding one end in front as if to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) person from the night, of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to himself, stole away through the trees.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) emerged at the top he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole. Peter slept on. The light guttered -LSB-burned to edges-RSB- and went out, leaving the tenement in darkness; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) slept.
<p/>It must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) suddenly sat up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) bed, wakened by he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
<p/>knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) tree. Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister.
<p/>Peter felt for his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) dagger till his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hand gripped it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) spoke. '' Who is that? '' For long there was no answer: then again the knock.
<p/>'' Who are you? '' No answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was thrilled, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) loved being thrilled. In two strides he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) reached the door.
<p/>Unlike Slightly's door, it filled the aperture -LSB-opening-RSB-, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could not see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>'' I won't open unless you speak,'' Peter cried. Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice. <div class="bookquote">``Let me in, Peter.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was Tink, and quickly he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) unbarred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) flew in excitedly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) face flushed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) dress stained with mud.
<p/>'' What is it?'' '' Oh, you could never guess! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried, and offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) three guesses. '' Out with it!
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long as the ribbons that conjurers -LSB-magicians-RSB- pull from their mouths, she (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) told of the capture of Wendy and the boys.
<p/>'' Peter's heart bobbed up and down as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) listened. Wendy bound, and on the pirate ship; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) who loved everything to be just so!
<p/>'' I'll rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>)! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried, leaping at his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) weapons. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) leapt he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thought of something he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could do to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could take his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) medicine. His (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hand closed on the fatal draught. '' No! '' shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) deed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) sped through the forest.
<p/>'' Why not?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is poisoned. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hook. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't be silly. How could Hook have got down here?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Tinker</b></font>)</div>Alas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did not know the dark secret of Slightly's tree. Nevertheless Hook's words had left no room for doubt.
<p/>No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) lightning movements Tink got between his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) lips and the draught, and drained it to the dregs.
<p/>The cup was poisoned. '' Besides,'' said Peter, quite believing himself, <div class="bookquote">``I never fell asleep. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) raised the cup. ''
<p/>Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine? '' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did not answer. Already she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was reeling in the air.
<p/>'' What is the matter with you? '' cried Peter, suddenly afraid. '' It was poisoned, Peter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) softly; <div class="bookquote">``and now I am going to be dead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wings would scarcely carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) now, but in reply she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) alighted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) shoulder and gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) nose a loving bite.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Tink, did you drink it to save me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But why, Tink? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) ear <div class="bookquote">``You silly ass,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and then, tottering to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) chamber, lay down on the bed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) head almost filled the fourth wall of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) little room as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) knelt near her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) in distress. Every moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) light was growing fainter; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) knew that if it went out she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would be no more.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) tears so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) beautiful finger and let them run over it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) voice was so low that at first he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could not make out what she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) made it out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could get well again if children believed in fairies.
<p/>There were no children there, and it was night time; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and who were therefore nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) than you think: boys and girls in their nighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.
<p/>Peter flung out his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) arms. '' Do you believe? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried. Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fate.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wasn't sure. '' What do you think? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked Peter.
<p/>'' If you believe,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) shouted to them, <div class="bookquote">``clap your hands; don't let Tink die. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Many clapped. Some didn't. A few beasts hissed.
<p/>The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to their nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was saved.
<p/>First her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) voice grew strong, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) popped out of bed, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) never thought of thanking those who believed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would have liked to get at the ones who had hissed.
<p/>The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) tree, begirt -LSB-belted-RSB- with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) perilous quest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) shadow through the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was astir.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) regretted now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach.
<p/>'' And now to rescue Wendy!'' It was not such a night as he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would have chosen. There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at which happily he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was an adept
<p/>A light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks; and a deathly silence pervaded the island, as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of the recent carnage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had taught the children something of the forest lore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell, and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it.
<p/>-LSB-expert-RSB-. But in what direction, for he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship? Slightly, if he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) had an opportunity, would blaze -LSB-cut a mark in-RSB-
<p/>the trees, for instance, Curly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) handkerchief at some important place. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Curly</b></font>) could not wait.
<p/>The crocodile passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Curly</b></font>), but not another living thing, not a sound, not a movement; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Curly</b></font>) knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree, or stalking him (<font color='blue'><b>Curly</b></font>) from behind.
<p/>The upper world had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Curly</b></font>), but would give no help. He (<font color='blue'><b>Curly</b></font>) swore this terrible oath: <div class="bookquote">``Hook or me this time.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Curly</b></font>) crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Curly</b></font>) darted across a space on which the moonlight played, one finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>Curly</b></font>) lip and his (<font color='blue'><b>Curly</b></font>) dagger at the ready.
<p/>Chapter 14 THE PIRATE SHIP One green light squinting over Kidd's Creek, which is near the mouth of the pirate river, marked where the brig, the JOLLY ROGER, lay, low in the water; a rakish-looking -LSB-speedy-looking-RSB- craft foul to the hull, every beam in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) detestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was the cannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) floated immune in the horror of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) name.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>cannibal</b></font>) was frightfully happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could have reached the shore.
<p/>There was little sound, and none agreeable save the whir of the ship's sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee.
<p/>I know not why he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) was so infinitely pathetic, unless it were because he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) was so pathetically unaware of it; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>), and more than once on summer evenings he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) had touched the fount of Hook's tears and made it flow.
<p/>A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma -LSB-putrid mist-RSB- of the night; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck, where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out of Hook's reach, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) should claw them mechanically in passing.
<p/>Of this, as of almost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious. Hook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hour of triumph.
<p/>Peter had been removed for ever from his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) path, and all the other boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) grimmest deed since the days when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had brought Barbecue to heel; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could we be surprised had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) success?
<p/>But there was no elation in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gait, which kept pace with the action of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude of the night. It was because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so terribly alone.
<p/>This inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dogs. They were socially inferior to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Hook was not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) true name.
<p/>To reveal who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the lines must already have guessed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been at a famous public school; and its traditions still clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned.
<p/>Thus it was offensive to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even now to board a ship in the same dress in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grappled -LSB-attacked-RSB- her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still adhered in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walk to the school's distinguished slouch.
<p/>But above all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) retained the passion for good form. Good form! However much he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may have degenerated, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still knew that this is all that really matters.
<p/>From far within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through them came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when one cannot sleep.
<p/>'' Have you been good form to-day? '' was their eternal question. '' Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried.
<p/>'' Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?'' the tap-tap from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) school replied. '' I am the only man whom Barbecue feared,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) urged, <div class="bookquote">``and Flint feared Barbecue.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Barbecue, Flint--what house?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came the cutting retort. Most disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about good form?
<p/>It was a claw within him (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) sharper than the iron one; and as it tore him (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>), the perspiration dripped down his (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) tallow -LSB-waxy-RSB- countenance and streaked his (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) doublet.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) vitals were tortured by this problem. Ofttimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) sleeve across his (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) face, but there was no damming that trickle.
<p/>Ah, envy not Hook. There came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) a presentiment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) early dissolution -LSB-death-RSB-. It was as if Peter's terrible oath had boarded the ship.
<p/>Hook felt a gloomy desire to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) dying speech, lest presently there should be no time for it. '' Better for Hook,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had had less ambition!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) darkest hours only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) referred to himself in the third person. '' No little children to love me!''
<p/>Strange that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) should think of this, which had never troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) before; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mind.
<p/>For long he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) muttered to himself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under the conviction that all children feared him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>).
<p/>Feared him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>)! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that night who did not already love him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) had said horrid things to them and hit them with the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) hand, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) could not hit with his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) fist, but they had only clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) the more.
<p/>Michael had tried on his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) spectacles. To tell poor Smee that they thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) lovable! Hook itched to do it, but it seemed too brutal.
<p/>Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) revolved this mystery in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) mind: why do they find Smee lovable? He (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) was.
<p/>If Smee was lovable, what was it that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itself--<div class="bookquote">``Good form? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Had the bo`sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of all?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) remembered that you have to prove you don't know you have it before you are eligible for Pop -LSB-an elite social club at Eton-RSB-.
<p/>With a cry of rage he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) iron hand over Smee's head; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) did not tear. What arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) was this reflection:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To claw a man because he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) is good form, what would that be?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bad form! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The unhappy Hook was as impotent -LSB-powerless-RSB- as he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) was damp, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) fell forward like a cut flower.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) dogs thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) out of the way for a time, discipline instantly relaxed; and they broke into a bacchanalian -LSB-drunken-RSB- dance, which brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) feet at once, all traces of human weakness gone, as if a bucket of water had passed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>).
<p/>'' Quiet, you scugs,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``or I'll cast anchor in you;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and at once the din was hushed. '' Are all the children chained, so that they cannot fly away?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Then hoist them up. '' The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy, and ranged in line in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>).
<p/>For a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) seemed unconscious of their presence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) lolled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) ease, humming, not unmelodiously, snatches of a rude song, and fingering a pack of cards.
<p/>Now then, bullies,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) said briskly, <div class="bookquote">``six of you walk the plank to-night, but I have room for two cabin boys.
<p/>Ever and anon the light from his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) cigar gave a touch of colour to his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) face. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Which of you is it to be?''
<p/>Tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a somewhat silly boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) unnecessarily,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>had been Wendy's instructions in the hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. All children know this about mothers, and despise them for it, but make constant use of it.
<p/>So Tootles explained prudently, <div class="bookquote">``You see, sir, I don't think my mother would like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a pirate, Slightly?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as if he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) wished things had been otherwise. ''
<p/>Would your mother like you to be a pirate, Twin?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the twin</b></font>)</div>said the first twin, as clever as the others.
<p/>'' Nibs, would--'' <div class="bookquote">``Stow this gab,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spokesmen</b></font>)</div>roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back. '' You, boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, addressing John, <div class="bookquote">``you look as if you had a little pluck in you.
<p/>Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was struck by Hook's picking him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) out.
<p/>'' I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said diffidently. '' And a good name too. We'll call you that here, bully, if you join.''
<p/>'' What do you think, Michael?'' asked John. '' What would you call me if I join?'' Michael demanded. '' Blackbeard Joe.
<p/>'' Michael was naturally impressed. '' What do you think, John?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wanted John to decide, and John wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to decide.
<p/>'' Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King?'' John inquired. Through Hook's teeth came the answer: <div class="bookquote">``You would have to swear, `Down with the King.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shone out now. '' Then I refuse,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook.
<p/>'' And I refuse,'' cried Michael. '' Rule Britannia! '' squeaked Curly. The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out, <div class="bookquote">``That seals your doom.
<p/>Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The pirates</b></font>)</div>They were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing the fatal plank.
<p/>But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up. No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates.
<p/>To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years.
<p/>There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger <div class="bookquote">``Dirty pig'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had already written it on several.
<p/>But as the boys gathered round her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had no thought, of course, save for them. '' So, my beauty,'' said Hook, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) spoke in syrup, <div class="bookquote">``you are to see your children walk the plank.
<p/>Fine gentlemen though he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) was, the intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) communings had soiled his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) ruff, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was gazing at it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With a hasty gesture he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) tried to hide it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) was too late. '' Are they to die? '' asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful contempt that he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) nearly fainted.
<p/>'' They are,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) snarled. '' Silence all,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) called gloatingly, <div class="bookquote">``for a mother's last words to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At this moment Wendy was grand.
<p/>'' These are my last words, dear boys,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said firmly. '' I feel that I have a message to you from your real mothers, and it is this: '
<p/>We hope our sons will die like English gentlemen.' '' Even the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, <div class="bookquote">``I am going to do what my mother hopes.
<p/>What are you to do, Nibs?''  (<font color='red'><b>the pirates</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What my mother hopes. John, what are--''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But Hook had found his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) voice again. <div class="bookquote">``Tie her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shouted. It was Smee who tied her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to the mast.
<p/>'' See here, honey,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``I'll save you if you promise to be my mother. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But not even for Smee would she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) make such a promise.
<p/>It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as Smee tied her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to the mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they were about to take.
<p/>They were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from them; they could stare and shiver only.
<p/>'' I would almost rather have no children at all,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said disdainfully -LSB-scornfully-RSB-. Hook smiled on them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) teeth closed, and took a step toward Wendy.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) intention was to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) face so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) should see the boys walking the plank one by one. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) never reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) never heard the cry of anguish he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) hoped to wring from her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>They all heard it--pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was blown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but toward Hook.
<p/>All knew that what was about to happen concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) alone, and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) heard something else instead. It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile. Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>).
<p/>The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly thought, <div class="bookquote">``The crocodile is about to board the ship!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted.
<p/>Left so fearfully alone, any other man would have lain with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes shut where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell: but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working, and under its guidance he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could go.
<p/>The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and it was only when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought up against the bulwarks that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke.
<p/>It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been clipped at every joint. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell in a little heap. '' Hide me!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried hoarsely.
<p/>They gathered round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), all eyes averted from the thing that was coming aboard. They had no thought of fighting it.
<p/>Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys so that they could rush to the ship's side to see the crocodile climbing it.
<p/>Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid.
<p/>It was Fate. It was Peter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse suspicion.
<p/>Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our noticing for a time that they have happened.
<p/>Thus, to take an instance, we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we don't know how long, but, say, half an hour.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) went on ticking. Chapter 15 <div class="bookquote">``HOOK OR ME THIS TIME ''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Now such an experience had come that night to Peter.
<p/>When last we saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was stealing across the island with one finger to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) lips and his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) dagger at the ready.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it, but by and by he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) remembered that it had not been ticking.
<p/>Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter began to consider how he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could turn the catastrophe to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) own use; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was the crocodile and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) pass unmolested.
<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) ticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result.
<p/>The crocodile was among those who heard the sound, and it followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), though whether with the purpose of regaining what it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a fixed idea, it was a stupid beast.
<p/>Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element.
<p/>Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom I know. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) swam he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had
<p/>but one thought: <div class="bookquote">``Hook or me this time. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had ticked so long that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) now went on ticking without knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was doing it.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) known he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had scaled her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) side as noiseless as a mouse; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), with Hook in their midst as abject as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had heard the crocodile.
<p/>The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) heard the ticking. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) looked behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) swiftly.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) realised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was doing it himself, and in a flash he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) understood the situation. '' How clever of me!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into applause. It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the forecastle and came along the deck.
<p/>Now, reader, time what happened by your watch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hands on the ill-fated pirate's mouth to stifle the dying groan.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fell forward. Four boys caught him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and the carrion was cast overboard.
<p/>None too soon, Peter, every inch of him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) on tiptoe, vanished into the cabin; for more than one pirate was screwing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) courage to look round.
<p/>There was a splash, and then silence. How long has it taken? <div class="bookquote">``One!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Slightly had begun to count.-RRB- They could hear each other's distressed breathing now, which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed.
<p/>Slowly Hook let his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) head emerge from his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) ruff, and listened so intently that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could have caught the echo of the tick.
<p/>'' It's gone, captain,'' Smee said, wiping off his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) spectacles. '' All's still again. '' There was not a sound, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) drew himself up firmly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) full height.
<p/>'' Then here's to Johnny Plank! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Plank</b></font>) cried brazenly, hating the boys more than ever because they had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Plank</b></font>) unbend.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Plank</b></font>) broke into the villainous ditty: ``Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank, You walks along it so, Till it goes down and you goes down To Davy Jones below!
<p/>To terrorize the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of dignity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) sang; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) finished he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``Do you want a touch of the cat -LSB-o' nine tails-RSB- before you walk the plank?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' At that they fell on their knees. '' No, no! '' they cried so piteously that every pirate smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Fetch the cat, Jukes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Hook; <div class="bookquote">``it's in the cabin.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other. '' Ay, ay,'' said Jukes blithely, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) strode into the cabin.
<p/>They followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) song, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) dogs joining in with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat, Its tails are nine, you know, And when they're writ upon your back--''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin.
<p/>Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech.
<p/>It wailed through the ship, and died away. '' What was that? '' cried Hook. <div class="bookquote">``Two,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Slightly solemnly. The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) tottered out, haggard. '' What's the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog? '' hissed Hook, towering over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>). '' The matter wi' him (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>)'s dead, stabbed,'' replied Cecco in a hollow voice.
<p/>The cabin's as black as a pit,'' Cecco said, almost gibbering, <div class="bookquote">``but there is something terrible in there: the thing you heard crowing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Cecco</b></font>)</div>Bill Jukes dead!'' cried the startled pirates. '' '' The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both were seen by Hook.
<p/>'' Cecco,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) most steely voice, <div class="bookquote">``go back and fetch me out that doodle-doo. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Cecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) captain, crying <div class="bookquote">``No, no'' (<font color='red'><b>captain</b></font>)</div>; but Hook was purring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) claw.
<p/>'' Did you say you would go, Cecco? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) said musingly. Cecco went, first flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) arms despairingly. There was no more singing,
<p/>all listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a crow. No one spoke except Slightly. '' Three,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) said.
<p/>Hook rallied his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) dogs with a gesture. '''S`death and odds fish,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) thundered, <div class="bookquote">``who is to bring me that doodle-doo?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Wait till Cecco comes out,'' growled Starkey, and the others took up the cry. '' I think I heard you volunteer, Starkey,'' said Hook, purring again.
<p/>'' No, by thunder! '' Starkey cried. '' My hook thinks you did,'' said Hook, crossing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>). '' I wonder if it would not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll swing before I go in there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Starkey</b></font>)</div>replied Starkey doggedly, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) had the support of the crew. '' Is this mutiny?
<p/>'' asked Hook more pleasantly than ever. '' Starkey's ringleader!'' <div class="bookquote">``Captain, mercy! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Starkey</b></font>)</div>Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now. ''
<p/>Shake hands, Starkey,'' said Hook, proffering his (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) claw. Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>). As he (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) backed up Hook advanced, and now the red spark was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) eye.
<p/>With a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the sea. <div class="bookquote">``Four,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Slightly. '' And now,'' Hook said courteously, <div class="bookquote">``did any other gentlemen say mutiny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hook/James Hook</b></font>)</div><p/>Seizing a lantern and raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) claw with a menacing gesture, <div class="bookquote">``I'll bring out that doodle-doo myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) said, and sped into the cabin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Five. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>How Slightly longed to say it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) wetted his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) lips to be ready, but Hook came staggering out, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) lantern. ''
<p/>Something blew out the light,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) said a little unsteadily. '' Something! '' echoed Mullins. '' What of Cecco?'' demanded Noodler.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mullins</b></font>)'s as dead as Jukes,'' said Hook shortly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jukes</b></font>) reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably, and the mutinous sounds again broke forth.
<p/>All pirates are superstitious, and Cookson cried, <div class="bookquote">``They do say the surest sign a ship's accurst is when there's one on board more than can be accounted for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cookson</b></font>)</div><p/>They say,'' said another, looking viciously at Hook, ``that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cookson</b></font>) comes it's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mullins</b></font>)</div>muttered Mullins, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Mullins</b></font>) always boards the pirate craft last. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Mullins</b></font>) a tail, captain?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mullins</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Mullins</b></font>) a hook, captain?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cookson</b></font>)</div>asked Cookson insolently; and one after another took up the cry, <div class="bookquote">``The ship's doomed!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cookson</b></font>)</div><p/>At this the children could not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Cookson</b></font>) prisoners, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cookson</b></font>) swung round on them now his (<font color='blue'><b>Cookson</b></font>) face lit up again.
<p/>'' Lads,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cookson</b></font>) cried to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cookson</b></font>) crew, <div class="bookquote">``now here's a notion. Open the cabin door and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives.
<p/>If they kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Cookson</b></font>), we're so much the better; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cookson</b></font>) kills them, we're none the worse. ''  (<font color='red'><b>crew</b></font>)</div>For the last time his (<font color='blue'><b>Cookson</b></font>) dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his (<font color='blue'><b>Cookson</b></font>) bidding.
<p/>The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them. '' Now, listen! '' cried Hook, and all listened.
<p/>But not one dared to face the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the mast.
<p/>It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was watching, it was for the reappearance of Peter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had not long to wait.
<p/>In the cabin he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had found the thing for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had gone in search: the key that would free the children of their manacles, and now they all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they could find.
<p/>First signing them to hide, Peter cut Wendy's bonds, and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off together; but one thing barred the way, an oath, <div class="bookquote">``Hook or me this time.
<p/>So when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had freed Wendy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) whispered for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) to conceal herself with the others, and himself took her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) place by the mast, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cloak around him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) should pass for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin; and they were panic-stricken.
<p/>Hook tried to hearten them; but like the dogs he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had made them they showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) their fangs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) knew that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) eyes off them now they would leap at him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>Lads,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never quailing for an instant, <div class="bookquote">``I've thought it out.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) took a great breath and crowed. '' There's a Jonah aboard.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they snarled, <div class="bookquote">``a man wi' a hook.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, lads, no, it's the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship wi' a woman on board. We'll right the ship when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s gone.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Flint</b></font>)</div>Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint's. '' It's worth trying,'' they said doubtfully. ''
<p/>Fling the girl overboard,'' cried Hook; and they made a rush at the figure in the cloak. '' There's none can save you now, missy,
<p/>'' Mullins hissed jeeringly. '' There's one,'' replied the figure. '' Who's that?'' '' Peter Pan the avenger!'' came the terrible answer; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) spoke Peter flung off his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cloak.
<p/>Then they all knew who 'twas that had been undoing them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) failed.
<p/>In that frightful moment I think his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) fierce heart broke. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``Cleave him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) to the brisket! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but without conviction.
<p/>'' Down, boys, and at them!'' Peter's voice rang out; and in another moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship.
<p/>Had the pirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the onset came when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, striking wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew.
<p/>Man to man they were the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry.
<p/>Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they were found by Slightly, who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flashed in their faces, so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys.
<p/>There was little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously counting--five--six--seven eight--nine--ten--eleven.
<p/>I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who seemed to have a charmed life, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept them at bay in that circle of fire.
<p/>They had done for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all. Again and again they closed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and again and again he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hewed a clear space.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lifted up one boy with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hook, and was using him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a buckler -LSB-shield-RSB-, when another, who had just passed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put up your swords, boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>the newcomer</b></font>)</div>cried the newcomer, <div class="bookquote">``this man is mine. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the newcomer</b></font>)</div>Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter.
<p/>For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) face.
<p/>The others drew back and formed a ring around them. '' So, Pan,'' said Hook at last, <div class="bookquote">``this is all your doing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pan</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay, James Hook,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came the stern answer, <div class="bookquote">``it is all my doing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Proud and insolent youth,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Hook, <div class="bookquote">``prepare to meet thy doom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dark and sinister man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Peter answered, <div class="bookquote">``have at thee. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage to either blade.
<p/>Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling rapidity; ever and anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) foe's defence, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) shorter reach stood him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) in ill stead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could not drive the steel home.
<p/>Hook, scarcely his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) back by the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust, taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) astonishment he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) found this thrust turned aside again and again.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sought to close and give the quietus with his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) iron hook, which all this time had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely, pierced him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) in the ribs.
<p/>At the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) own blood, whose peculiar colour, you remember, was offensive to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), the sword fell from Hook's hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) was at Peter's mercy.
<p/>'' Now!'' cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) opponent to pick up his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.
<p/>Hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had thought it was some fiend fighting him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), but darker suspicions assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) now. '' Pan, who and what art thou?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried huskily.
<p/>'' I'm youth, I'm joy,'' Peter answered at a venture, <div class="bookquote">``I'm a little bird that has broken out of the egg.
<p/>This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was, which is the very pinnacle of good form.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but Peter fluttered round him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) as if the very wind it made blew him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) out of the danger zone.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>'' To't again,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried despairingly. And again and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) darted in and pricked. Hook was fighting now without hope.
<p/>That passionate breast no longer asked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form before it was cold forever.
<p/>Abandoning the fight he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) rushed into the powder magazine and fired it. '' In two minutes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``the ship will be blown to pieces.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Now, now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thought, true form will show. But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hands, and calmly flung it overboard.
<p/>Misguided man though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, we may be glad, without sympathising with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that in the end he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was true to the traditions of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) race.
<p/>The other boys were flying around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now, flouting, scornful; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) staggered about the deck striking up at them impotently, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up -LSB-to the headmaster-RSB- for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall.
<p/>What sort of form was Hook himself showing? And his (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) shoes were right, and his (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) waistcoat was right, and his (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) tie was right, and his (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) socks were right.
<p/>Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) through the air with dagger poised, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>); for we purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>): a little mark of respect from us at the end.
<p/>James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell. For we have come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) last moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) stood on the bulwark looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) shoulder at Peter gliding through the air, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) with a gesture to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) foot.
<p/>It made Peter kick instead of stab. At last Hook had got the boon for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) craved. '' Bad form,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.
<p/>Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two reached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him (<font color='blue'><b>Starkey</b></font>) nurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and Smee, who henceforth wandered about the world in his (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) spectacles, making a precarious living by saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Smee</b></font>) was the only man that Jas.
<p/>Thus perished James Hook. '' Seventeen ,'' Slightly sang out; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) was not quite correct in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hook</b></font>) figures. Hook had feared.
<p/>Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though watching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) became prominent again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) praised them equally, and shuddered delightfully when Michael showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) had killed one; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) took them into Hook's cabin and pointed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) watch which was hanging on a nail.
<p/>It said <div class="bookquote">``half-past one!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) got them to bed in the pirates' bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure;
<p/>all but Peter, who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) fell asleep by the side of Long Tom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dreams that night, and cried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sleep for a long time, and Wendy held him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tightly.
<p/>By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps -LSB-legs-RSB-; for there was a big sea running; and Tootles, the bo`sun, was among them, with a rope's end in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand and chewing tobacco.
<p/>They all donned pirate clothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up, with the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers.
<p/>Chapter 16 THE RETURN HOME It need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and second mate.
<p/>Peter had already lashed himself to the wheel; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) piped all hands and delivered a short address to them; said he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hoped they would do their duty like gallant hearties, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast, and if they snapped at him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would tear them.
<p/>There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars -LSB-sailors-RSB- before the mast, and lived in the fo`c`sle. The bluff strident words struck the note sailors understood, and they cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) lustily.
<p/>Captain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship's chart, that if this weather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June, after which it would save time to fly.
<p/>Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour of keeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they dared not express their wishes to him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) even in a round robin -LSB-one person after another, as they had to Cpt.
<p/>Then a few sharp orders were given, and they turned the ship round, and nosed her (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) for the mainland. Hook-RSB-. Instant obedience was the only safe thing.
<p/>The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to lull Wendy's suspicions, but that there might be a change when the new suit was ready, which, against her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) will, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was making for him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) out of some of Hook's wickedest garments.
<p/>It was afterwards whispered among them that on the first night he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) wore this suit he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sat long in the cabin with Hook's cigar-holder in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mouth and
<p/>Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take soundings. one hand clenched, all but for the forefinger, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook.
<p/>Instead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago.
<p/>It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this time; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us.
<p/>If we had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) would probably have cried, <div class="bookquote">``Don't be silly; what do I matter?
<p/>So long as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of them; and they may lay to -LSB-bet on-RSB- that.
<p/>Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful occupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs. Darling do not go out for the evening.
<p/>Do go back and keep an eye on the children. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>We are no more than servants. Why on earth should their beds be properly aired, seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry?
<p/>Would it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that their parents were spending the week-end in the country?
<p/>It would be the moral lesson they have been in need of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things in this way Mrs. Darling would never forgive us.
<p/>One thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>), in the way authors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed they will be here on Thursday week.
<p/>They have been planning it out on the ship: mother's rapture, father's shout of joy, Nana's leap through the air to embrace them first, when what they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding.
<p/>How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news in advance; so that when they enter grandly Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mouth, and Mr. Darling may exclaim pettishly, <div class="bookquote">``Dash it all, here are those boys again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darling</b></font>)</div><p/>This would spoil so completely the surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward. However, we should get no thanks even for this.
<p/>We are beginning to know Mrs. Darling by this time, and may be sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would upbraid us for depriving the children of their little pleasure.
<p/>But, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that by telling you what's what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness.''
<p/>'' '' Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of delight. '' '' Oh, if you look at it in that way!''
<p/>'' What other way is there in which to look at it? '' You see, the woman had no proper spirit.
<p/>I had meant to say extraordinarily nice things about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); but I despise her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and not one of them will I say now.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not really need to be told to have things ready, for they are ready. All the beds are aired, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never leaves the house, and observe, the window is open.
<p/>For all the use we are to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), we might well go back to the ship. However, as we are here we may as well stay and look on.
<p/>That is all we are, lookers-on. Nobody really wants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, in the hope that some of them will hurt.
<p/>The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine and six the kennel is no longer there.
<p/>When the children flew away, Mr. Darling felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) bones that all the blame was his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) for having chained Nana up, and that from first to last she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) had been wiser than he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>).
<p/>Of course, as we have seen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was quite a simple man; indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) might have passed for a boy again if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had been able to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) baldness off; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had also a noble sense of justice and a lion's courage to do what seemed right to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>); and having thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of the children, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) went down on all fours and crawled into the kennel.
<p/>To all Mrs. Darling's dear invitations to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) to come out he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) replied sadly but firmly: <div class="bookquote">``No, my own one, this is the place for me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In the bitterness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) remorse he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) swore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) would never leave the kennel until his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) children came back.
<p/>Of course this was a pity; but whatever Mr. Darling did he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had to do in excess, otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) soon gave up doing it.
<p/>And there never was a more humble man than the once proud George Darling, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) wife of their children and all their pretty ways.
<p/>Very touching was his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) deference to Nana. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) come into the kennel, but on all other matters he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) wishes implicitly.
<p/>Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab, which conveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) office, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) returned home in the same way at six.
<p/>Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen if we remember how sensitive he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to the opinion of neighbours: this man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention.
<p/>Inwardly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have suffered torture; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little home, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat courteously to any lady who looked inside.
<p/>It may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the inward meaning of it leaked out, and the great heart of the public was touched.
<p/>Crowds followed the cab, cheering it lustily; charming girls scaled it to get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) autograph; interviews appeared in the better class of papers, and society invited him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to dinner and added, <div class="bookquote">``Do come in the kennel.
<p/>Now that we look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) closely and remember the gaiety of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in the old days, all gone now just because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) babes, I find I won't be able to say nasty things about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) after all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>On that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery awaiting George's return home; a very sad-eyed woman. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was too fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) rubbishy children, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) couldn't help it.
<p/>Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) chair, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) has fallen asleep. The corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) mouth, where one looks first, is almost withered up.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) hand moves restlessly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) breast as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had a pain there. Some like Peter best, and some like Wendy best, but I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) best.
<p/>They are really within two miles of the window now, and flying strong, but all we need whisper is that they are on the way.
<p/>It is a pity we did it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) has started up, calling their names; and there is no one in the room but Nana.
<p/>Suppose, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) happy, we whisper to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) sleep that the brats are coming back. Let's. '' O Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back.
<p/>Nana had filmy eyes, but all she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) could do was put her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) paw gently on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) mistress's lap; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was brought back.
<p/>As Mr. Darling puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) head out to kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) wife, we see that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) had no imagination, and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man.
<p/>'' Outside, the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was naturally not unmoved. <div class="bookquote">``Listen to them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it is very gratifying.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There were several adults to-day,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) with a faint flush; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) head he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not a word of reproof for her (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>).
<p/>For some time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling of this success, and pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) hand reassuringly when she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) hoped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head would not be turned by it.
<p/>'' Lots of little boys,'' sneered Liza. '' Social success had not spoilt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); it had made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sweeter. '' But if I had been a weak man,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Good heavens, if I had been a weak man! '' '' And, George,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) said timidly, <div class="bookquote">``you are as full of remorse as ever, aren't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in a kennel.'' '' But it is punishment, isn't it, George?
<p/>You are sure you are not enjoying it? '' <div class="bookquote">``My love! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>You may be sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) begged his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) curled round in the kennel.
<p/>'' Won't you play me to sleep,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``on the nursery piano? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) was crossing to the day-nursery he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) added thoughtlessly, <div class="bookquote">``And shut that window.
<p/>I feel a draught.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left open for them, always, always.
<p/>Now it was his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) turn to beg her (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) pardon; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) went into the day-nursery and played, and soon he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was asleep; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) slept, Wendy and John and Michael flew into the room.
<p/>We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement planned by them before we left the ship; but something must have happened since then, for it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter and Tinker Bell.
<p/>Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) will think her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) mother has barred her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) out; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) will have to go back with me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh no. Peter's first words tell all. '' Quick Tink,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``close the window; bar it! That's right. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had exterminated the pirates he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the children to the mainland.
<p/>Instead of feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was behaving badly he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) danced with glee; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing.
<p/>This trick had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) head all the time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) whispered to Tink, <div class="bookquote">``It's Wendy's mother! She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as my mother.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my mother's was. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) knew nothing whatever about his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mother; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sometimes bragged about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did not know the tune, which was <div class="bookquote">``Home, Sweet Home,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) knew it was saying, <div class="bookquote">``Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) cried exultantly, <div class="bookquote">``You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is barred!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) saw that Mrs. Darling had laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) head on the box, and that two tears were sitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) wants me to unbar the window,'' thought Peter, <div class="bookquote">``but I won't, not I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had taken their place.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>)'s awfully fond of Wendy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) now for not seeing why she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could not have Wendy.
<p/>The reason was so simple: <div class="bookquote">``I'm fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) too. We can't both have her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>), lady. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>But the lady would not make the best of it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was unhappy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) skipped about and made funny faces, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) stopped it was just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), knocking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) ceased to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), but even then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not let go of him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). '' Oh, all right,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said at last, and gulped.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, Tink,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried, with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature; <div class="bookquote">``we don't want any silly mothers;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) flew away.
<p/>Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all, which of course was more than they deserved.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) unbarred the window. They alighted on the floor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) home.
<p/>'' John,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, looking around him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) doubtfully, <div class="bookquote">``I think I have been here before. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course you have, you silly.
<p/>There is your old bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div>'' So it is,'' Michael said, but not with much conviction. '' I say,'' cried John, <div class="bookquote">``the kennel!''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) dashed across to look into it.
<p/>'' Perhaps Nana is inside it,'' Wendy said. But John whistled. '' Hullo,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there's a man inside it. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not so big as the pirate I killed,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said with such frank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have been sad if those had been the first words he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) little Michael say.
<p/>'' It's father! '' exclaimed Wendy. <div class="bookquote">``Let me see father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div>Michael begged eagerly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) took a good look. '' Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the kennel.
<p/>'' Surely,'' said John, like one who had lost faith in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) memory, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) used not to sleep in the kennel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>Wendy said falteringly, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps we don't remember the old life as well as we thought we did. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>A chill fell upon them; and serve them right.
<p/>'' It is very careless of mother,'' said that young scoundrel John, <div class="bookquote">``not to be here when we come back. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div><p/>It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again. '' It's mother! '' cried Wendy, peeping. '' So it is!'' said John.
<p/>'' Then are you not really our mother, Wendy? '' asked Michael, who was surely sleepy. '' Oh dear! '' exclaimed Wendy, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) first real twinge of remorse -LSB-for having gone-RSB-, <div class="bookquote">``it was quite time we came back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us creep in,''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>John suggested, <div class="bookquote">``and put our hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) eyes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>But Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently, had a better plan.
<p/>Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) comes in, just as if we had never been away.
<p/>And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) husband was asleep, all the beds were occupied.
<p/>'' '' The children waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) cry of joy, but it did not come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) saw them, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) did not believe they were there.
<p/>You see, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) saw them in their beds so often in her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) dreams that she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) thought this was just the dream hanging around her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) still.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had nursed them. They could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them.
<p/>'' Mother!'' Wendy cried. '' That's Wendy,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was sure it was the dream. '' Mother!'' ''
<p/>That's Michael,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again.
<p/>Yes, they did, they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of bed and run to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>That's John,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said. '' Mother!'' cried Michael. He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) now. '' '' George, George! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) cried when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) could speak; and Mr. Darling woke to share her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) bliss, and Nana came rushing in.
<p/>There could not have been a lovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who was staring in at the window.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know; but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was looking through the window at the one joy from which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must be for ever barred.
<p/>They were waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they had counted five hundred they went up.
<p/>Chapter 17 WHEN WENDY GREW UP I hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They went up by the stair, because they thought this would make a better impression.
<p/>They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off, and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes.
<p/>They said nothing, but their eyes asked her (<font color='blue'><b>WENDY</b></font>) to have them. They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also, but they forgot about him (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>).
<p/>Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) would have them; but Mr. Darling was curiously depressed, and they saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) considered six a rather large number.
<p/>I must say,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) said to Wendy, <div class="bookquote">``that you don't do things by halves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them.
<p/>The first twin was the proud one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) asked, flushing, <div class="bookquote">``Do you think we should be too much of a handful, sir?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Because, if so, we can go away.'' <div class="bookquote">``Father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was behaving unworthily, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) could not help it.
<p/>'' We could lie doubled up,'' said Nibs. '' I always cut their hair myself,'' said Wendy. <div class="bookquote">``George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Darling</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was as glad to have them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) thought they should have asked his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) consent as well as hers, instead of treating him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) as a cypher -LSB-zero-RSB- in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own house.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) burst into tears, and the truth came out. '' I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is a cypher,'' Tootles cried instantly.
<p/>'' Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is a cypher, Curly?'' '' No, I don't. Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is a cypher, Slightly?''
<p/>It turned out that not one of them thought him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) a cypher; and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was absurdly gratified, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would find space for them all in the drawing-room if they fitted in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather not. Twin, what do you think? ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' We'll fit in, sir,'' they assured him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). '' Then follow the leader,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cried gaily.
<p/>Mind you, I am not sure that we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it's all the same.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went off dancing through the house, and they all cried <div class="bookquote">``Hoop la!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and danced after him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), searching for the drawing-room; and I forget whether they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all fitted in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not exactly come to the window, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brushed against it in passing so that she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could open it if she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) liked and call to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).
<p/>'' Hoop la!'' As for Peter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) saw Wendy once again before he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) flew away. That is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) did. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't feel, Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said falteringly, <div class="bookquote">``that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Hullo, Wendy, good-bye,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said. '' Oh dear, are you going away?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About me, Peter?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Darling</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) was keeping a sharp eye on Wendy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) told Peter that she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) had adopted all the other boys, and would like to adopt him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) also. '' Would you send me to school?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) inquired craftily. '' Yes.'' '' And then to an office?'' <div class="bookquote">``I suppose so. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Soon I would be a man?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very soon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to go to school and learn solemn things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) passionately. '' I don't want to be a man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>said Wendy the comforter, <div class="bookquote">``I should love you in a beard;''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. Darling stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) arms to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) repulsed her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>).
<p/>O Wendy's mother, if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard!'' '' Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.''
<p/>'' But where are you going to live?'' <div class="bookquote">``With Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How lovely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) grip. '' I thought all the fairies were dead,'' Mrs. Darling said.
<p/>There are always a lot of young ones,'' explained Wendy, who was now quite an authority, <div class="bookquote">``because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies.
<p/>They live in nests on the tops of trees; and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I shall have such fun,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>said Peter, with eye on Wendy. '' It will be rather lonely in the evening,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``sitting by the fire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have Tink.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tink can't go a twentieth part of the way round,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) a little tartly. ''
<p/>Sneaky tell-tale!'' Tink called out from somewhere round the corner. '' It doesn't matter,'' Peter said. '' O Peter, you know it matters.
<p/>'' '' Well, then, come with me to the little house. '' '' May I, mummy?'' <div class="bookquote">``Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, all right,'' Peter said, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) from politeness merely; but Mrs. Darling saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mouth twitch, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) made this handsome offer: to let Wendy go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) for a week every year to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) spring cleaning.
<p/>Wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement; and it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) that spring would be long in coming; but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had no sense of time, and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) is only a halfpenny-worth of them.
<p/>I suppose it was because Wendy knew this that her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) last words to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) were these rather plaintive ones: <div class="bookquote">``You won't forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time comes?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>these ones</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) does so need a mother.'' '' So do you, my love.'' '' '' Of course Peter promised; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) flew away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) took Mrs. Darling's kiss with him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite easily. Funny.
<p/>Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class III, but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. Class
<p/>Before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island; but it was too late now, and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor -LSB-
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Darling</b></font>) seemed satisfied. I is the top class. the younger Jenkins-RSB-. It is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually left them.
<p/>At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night; and one of their diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses -LSB-the English double-deckers-RSB-; but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when they let go of the bus.
<p/>In time they could not even fly after their hats. Want of practice, they called it; but what it really meant was that they no longer believed.
<p/>Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>); so he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was with Wendy when Peter came for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) at the end of the first year.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) flew away with Peter in the frock she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had woven from leaves and berries in the Neverland, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) one fear was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) might notice how short it had become; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) never noticed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had so much to say about himself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had looked forward to thrilling talks with him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) about old times, but new adventures had crowded the old ones from his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mind.
<p/>'' Who is Captain Hook? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) asked with interest when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) spoke of the arch enemy. '' Don't you remember,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) asked, amazed, <div class="bookquote">``how you killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) and saved all our lives?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Who is Tinker Bell?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forget them after I kill them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tinker</b></font>) replied carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``O Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) said, shocked; but even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) explained he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could not remember.
<p/>I expect he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was right, for fairies don't live long, but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them.
<p/>Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to Peter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops.
<p/>'' There are such a lot of them,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said. '' I expect she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) is no more. '' Next year he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did not come for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) never came. '' Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) is ill,'' Michael said.
<p/>'' You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) is never ill. '' Michael came close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) and whispered, with a shiver, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps there is no such person, Wendy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Michael</b></font>)</div><p/>and then Wendy would have cried if Michael had not been crying. Peter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) never knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had missed a year.
<p/>For a little longer she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) tried for his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sake not to have growing pains; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was untrue to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) got a prize for general knowledge.
<p/>But the years came and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met again Wendy was a married woman, and Peter was no more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) than a little dust in the box in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) toys.
<p/>That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). Wendy was grown up. You need not be sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was one of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) grew up of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) own free will a day quicker than other girls.
<p/>All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them.
<p/>You may see the twins and Nibs and Curly any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag and an umbrella.
<p/>Michael is an engine-driver -LSB-train engineer-RSB-. Slightly married a lady of title, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) became a lord. You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door?
<p/>That used to be Tootles. The bearded man who doesn't know any story to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children was once John. Wendy was married in white with a pink sash.
<p/>It is strange to think that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns -LSB-formal announcement of a marriage-RSB-. Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) arrived on the mainland she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) wanted to ask questions.
<p/>This ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) loved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) all she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place.
<p/>It was Jane's nursery now, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) father had bought it at the three per cents -LSB-mortgage rate-RSB- from Wendy's father, who was no longer fond of stairs.
<p/>There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane's and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) nurse's; and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) died of old age, and at the end she (<font color='blue'><b>Nana</b></font>) had been rather difficult to get on with; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself.
<p/>Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten. Once a week Jane's nurse had her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) evening off; and then it was Wendy's part to put Jane to bed.
<p/>It was Jane's invention to raise the sheet over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother's head and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own, thus making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper: <div class="bookquote">``What do we see now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I see anything to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>says Wendy, with a feeling that if Nana were here she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) would object to further conversation.
<p/>That was the time for stories. '' Yes, you do,'' says Jane, <div class="bookquote">``you see when you were a little girl. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That is a long time ago, sweetheart,'' says Wendy. '' Ah me, how time flies!'' <div class="bookquote">``Does it fly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>asks the artful child, <div class="bookquote">``the way you flew when you were a little girl?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever did really fly. '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you did.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' The dear old days when I could fly! '' <div class="bookquote">``Why can't you fly now, mother? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Because I am grown up, dearest.
<p/>When people grow up they forget the way. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why do they forget the way?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless.
<p/>It is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and innocent and heartless.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>Or perhaps Wendy admits she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) does see something. '' I do believe,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``that it is this nursery.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do believe it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>says Jane.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Pan/PETER</b></font>)</div>They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew in looking for his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) shadow.
<p/>The foolish fellow,'' says Wendy, <div class="bookquote">``tried to stick it on with soap, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) could not he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``You have missed a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>interrupts Jane, who now knows the story better than her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother. '' When you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sitting on the floor crying, what did you say?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I sat up in bed and I said, `Boy, why are you crying?'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that was it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>says Jane, with a big breath.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaids' lagoon, and the home under the ground, and the little house.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes! which did you like best of all?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think I liked the home under the ground best of all.
<p/>The last thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) ever said to me was, `Just always be waiting for me, and then some night you will hear me crowing.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' But, alas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) forgot all about me,'' Wendy said it with a smile.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was as grown up as that. '' What did his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) crow sound like? '' Jane asked one evening. '' It was like this,'' Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter's crow.
<p/>No, it wasn't,'' Jane said gravely, <div class="bookquote">``it was like this;''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did it ever so much better than her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother.
<p/>'' Wendy was a little startled. '' My darling, how can you know?'' <div class="bookquote">``I often hear it when I am sleeping,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>Jane said.
<p/>'' Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only one who heard it awake.
<p/>It was the spring of the year, and the story had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) bed.
<p/>Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sat darning she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heard a crow.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Lucky you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane. And then one night came the tragedy. Then the window blew open as of old, and Peter dropped in on the floor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) still had all his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) first teeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was a little boy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was grown up.
<p/>Hullo, Wendy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said, not noticing any difference, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was thinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) white dress might have been the nightgown in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) first.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) huddled by the fire not daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman. '' '' Hullo, Peter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as possible.
<p/>Something inside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was crying <div class="bookquote">``Woman, Woman, let go of me.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>'' Hullo, where is John? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked, suddenly missing the third bed. ''
<p/>John is not here now,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) gasped. '' Is Michael asleep? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) asked, with a careless glance at Jane. ''
<p/>Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) answered; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was untrue to Jane as well as to Peter. '' That is not Michael,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).
<p/>Peter looked. '' Hullo, is it a new one?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Boy or girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Girl. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Now surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would understand; but not a bit of it.
<p/>'' Peter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Girl</b></font>) said, faltering, <div class="bookquote">``are you expecting me to fly away with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course; that is why I have come.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) added a little sternly, <div class="bookquote">``Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Girl</b></font>) knew it was useless to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) had let many spring cleaning times pass.
<p/>'' I can't come,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Girl</b></font>) said apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``I have forgotten how to fly.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll soon teach you again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O Peter, don't waste the fairy dust on me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). '' What is it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried, shrinking. ''
<p/>I will turn up the light,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and then you can see for yourself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For almost the only time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) life that I know of, Peter was afraid.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was not a little girl heart-broken about him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was a grown woman smiling at it all, but they were wet-eyed smiles.
<p/>'' Don't turn up the light,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried. She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) turned up the light, and Peter saw.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) gave a cry of pain; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) arms he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) drew back sharply.
<p/>'' What is it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) cried again. She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>). '' I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty.
<p/>I grew up long ago. '' <div class="bookquote">``You promised not to!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help it. I am a married woman, Peter.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>No, you're not. '' '' Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby. '' '' No, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s not.
<p/>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) took a step towards the sleeping child with his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) dagger upraised. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did not strike.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sat down on the floor instead and sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) could have done it so easily once.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) was only a woman now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) ran out of the room to try to think. Peter continued to cry, and soon his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sobs woke Jane.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sat up in bed, and was interested at once. '' Boy,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``why are you crying?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Peter rose and bowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) bowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) from the bed.
<p/>'' Hullo,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said. '' Hullo,'' said Jane. '' My name is Peter Pan,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). '' Yes, I know.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I came back for my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pan</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``to take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to the Neverland.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>Jane said, <div class="bookquote">``I have been waiting for you.
<p/>When Wendy returned diffidently she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) found Peter sitting on the bed-post crowing gloriously, while Jane in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood by his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) side, with the look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).
<p/>Yes, I know,'' Wendy admitted rather forlornly; <div class="bookquote">``no one knows it so well as I.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wendy/WENDY</b></font>)</div>said Peter to Wendy; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) rose in the air, and the shameless Jane rose with him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>);
<p/>'' '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) does so need a mother,'' Jane said. '' it was already her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) easiest way of moving about.
<p/>Wendy rushed to the window. '' No, no,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) cried. '' It is just for spring cleaning time,'' Jane said, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) wants me always to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) spring cleaning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>'' If only I could go with you,'' Wendy sighed. '' You see you can't fly,'' said Jane. Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together.
<p/>Our last glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) at the window, watching them receding into the sky until they were as small as stars.
<p/>As you look at Wendy, you may see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) hair becoming white, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wendy</b></font>) figure little again, for all this happened long ago.
<p/>Jane is now a common grown-up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring cleaning time, except when he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) forgets, Peter comes for Margaret and takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to the Neverland, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) stories about himself, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) listens eagerly.
<p/>When Margaret grows up she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) will have a daughter, who is to be Peter's mother in turn; and thus it will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.
