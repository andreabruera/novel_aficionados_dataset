she sends pack of wolves to tear them to pieces but the tin_woodman kills them with his axe she sends wild crows to peck their eye out but the scarecrow kills them by breaking their necks

instantly she begins whirling through the air and rolling on the grass of the kansas prairie up to the farmhouse she runs to aunt em saying i so glad to be home again
the design was lavish for the time with illustrations on many pages backgrounds in different colors and several color plate illustrations
in september the grand rapids herald wrote that denslow illustrations are quite as much of the story as in the writing
the editorial opined that had it not been for denslow pictures the readers would be unable to picture precisely the figures of dorothy toto and the other characters
the distinctive look led to imitators at the time most notably eva katherine gibson zauberlinda the wise witch which mimicked both the typography and the illustration design of oz
the typeface was the newly designed monotype old style denslow illustrations were so well known that merchants of many products obtained permission to use them to promote their wares
the forms of the scarecrow the tin_woodman the cowardly lion the wizard and dorothy were made into rubber and metal sculptures
costume jewelry mechanical toys and soap were also designed using their figures a new edition of the book appeared in with illustrations by evelyn copelman
although it was claimed that the new illustrations were based on denslow originals they more closely resemble the characters as seen in the famous film version of baum book
dorothy meets the cowardly lion from the first edition baum acknowledged the influence of the brothers grimm and hans christian andersen which he was deliberately revising in his american fairy tales to include the wonder without the horrors
local legend has it that oz also known as the emerald city was inspired by prominent castle like building in the community of castle park near holland michigan where baum lived during the summer
the yellow brick road was derived from road at that time paved by yellow bricks located in peekskill new york where baum attended the peekskill military academy
the land of oz and other locations baum scholars often refer to the chicago world fair the white city as an inspiration for the emerald city
other legends suggest that the inspiration came from the hotel del coronado near san diego california baum was frequent guest at the hotel and had written several of the oz books there
some critics have suggested that baum may have been inspired by australia relatively new country at the time of the book original publication
baum said that the name oz came from his file cabinet labeled z australia is often colloquially spelled or referred to as oz
furthermore in ozma of oz dorothy gets back to oz as the result of storm at sea while she and uncle_henry are traveling by ship to australia
one might imagine that baum intended oz to be australia or perhaps magical land in the center of the great australian desert
like australia oz is an island continent somewhere to the west of california with inhabited regions bordering on great desert another influence lay in lewis carroll alice adventures in wonderland
a september review in the grand rapids herald called the wonderful wizard of oz veritable alice in wonderland brought up to the present day standard of juvenile literature
baum found carroll plots incoherent but he identified the books source of popularity as alice herself child with whom the child readers could identify this influenced his choice of protagonist
carroll rejected the victorian era ideology that children books should be saturated with morals instead believing that children should be allowed to be children
building on carroll style of numerous images accompanying the text baum combined the conventional features of fairy tale witches and wizards with the well known things in his readers lives scarecrows and cornfields
the wonderful wizard of oz is considered the first american fairy tale because of its references to clear american locations such as kansas and omaha
baum agreed with authors such as carroll that fantasy literature was important for children along with numerous illustrations but he also wanted to create story that had recognizable american elements in it such as farming and industrialization
baum was also influenced by carroll belief that children books should have many pictures and be pleasurable to read many of the characters props and ideas in the novel were drawn from baum experiences
as child baum frequently had nightmares of scarecrow pursuing him across field moments before the scarecrow ragged hay fingers nearly gripped his neck it would fall apart before his eye
decades later as an adult baum integrated his tormentor into the novel as the scarecrow according to his son harry the tin_woodman was born from baum attraction to window displays
he wished to make something captivating for the window displays so he used an eclectic assortment of scraps to craft striking figure
from washboiler he made body from bolted stovepipes he made arm and legs and from the bottom of saucepan he made face
john rockefeller was the nemesis of baum father an oil baron who declined to purchase standard oil shares in exchange for selling his own oil refinery
baum then placed funnel hat on the figure which ultimately became the tin_woodman baum scholar evan i schwartz posited that rockefeller inspired one of the wizard numerous faces
when rockefeller was years old the medical condition alopecia caused him to lose every strand of hair on his head making people fearful of speaking to him
in the early baum play matches was being performed when flicker from kerosene lantern sparked the rafters causing the baum opera house to be consumed by flames
in one scene in the novel the wizard is seen as tyrannical hairless head scholar evan i schwartz suggested that this might have inspired the scarecrow severest terror
in baum lived in aberdeen dakota territory which was experiencing drought and he wrote witty story in his our landlady column in aberdeen the saturday pioneer about farmer who gave green goggles to his horses causing them to believe that the wood chips that they were eating were pieces of grass
similarly the wizard made the people in the emerald city wear green goggles so that they would believe that their city was built from emeralds
there is only one thing in the world am afraid of during baum short stay in aberdeen the dissemination of myths about the plentiful west continued
however the west instead of being wonderland turned into wasteland because of drought and depression in baum moved his family from south dakota to chicago
at that time chicago was getting ready for the world columbian exposition in scholar laura barrett stated that chicago was considerably more akin to oz than to kansas
after discovering that the myths about the west incalculable riches were baseless baum created an extension of the american frontier in oz
in many respects baum creation is similar to the actual frontier save for the fact that the west was still undeveloped at the time
the munchkins dorothy encounters at the beginning of the novel represent farmers as do the winkies she later meets baum wife frequently visited her niece dorothy louise gage
when the baby whom maud adored as the daughter she never had died she was devastated and needed to consume medicine
the infant became gravely sick and died on november from congestion of the brain at exactly five months to assuage her distress frank made his protagonist of the wonderful wizard of oz female named dorothy
uncle_henry was modeled after uncle_henry gage his wife maud father bossed around by his wife matilda uncle_henry rarely dissented with her
he flourished in business though and his neighbors looked up to him likewise uncle_henry was passive but hard working man who looked stern and solemn and rarely spoke
the witches in the novel were influenced by witch hunting research gathered by baum mother in law matilda the stories of barbarous acts against accused witches scared baum
baum held different jobs moved lot and was exposed to many people so the inspiration for the story could have been taken from many different aspects of his life
in the introduction to the story baum writes that it aspires to being modernized fairy tale in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heart aches and nightmares are left out
two key events in the novel involve wicked witches who both meet their death through metaphorical means this is one of the explanations that he gives for the inspiration for the wonderful wizard of oz
the original illustrator of the novel w denslow could also have influenced the story and the way it has been interpreted
baum and denslow had close working relationship and worked together to create the presentation of the story through the images and the text
color is an important element of the story and is present throughout the images with each chapter having different color representation
baum former salesman of china wrote in chapter about china that had sprung to life denslow also added characteristics to his drawings that baum never described
in the later oz books john neill who illustrated all of the sequels continued to include these faces on gates
see also political interpretations of the wonderful wizard of oz baum did not offer any conclusive proof that he intended his novel to be political allegory
historian ranjit dighe wrote that for years after the book publication virtually nobody had such an interpretation until uncle_henry littlefield high school teacher
for example denslow drew house and the gates of the emerald city with faces on them littlefield posited that the book contained an allegory of the late century bimetallism debate regarding monetary policy
the wonderful wizard of oz has become an established part of multiple cultures spreading from its early young american readership to becoming known throughout the world
littlefield thesis achieved some support but has been strenuously attacked by others it has been translated or adapted into well over fifty languages at time being modified in local variations
in russia translation by alexander melentyevich volkov produced six books the wizard of the emerald city series which became progressively distanced from the baum version as ellie and her dog totoshka travel throughout the magic land
the film adaptation has become classic of popular culture shown annually on american television from to and then several time year every year beginning in
more recently the story has become an american stage production with an all black cast set in the context of modern african american culture
for instance in some abridged indian editions the tin_woodman was replaced with horse this last story of the wizard is ingeniously woven out of commonplace material
it is of course an extravaganza but will surely be found to appeal strongly to child readers as well as to the younger children to whom it will be read by mothers or those having charge of the entertaining of children
there seems to be an inborn love of stories in child minds and one of the most familiar and pleading requests of children is to be told another story
the drawing as well as the introduced color work vies with the texts drawn and the result has been book that rises far above the average children book of today high as is the present standard
enough stirring adventure enters into it however to flavor it with zest and it will indeed be strange if there be normal child who will not enjoy the story
the book has bright and joyous atmosphere and does not dwell upon killing and deeds of violence the wonderful wizard of oz received positive critical reviews upon release
in september review the new york time praised the novel writing that it would appeal to child readers and to younger children who could not read yet
during the first years after the wonderful wizard of oz publication in it received little critical analysis from scholars of children literature
according to ruth berman of science fiction studies the lists of suggested reading published for juvenile readers never contained baum work
the lack of interest stemmed from the scholars misgivings about fantasy as well as to their belief that lengthy series had little literary merit
the review also praised the illustrations for being pleasant complement to the text it has frequently come under fire over the years
in the director of detroit libraries banned the wonderful wizard of oz for having no value for children of his day for supporting negativism and for bringing children minds to cowardly level
professor russel nye of michigan state university countered that if the message of the oz books love kindness and unselfishness make the world better place seems of no value today then maybe the time is ripe for reassess good many other things besides the detroit library approved list of children books
they based their opposition to the novel on its depicting benevolent witches and promoting the belief that integral human attributes were individually developed rather than god given
in seven fundamentalist christian families in tennessee opposed the novel inclusion in the public school syllabus and filed lawsuit one parent said i do not want my children seduced into godless supernaturalism
the judge ruled that when the novel was being discussed in class the parents were allowed to have their children leave the classroom
leonard everett fisher of the horn book magazine wrote in that oz has a timeless message from less complex era and it continues to resonate
other reasons included the novel teaching that females are equal to males and that animals are personified and can speak the challenge of valuing oneself during impending adversity has not fisher noted lessened during the prior years
in review bill delaney of salem press praised baum for giving children the opportunity to discover magic in the mundane things in their everyday lives
the library of congress has declared the wonderful wizard of oz to be america greatest and best loved homegrown fairytale also naming it the first american fantasy for children and one of the most read children books
he further commended baum for teaching millions of children to love reading during their crucial formative years the editions they published lacked most of the in text color and color plates of the original
it was not until the book entered the public domain in that new editions either with the original color plates or new illustrations proliferated
notable among them are the pennyroyal edition illustrated by barry moser which was reprinted by the university of california press and the annotated wizard of oz edited by michael patrick hearn which was published by w norton and included all the original color illustrations as well as supplemental artwork by denslow
other centennial editions included university press of kansas kansas centennial edition illustrated by michael mccurdy with black and white illustrations and robert sabuda pop up book
