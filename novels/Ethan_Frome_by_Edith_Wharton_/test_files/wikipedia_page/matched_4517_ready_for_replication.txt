$ethan_frome$ is book by american author edith wharton it is set in the fictitious town of $starkfield$ massachusetts the novel was adapted into film $ethan_frome$ in
the prologue which is neither named as such nor numbered opens with an unnamed male narrator spending winter in $starkfield$ while in the area on business
the novel is framed by the literary device of an extended flashback he spots limping quiet man around the village who is somehow compelling in his demeanor and carriage
$ethan_frome$ is described as the most striking figure in $starkfield$ the ruin of man with careless powerful look in spite of lameness checking each step like the jerk of chain
this is $ethan_frome$ who is local fixture of the community having been lifelong resident curious the narrator sets out to learn about him
he learns that $ethan_frome$ limp arose from having been injured in smash up twenty four years before but further details are not forthcoming and the narrator fails to learn much more from $ethan_frome$ fellow townspeople other than that $ethan_frome$ attempt at higher education decades before was thwarted by the sudden illness of his father following an injury forcing his return to the farm to assist his parents never to leave again
because people seem not to wish to speak other than in vague and general terms about $ethan_frome$ past the narrator curiosity grows but he learns little more
a severe snowstorm during one of their journeys forces $ethan_frome$ to allow the narrator to shelter at his home one #night#
chance circumstances arise that allow the narrator to hire $ethan_frome$ as his driver for week just as the two are entering $ethan_frome$ house the prologue ends
we then embark on the first chapter chapter i which takes place twenty four years prior the narration switches from the first person narrator of the prologue to limited third person narrator
in chapter i $ethan_frome$ is waiting outside church dance for $mattie_silver$ his wife cousin who has for year lived with $ethan_frome$ and his sickly wife $zeena$ zenobia in order to help out around the house and farm
$mattie_silver$ is given the occasional #night# off to entertain herself in town as partial recompense for helping care for the fromes and $ethan_frome$ has the duty of walking her home
passing the graveyard he thinks in an intense moment of foreshadowing that we ll always go on living here together and some day she ll lie there beside me
it also becomes clear that $zeena$ has observed enough to understand that he has these feelings and understandably she resents them
when $zeena$ leaves for an overnight visit to seek treatment for her various complaints and symptoms in neighboring town $ethan_frome$ is excited to have an evening alone with $mattie_silver$
during this evening the narrator reveals small actions that show that they each have feelings for the other including lingering of touching #hand# on the milk jug although neither openly declares their love
$mattie_silver$ makes supper and retrieves from high shelf $zeena$ treasured pickle dish which $zeena$ in symbol of her stingy nature never uses in order to protect it
$mattie_silver$ uses it to present $ethan_frome$ with simple supper and disaster ensues when the $ethan_frome$ cat jumps on the table and knocks it off shattering it beyond repair
$ethan_frome$ tries to help by setting the dish pieces neatly in the cupboard presenting the false impression of wholeness if not examined closely with plans to purchase some glue and fix it as soon as he can
it is quickly clear that $ethan_frome$ has deep feelings for $mattie_silver$ in the morning $ethan_frome$ hopes for more private #time# with $mattie_silver$ are foiled by the presence of his hired man
$ethan_frome$ then goes into town to buy glue for the broken pickle dish and upon his return finds that $zeena$ has also come home
there she informs $ethan_frome$ that she plans to send $mattie_silver$ away and has already hired another girl to replace her claiming that she needs someone more efficient because her health is failing more rapidly than ever
$ethan_frome$ is angry and frustrated to the point of panic by the thought of losing $mattie_silver$ and he is also worried for $mattie_silver$ who has no other place to go and no way to support herself in the world
$zeena$ retreats upstairs proclaiming her illness and refusing supper because she is not hungry he returns to the kitchen and joins $mattie_silver$ and tries to eat but he is distraught and suddenly blurts out
$mattie_silver$ reacts with shock but rapid acceptance trying to calm $ethan_frome$ while $ethan_frome$ becomes more agitated and begins to insist that he will not let her go
$zeena$ plans to send $mattie_silver$ away moments later they are interrupted by $zeena$ who has decided that she is hungry after all
after supper $zeena$ discovers the broken pickle dish and is heartbroken and enraged this betrayal cements her determination to send $mattie_silver$ away
$ethan_frome$ miserable at the thought of losing $mattie_silver$ and worried sick about her fate considers running away with $mattie_silver$ but he lacks the money to do so
he feels that he cannot abandon $zeena$ because he knows that she would neither be able to run the farm nor sell it the poor quality of the place has been discussed at several points in the story already
every plan he thinks of is impossible to carry out and he remains in despair and frantically trying to think of way to change this one more turn of events against his ability to have happy life
panicked $ethan_frome$ rushes into town to try to get cash advance from customer for load of lumber in order to have the money with which to abscond with $mattie_silver$
his plan is unhinged by guilt however when his customer wife expresses compassion understanding and empathy for $ethan_frome$ lot which has involved the repeated duty to care for others first his parents then his sickly wife
he realizes that of all people he cannot cheat this kindly woman and her husband out of money since she is one of the few people who have ever seemed to have seen or openly acknowledged $ethan_frome$ lifelong plight as well as his honor in fulfilling his duties
the next morning $zeena$ describes her specific and imminent plans for sending $mattie_silver$ on her way $ethan_frome$ returns to the farm and picks up $mattie_silver$ to take her to the train station
they stop at hill upon which they had once planned to go sledding and decide to sled together as way of delaying their sad parting after which they anticipate never seeing each other again
after their first run $mattie_silver$ suggests suicide pact that they go down again and steer the sled directly into tree so they will never be parted and so that they may spend their last moments together
$ethan_frome$ first refuses to go through with the plan but in his despair that mirrors $mattie_silver$ he ultimately agrees and they get on the sled clutching each other
on the way down vision of $zeena$ face startles $ethan_frome$ into swerving bit but he corrects their course and they crash headlong and at high speed into the elm tree
$ethan_frome$ is also injured and the reader is left to understand that this was the smash up that left $ethan_frome$ with permanent limp
the final chapter or epilogue again unnumbered like the prologue switches back to the first person narrator point of view of the prologue as $ethan_frome$ and his visitor the narrator enter the $ethan_frome$ household two decades later
the narrator hears complaining female voice and it is easy to assume that it belongs to the never happy $zeena$ but in the final twist of the story it emerges that it is in fact $mattie_silver$ who now lives with the fromes due to having been paralyzed in the accident
her misery over her plight and dependence has embittered and soured her and with roles reversed $zeena$ is now forced to care for her as well as $ethan_frome$
further illustrating the psychosomatic nature of most of $zeena$ previous complaints she has now found the strength through necessity to be the caregiver rather than being the invalid
in an agonizing irony $ethan_frome$ and $mattie_silver$ have gotten their wish to stay together but in mutual unhappiness and discontent with $mattie_silver$ helpless and paralyzed and with $zeena$ as constant presence between the two of them
the story of $ethan_frome$ had initially begun as french language composition that wharton had to write while studying the language in paris but several years later she took the story up again and transformed it into the novel it now is basing her sense of new england culture and place on her years of living at the mount her home in lenox massachusetts
she would read portions of her novel in progress each day to her good friend walter berry who was an international lawyer
wharton likely based the story of $ethan_frome$ and $mattie_silver$ sledding experience on an accident that she had heard about in in lenox massachusetts
$ethan_frome$ regains consciousness after the accident but $mattie_silver$ lies beside him cheeping in pain like small wounded animal five people total were involved in the real life accident four girls and one boy
they crashed into lamppost while sledding down courthouse hill in lenox a girl named hazel crosby was killed in the accident
wharton learned of the accident from one of the girls who survived kate spencer when the two became friends while both worked at the lenox library
kate spencer suffered from hip injury in the accident and also had facial injuries it is among the few works by wharton with rural setting
wharton found the notion of the tragic sledding crash to be irresistible as potential extended metaphor for the wrongdoings of secret love affair
lenox is also where wharton had traveled extensively and had come into contact with at least one of the victims of the accident victims of the accident are buried in graves nearby wharton family members
in her introduction to the novel wharton talks of the outcropping granite of new england the austerity of its land and the stoicism of its people
the connection between land and people is very much part of naturalism the environment is powerful shaper of man fate and the novel dwells insistently on the cruelty of $starkfield$ winters
edith wharton was able to write an appealing book and separate it from her other works where her characters in $ethan_frome$ are not of the elite upper class
however the problems that the characters endure are still consistently the same where the protagonist has to decide whether or not to fulfill their duty or follow their heart
the new york #time# called $ethan_frome$ a compelling and haunting story she began writing $ethan_frome$ in the early when she was still married
trilling wrote that the ending is terrible to contemplate but that the mind can do nothing with it can only endure it
jeffrey lilburn notes that some find the suffering endured by wharton characters is excessive and unjustified but others see the difficult moral questions addressed and note that it provides insightful commentary on the american economic and cultural realities that produced and allowed such suffering
the novel was criticized by lionel trilling as lacking in moral or ethical significance wharton was always careful to label $ethan_frome$ as tale rather than novel
critics did take note of this when reviewing the book elizabeth ammons compared the work to fairy tales she found story that is as moral as the classic fairy tale and that functions as realistic social criticism
comparing $mattie_silver$ and $zeena$ $ethan_frome$ ammons suggests that the matties will grow as frigid and crippled as the zeenas so long as such women remain isolated and dependent
wharton cripples $mattie_silver$ says lilburn but has her survive in order to demonstrate the cruelty of the culture surrounding women in that period
