<p/>If you know the post-office you must have seen Ethan Frome drive up to it, drop the reins on his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) hollow-backed bay and drag himself across the brick pavement to the white colonnade; and you must have asked who he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) was.
<p/>It was there that, several years ago, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) for the first time; and the sight pulled me up sharp.
<p/>Produced by Charles Aldarondo ETHAN FROME By Edith Wharton ETHAN FROME If you know Starkfield, Massachusetts, you know the post-office. Even then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wharton</b></font>) was the most striking figure in Starkfield, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wharton</b></font>) was but the ruin of a man.
<p/>It was not so much his (<font color='blue'><b>Wharton</b></font>) great height that marked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wharton</b></font>), for the <div class="bookquote">``natives''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>were easily singled out by their lank longitude from the stockier foreign breed: it was the careless powerful look he (<font color='blue'><b>Wharton</b></font>) had, in spite of a lameness checking each step like the jerk of a chain.
<p/>There was something bleak and unapproachable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wharton</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wharton</b></font>) was so stiffened and grizzled that I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Wharton</b></font>) for an old man and was surprised to hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not more than fifty-two.
<p/>I had this from Harmon Gow, who had driven the stage from Bettsbridge to Starkfield in pre-trolley days and knew the chronicle of all the families on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gow</b></font>) line.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gow</b></font>)'s looked that way ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gow</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Gow</b></font>) smash-up; and that's twenty-four years ago come next February,'' Harmon threw out between reminiscent pauses.
<p/>I gathered from the same informant--which, besides drawing the red gash across Ethan Frome's forehead, had so shortened and warped his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) right side that it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) a visible effort to take the few steps from his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) buggy to the post-office window.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) used to drive in from his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) farm every day at about noon, and as that was my own hour for fetching my mail
<p/>I often passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) in the porch or stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) while we waited on the motions of the distributing hand behind the grating.
<p/>I noticed that, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) came so punctually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) seldom received anything but a copy of the Bettsbridge Eagle, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) put without a glance into his (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) sagging pocket.
<p/>At intervals, however, the post-master would hand him (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) an envelope addressed to Mrs. Zenobia--or Mrs. Zeena--Frome, and usually bearing conspicuously in the upper left-hand corner the address of some manufacturer of patent medicine and the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) specific.
<p/>These documents my neighbour would also pocket without a glance, as if too much used to them to wonder at their number and variety, and would then turn away with a silent nod to the post-master.
<p/>Every one in Starkfield knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) a greeting tempered to his (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) own grave mien; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) taciturnity was respected and it was only on rare occasions that one of the older men of the place detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) for a word.
<p/>When this happened he (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) would listen quietly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) blue eyes on the speaker's face, and answer in so low a tone that his (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) words never reached me; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) would climb stiffly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) buggy, gather up the reins in his (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) left hand and drive slowly away in the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) farm.
<p/>I questioned Harmon, looking after Frome's retreating figure, and thinking how gallantly his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) lean brown head, with its shock of light hair, must have sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) strong shoulders before they were bent out of shape.
<p/>'' The <div class="bookquote">``smash-up ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it was-- '' It was a pretty bad smash-up? '' '' Wust kind,'' my informant assented. <div class="bookquote">``More'n enough to kill most men.
<p/>At the moment Ethan Frome, after climbing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) seat, had leaned over to assure himself of the security of a wooden box--also with a druggist's label on it--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) had placed in the back of the buggy, and I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) face as it probably looked when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) thought himself alone.
<p/>But the Fromes are tough. Ethan'll likely touch a hundred. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good God! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. '' That man touch a hundred?
<p/>Harmon drew a slab of tobacco from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) pocket, cut off a wedge and pressed it into the leather pouch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) was dead and in hell now!'' '' Guess he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>)'s been in Starkfield too many winters. Most of the smart ones get away.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Somebody had to stay and care for the folks. There warn't ever anybody but Ethan. Fust his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) father--then his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) mother--then his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And then the smash-up?'' Harmon chuckled sardonically. '' That's so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) had to stay then.'' <div class="bookquote">``I see. And since then they've had to care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harmon/Harmon Gow</b></font>)</div><p/>Harmon thoughtfully passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) tobacco to the other cheek. '' Oh, as to that: I guess it's always Ethan done the caring.
<p/>Though Harmon Gow developed the tale as far as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gow</b></font>) mental and moral reach permitted there were perceptible gaps between his (<font color='blue'><b>Gow</b></font>) facts, and I had the sense that the deeper meaning of the story was in the gaps.
<p/>'' But one phrase stuck in my memory and served as the nucleus about which I grouped my subsequent inferences: ``Guess he (<font color='blue'><b>Gow</b></font>)'s been in Starkfield too many winters.
<p/>Yet I had come in the degenerate day of trolley, bicycle and rural delivery, when communication was easy between the scattered mountain villages, and the bigger towns in the valleys, such as Bettsbridge and Shadd's Falls, had libraries, theatres and Y. M. C. A. halls to which the youth of the hills could descend for recreation.
<p/>But when winter shut down on Starkfield and the village lay under a sheet of snow perpetually renewed from the pale skies, I began to see what life there--or rather its negation--must have been in Ethan Frome's young manhood.
<p/>I had been sent up by my employers on a job connected with the big power-house at Corbury Junction, and a long-drawn carpenters' strike had so delayed the work that I found myself anchored at Starkfield--the nearest habitable spot--for the best part of the winter.
<p/>I chafed at first, and then, under the hypnotising effect of routine, gradually began to find a grim satisfaction in the life.
<p/>During the early part of my stay I had been struck by the contrast between the vitality of the climate and the deadness of the community.
<p/>Day by day, after the December snows were over, a blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light and air on the white landscape, which gave them back in an intenser glitter.
<p/>One would have supposed that such an atmosphere must quicken the emotions as well as the blood; but it seemed to produce no change except that of retarding still more the sluggish pulse of Starkfield.
<p/>When I had been there a little longer, and had seen this phase of crystal clearness followed by long stretches of sunless cold; when the storms of February had pitched their white tents about the devoted village and the wild cavalry of March winds had charged down to their support; I began to understand why Starkfield emerged from its six months' siege like a starved garrison capitulating without quarter.
<p/>Twenty years earlier the means of resistance must have been far fewer, and the enemy in command of almost all the lines of access between the beleaguered villages; and, considering these things, I felt the sinister force of Harmon's phrase: <div class="bookquote">``Most of the smart ones get away.
<p/>But if that were the case, how could any combination of obstacles have hindered the flight of a man like Ethan Frome?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Harmon/Harmon Gow</b></font>)</div>Before my own time there was up I had learned to know what that meant. '' During my stay at Starkfield I lodged with a middle-aged widow colloquially known as Mrs. Ned Hale.
<p/>Mrs. Hale's father had been the village lawyer of the previous generation, and <div class="bookquote">``lawyer Varnum's house,''  (<font color='red'><b>father the village lawyer lawyer</b></font>)</div>where my landlady still lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) mother, was the most considerable mansion in the village.
<p/>It stood at one end of the main street, its classic portico and small-paned windows looking down a flagged path between Norway spruces to the slim white steeple of the Congregational church.
<p/>It was clear that the Varnum fortunes were at the ebb, but the two women did what they could to preserve a decent dignity; and Mrs. Hale, in particular, had a certain wan refinement not out of keeping with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) pale old-fashioned house.
<p/>In the <div class="bookquote">``best parlour,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>with its black horse-hair and mahogany weakly illuminated by a gurgling Carcel lamp, I listened every evening to another and more delicately shaded version of the Starkfield chronicle.
<p/>It was not that Mrs. Ned Hale felt, or affected, any social superiority to the people about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>); it was only that the accident of a finer sensibility and a little more education had put just enough distance between herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) neighbours to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) to judge them with detachment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) was not unwilling to exercise this faculty, and I had great hopes of getting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) the missing facts of Ethan Frome's story, or rather such a key to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) character as should co-ordinate the facts I knew.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) mind was a store-house of innocuous anecdote and any question about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) acquaintances brought forth a volume of detail; but on the subject of Ethan Frome I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) unexpectedly reticent.
<p/>There was no hint of disapproval in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) reserve; I merely felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) an insurmountable reluctance to speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) affairs, a low <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I knew them both...
<p/>it was awful... ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>seeming to be the utmost concession that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) distress could make to my curiosity. So marked was the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) manner
<p/>, such depths of sad initiation did it imply, that, with some doubts as to my delicacy, I put the case anew to my village oracle, Harmon Gow; but got for my pains only an uncomprehending grunt.
<p/>Ruth Varnum was always as nervous as a rat; and, come to think of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Varnum</b></font>) was the first one to see 'em after they was picked up.
<p/>It happened right below lawyer Varnum's, down at the bend of the Corbury road, just round about the time that Ruth got engaged to Ned Hale.
<p/>'' The young folks was all friends, and I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) just can't bear to talk about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>)'s had troubles enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) own.
<p/>All the dwellers in Starkfield, as in more notable communities, had had troubles enough of their own to make them comparatively indifferent to those of their neighbours; and though all conceded that Ethan Frome's had been beyond the common measure, no one gave me an explanation of the look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) face which, as I persisted in thinking, neither poverty nor physical suffering could have put there.
<p/>Nevertheless, I might have contented myself with the story pieced together from these hints had it not been for the provocation of Mrs. Hale's silence, and--a little later--for the accident of personal contact with the man.
<p/>On my arrival at Starkfield, Denis Eady, the rich Irish grocer, who was the proprietor of Starkfield's nearest approach to a livery stable, had entered into an agreement to send me over daily to Corbury Flats, where I had to pick up my train for the Junction.
<p/>The illness spread to the other Starkfield stables and for a day or two I was put to it to find a means of transport.
<p/>Then Harmon Gow suggested that Ethan Frome's bay was still on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gow</b></font>) legs and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gow</b></font>) owner might be glad to drive me over.
<p/>'' But about the middle of the winter Eady's horses fell ill of a local epidemic. I stared at the suggestion.
<p/>'' Ethan Frome? But I've never even spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>). Why on earth should he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) put himself out for me? ''
<p/>Harmon's answer surprised me still more. '' I don't know as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) would; but I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) wouldn't be sorry to earn a dollar.
<p/>I had been told that Frome was poor, and that the saw-mill and the arid acres of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) farm yielded scarcely enough to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) household through the winter; but I had not supposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) to be in such want as Harmon's words implied, and I expressed my wonder.
<p/>When a man's been setting round like a hulk for twenty years or more, seeing things that want doing, it eats inter him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loses his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grit.
<p/>That Frome farm was always `bout as bare's a milkpan when the cat's been round; and you know what one of them old water-mills is wuth nowadays.
<p/>When Ethan could sweat over 'em both from sunup to dark he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) kinder choked a living out of 'em; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) folks ate up most everything, even then, and I don't see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) makes out now.
<p/>Fust his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) father got a kick, out haying, and went soft in the brain, and gave away money like Bible texts afore he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) died.
<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) mother got queer and dragged along for years as weak as a baby; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife Zeena, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s always been the greatest hand at doctoring in the county.
<p/>'' '' Well, matters ain't gone any too well with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>),'' Harmon said. '' Sickness and trouble: that's what Ethan's had his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) plate full up with, ever since the very first helping.
<p/>The next morning, when I looked out, I saw the hollow-backed bay between the Varnum spruces, and Ethan Frome, throwing back his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) worn bearskin, made room for me in the sleigh at his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) side.
<p/>After that, for a week, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) drove me over every morning to Corbury Flats, and on my return in the afternoon met me again and carried me back through the icy night to Starkfield.
<p/>The distance each way was barely three miles, but the old bay's pace was slow, and even with firm snow under the runners we were nearly an hour on the way.
<p/>Ethan Frome drove in silence, the reins loosely held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) left hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) brown seamed profile, under the helmet-like peak of the cap, relieved against the banks of snow like the bronze image of a hero.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) never turned his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) face to mine, or answered, except in monosyllables, the questions I put, or such slight pleasantries as I ventured.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) seemed a part of the mute melancholy landscape, an incarnation of its frozen woe, with all that was warm and sentient in him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) fast bound below the surface; but there was nothing unfriendly in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) silence.
<p/>I simply felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) lived in a depth of moral isolation too remote for casual access, and I had the sense that his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) loneliness was not merely the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) personal plight, tragic as I guessed that to be, but had in it, as Harmon Gow had hinted, the profound accumulated cold of many Starkfield winters.
<p/>Only once or twice was the distance between us bridged for a moment; and the glimpses thus gained confirmed my desire to know more.
<p/>Once I happened to speak of an engineering job I had been on the previous year in Florida, and of the contrast between the winter landscape about us and that in which I had found myself the year before; and to my surprise Frome said suddenly: <div class="bookquote">``Yes: I was down there once, and for a good while afterward I could call up the sight of it in winter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) said no more, and I had to guess the rest from the inflection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) voice and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) sharp relapse into silence.
<p/>Another day, on getting into my train at the Flats, I missed a volume of popular science--I think it was on some recent discoveries in bio-chemistry--which I had carried with me to read on the way.
<p/>I thought no more about it till I got into the sleigh again that evening, and saw the book in Frome's hand.
<p/>I put the volume into my pocket and we dropped back into our usual silence; but as we began to crawl up the long hill from Corbury Flats to the Starkfield ridge I became aware in the dusk that he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) face to mine.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>But now it's all snowed under. '' '' I found it after you were gone,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) said. '' There are things in that book that I didn't know the first word about,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) said.
<p/>I wondered less at his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) words than at the queer note of resentment in his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) was evidently surprised and slightly aggrieved at his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) own ignorance.
<p/>There are one or two rather new things in the book: there have been some big strides lately in that particular line of research.
<p/>I waited a moment for an answer that did not come; then I said: <div class="bookquote">``If you'd like to look the book through I'd be glad to leave it with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Does that sort of thing interest you? '' I asked. '' It used to.'' '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) hesitated, and I had the impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) felt himself about to yield to a stealing tide of inertia
<p/>; then, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you--I'll take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) answered shortly. I hoped that this incident might set up some more direct communication between us.
<p/>Frome was so simple and straightforward that I was sure his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) curiosity about the book was based on a genuine interest in its subject.
<p/>Such tastes and acquirements in a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condition made the contrast more poignant between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) outer situation and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inner needs, and I hoped that the chance of giving expression to the latter might at least unseal his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips.
<p/>But something in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) past history, or in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) present way of living, had apparently driven him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too deeply into himself for any casual impulse to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kind.
<p/>At our next meeting he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made no allusion to the book, and our intercourse seemed fated to remain as negative and one-sided as if there had been no break in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reserve.
<p/>Frome had been driving me over to the Flats for about a week when one morning I looked out of my window into a thick snow-fall.
<p/>The height of the white waves massed against the garden-fence and along the wall of the church showed that the storm must have been going on all night, and that the drifts were likely to be heavy in the open.
<p/>I thought it probable that my train would be delayed; but I had to be at the power-house for an hour or two that afternoon, and I decided, if Frome turned up, to push through to the Flats and wait there till my train came in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) was not the kind of man to be turned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) business by any commotion of the elements; and at the appointed hour his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) sleigh glided up through the snow like a stage-apparition behind thickening veils of gauze.
<p/>I was getting to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) too well to express either wonder or gratitude at his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) appointment; but I exclaimed in surprise as I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) horse in a direction opposite to that of the Corbury road.
<p/>The railroad's blocked by a freight-train that got stuck in a drift below the Flats,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) explained, as we jogged off into the stinging whiteness.
<p/>I don't know why I put it in the conditional, however, for I never doubted that Frome would appear. '' ''
<p/>But look here--where are you taking me, then?'' '' Straight to the Junction, by the shortest way,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) answered, pointing up School House Hill with his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) whip.
<p/>'' To the Junction--in this storm? Why, it's a good ten miles!'' '' The bay'll do it if you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) time.
<p/>You said you had some business there this afternoon. I'll see you get there. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) said it so quietly that I could only answer: <div class="bookquote">``You're doing me the biggest kind of a favour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Abreast of the schoolhouse the road forked, and we dipped down a lane to the left, between hemlock boughs bent inward to their trunks by the weight of the snow.
<p/>I had often walked that way on Sundays, and knew that the solitary roof showing through bare branches near the bottom of the hill was that of Frome's saw-mill.
<p/>It looked exanimate enough, with its idle wheel looming above the black stream dashed with yellow-white spume, and its cluster of sheds sagging under their white load.
<p/>Frome did not even turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) head as we drove by, and still in silence we began to mount the next slope.
<p/>About a mile farther, on a road I had never travelled, we came to an orchard of starved apple-trees writhing over a hillside among outcroppings of slate that nuzzled up through the snow like animals pushing out their noses to breathe.
<p/>Beyond the orchard lay a field or two, their boundaries lost under drifts; and above the fields, huddled against the white immensities of land and sky, one of those lonely New England farm-houses that make the landscape lonelier.
<p/>That's my place,'' said Frome, with a sideway jerk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) lame elbow; and in the distress and oppression of the scene I did not know what to answer.
<p/>The snow had ceased, and a flash of watery sunlight exposed the house on the slope above us in all its plaintive ugliness.
<p/>The black wraith of a deciduous creeper flapped from the porch, and the thin wooden walls, under their worn coat of paint, seemed to shiver in the wind that had risen with the ceasing of the snow.
<p/>The house was bigger in my father's time: I had to take down the `L,' a while back,'' Frome continued, checking with a twitch of the left rein the bay's evident intention of turning in through the broken-down gate.
<p/>I saw then that the unusually forlorn and stunted look of the house was partly due to the loss of what is known in New England as the <div class="bookquote">``L'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>: that long deep-roofed adjunct usually built at right angles to the main house, and connecting it, by way of storerooms and tool-house, with the wood-shed and cow-barn.
<p/>Whether because of its symbolic sense, the image it presents of a life linked with the soil, and enclosing in itself the chief sources of warmth and nourishment, or whether merely because of the consolatory thought that it enables the dwellers in that harsh climate to get to their morning's work without facing the weather, it is certain that the <div class="bookquote">``L''  (<font color='red'><b>the dwellers</b></font>)</div>rather than the house itself seems to be the centre, the actual hearth-stone of the New England farm.
<p/>Perhaps this connection of ideas, which had often occurred to me in my rambles about Starkfield, caused me to hear a wistful note in Frome's words, and to see in the diminished dwelling the image of his (<font color='blue'><b>dwellers</b></font>) own shrunken body.
<p/>We're kinder side-tracked here now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>dwellers</b></font>) added, ``but there was considerable passing before the railroad was carried through to the Flats.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>dwellers</b></font>) roused the lagging bay with another twitch; then, as if the mere sight of the house had let me too deeply into his (<font color='blue'><b>dwellers</b></font>) confidence for any farther pretence of reserve, he (<font color='blue'><b>dwellers</b></font>) went on slowly: <div class="bookquote">``I've always set down the worst of mother's trouble to that.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got the rheumatism so bad she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) couldn't move around she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to sit up there and watch the road by the hour; and one year, when they was six months mending the Bettsbridge pike after the floods, and Harmon Gow had to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Gow</b></font>) stage round this way
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That's all right,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gow</b></font>) rejoined. '' '' '' '' , she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) picked up so that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to get down to the gate most days to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gow</b></font>).
<p/>But after the trains begun running nobody ever come by here to speak of, and mother never could get it through her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head what had happened, and it preyed on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) right along till she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died.
<p/>As we turned into the Corbury road the snow began to fall again, cutting off our last glimpse of the house; and Frome's silence fell with it, letting down between us the old veil of reticence.
<p/>Instead, it sprang up to a gale which now and then, from a tattered sky, flung pale sweeps of sunlight over a landscape chaotically tossed.
<p/>But the bay was as good as Frome's word, and we pushed on to the Junction through the wild white scene.
<p/>In the afternoon the storm held off, and the clearness in the west seemed to my inexperienced eye the pledge of a fair evening.
<p/>I finished my business as quickly as possible, and we set out for Starkfield with a good chance of getting there for supper.
<p/>But at sunset the clouds gathered again, bringing an earlier night, and the snow began to fall straight and steadily from a sky without wind, in a soft universal diffusion more confusing than the gusts and eddies of the morning.
<p/>It seemed to be a part of the thickening darkness, to be the winter night itself descending on us layer by layer.
<p/>The small ray of Frome's lantern was soon lost in this smothering medium, in which even his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) sense of direction, and the bay's homing instinct, finally ceased to serve us.
<p/>Two or three times some ghostly landmark sprang up to warn us that we were astray, and then was sucked back into the mist; and when we finally regained our road the old horse began to show signs of exhaustion.
<p/>I felt myself to blame for having accepted Frome's offer, and after a short discussion I persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) to let me get out of the sleigh and walk along through the snow at the bay's side.
<p/>In this way we struggled on for another mile or two, and at last reached a point where Frome, peering into what seemed to me formless night, said: <div class="bookquote">``That's my gate down yonder.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>This time the wind did not cease with the return of the snow. '' The last stretch had been the hardest part of the way.
<p/>The bitter cold and the heavy going had nearly knocked the wind out of me, and I could feel the horse's side ticking like a clock under my hand.
<p/>'' Look here, Frome,'' I began, <div class="bookquote">``there's no earthly use in your going any farther--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) interrupted me: <div class="bookquote">``Nor you neither.
<p/>I understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) was offering me a night's shelter at the farm, and without answering I turned into the gate at his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) side, and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) to the barn, where I helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) to unharness and bed down the tired horse.
<p/>When this was done he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) unhooked the lantern from the sleigh, stepped out again into the night, and called to me over his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) shoulder:
<p/>There's been about enough of this for anybody. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This way. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Far off above us a square of light trembled through the screen of snow.
<p/>Staggering along in Frome's wake I floundered toward it, and in the darkness almost fell into one of the deep drifts against the front of the house.
<p/>Frome scrambled up the slippery steps of the porch, digging a way through the snow with his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) heavily booted foot. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) lantern, found the latch, and led the way into the house.
<p/>On our right a line of light marked the door of the room which had sent its ray across the night; and behind the door I heard a woman's voice droning querulously.
<p/>Frome stamped on the worn oil-cloth to shake the snow from his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) boots, and set down his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) lantern on a kitchen chair which was the only piece of furniture in the hall.
<p/>I went after him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) into a low unlit passage, at the back of which a ladder-like staircase rose into obscurity. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) opened the door.
<p/>It was that night that I found the clue to Ethan Frome, and began to put together this vision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) story.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) said; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) spoke the droning voice grew still... I The village lay under two feet of snow, with drifts at the windy corners.
<p/>The moon had set, but the night was so transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray against the snow, clumps of bushes made black stains on it, and the basement windows of the church sent shafts of yellow light far across the endless undulations.
<p/>Young Ethan Frome walked at a quick pace along the deserted street, past the bank and Michael Eady's new brick store and Lawyer Varnum's house with the two black Norway spruces at the gate.
<p/>Opposite the Varnum gate, where the road fell away toward the Corbury valley, the church reared its slim white steeple and narrow peristyle.
<p/>As the young man walked toward it the upper windows drew a black arcade along the side wall of the building, but from the lower openings, on the side where the ground sloped steeply down to the Corbury road, the light shot its long bars, illuminating many fresh furrows in the track leading to the basement door, and showing, under an adjoining shed, a line of sleighs with heavily blanketed horses.
<p/>In a sky of iron the points of the Dipper hung like icicles and Orion flashed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cold fires. The night was perfectly still, and the air so dry and pure that it gave little sensation of cold.
<p/>The effect produced on Frome was rather of a complete absence of atmosphere, as though nothing less tenuous than ether intervened between the white earth under his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) feet and the metallic dome overhead.
<p/>Four or five years earlier he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) had taken a year's course at a technological college at Worcester, and dabbled in the laboratory with a friendly professor of physics; and the images supplied by that experience still cropped up, at unexpected moments, through the totally different associations of thought in which he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) had since been living.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) father's death, and the misfortunes following it, had put a premature end to Ethan's studies; but though they had not gone far enough to be of much practical use they had fed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) fancy and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) aware of huge cloudy meanings behind the daily face of things.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) strode along through the snow the sense of such meanings glowed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) brain and mingled with the bodily flush produced by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) sharp tramp.
<p/>'' It's like being in an exhausted receiver,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) thought. At the end of the village he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) paused before the darkened front of the church.
<p/>The pitch of the Corbury road, below lawyer Varnum's spruces, was the favourite coasting-ground of Starkfield, and on clear evenings the church corner rang till late with the shouts of the coasters; but to-night not a sled darkened the whiteness of the long declivity.
<p/>The hush of midnight lay on the village, and all its waking life was gathered behind the church windows, from which strains of dance-music flowed with the broad bands of yellow light.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) stood there a moment, breathing quickly, and looking up and down the street, in which not another figure moved. The young man, skirting the side of the building, went down the slope toward the basement door.
<p/>To keep out of range of the revealing rays from within he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made a circuit through the untrodden snow and gradually approached the farther angle of the basement wall.
<p/>Thence, still hugging the shadow, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) edged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way cautiously forward to the nearest window, holding back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) straight spare body and craning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got a glimpse of the room.
<p/>Seen thus, from the pure and frosty darkness in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood, it seemed to be seething in a mist of heat.
<p/>The metal reflectors of the gas-jets sent crude waves of light against the whitewashed walls, and the iron flanks of the stove at the end of the hall looked as though they were heaving with volcanic fires.
<p/>Down the side wall facing the window stood a row of kitchen chairs from which the older women had just risen.
<p/>By this time the music had stopped, and the musicians--a fiddler, and the young lady who played the harmonium on Sundays--were hastily refreshing themselves at one corner of the supper-table which aligned its devastated pie-dishes and ice-cream saucers on the platform at the end of the hall.
<p/>The guests were preparing to leave, and the tide had already set toward the passage where coats and wraps were hung, when a young man with a sprightly foot and a shock of black hair shot into the middle of the floor and clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands.
<p/>The musicians hurried to their instruments, the dancers--some already half-muffled for departure--fell into line down each side of the room, the older spectators slipped back to their chairs, and the lively young man, after diving about here and there in the throng, drew forth a girl who had already wound a cherry-coloured <div class="bookquote">``fascinator''  (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div>about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head, and, leading her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) up to the end of the floor, whirled her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) down its length to the bounding tune of a Virginia reel.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been straining for a glimpse of the dark head under the cherry-coloured scarf and it vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that another eye should have been quicker than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The leader of the reel, who looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had Irish blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) veins, danced well, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) partner caught his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fire.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) passed down the line, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) light figure swinging from hand to hand in circles of increasing swiftness, the scarf flew off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head and stood out behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulders, and Frome, at each turn, caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) laughing panting lips, the cloud of dark hair about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forehead, and the dark eyes which seemed the only fixed points in a maze of flying lines.
<p/>The dancers were going faster and faster, and the musicians, to keep up with them, belaboured their instruments like jockeys lashing their mounts on the home-stretch; yet it seemed to the young man at the window that the reel would never end.
<p/>Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes from the girl's face to that of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) partner, which, in the exhilaration of the dance, had taken on a look of almost impudent ownership.
<p/>Denis Eady was the son of Michael Eady, the ambitious Irish grocer, whose suppleness and effrontery had given Starkfield its first notion of <div class="bookquote">``smart''  (<font color='red'><b>the grocer</b></font>)</div>business methods, and whose new brick store testified to the success of the attempt.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) son seemed likely to follow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) steps, and was meanwhile applying the same arts to the conquest of the Starkfield maidenhood.
<p/>The floor was thronged with girls and young men. The signal took instant effect. Frome's heart was beating fast. Hitherto Ethan Frome had been content to think him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) a mean fellow; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) positively invited a horse-whipping.
<p/>It was strange that the girl did not seem aware of it: that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could lift her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rapt face to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dancer's, and drop her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>), without appearing to feel the offence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) look and touch.
<p/>Frome was in the habit of walking into Starkfield to fetch home his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) wife's cousin, Mattie Silver, on the rare evenings when some chance of amusement drew her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to the village.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) wife who had suggested, when the girl came to live with them, that such opportunities should be put in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way.
<p/>Mattie Silver came from Stamford, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) entered the Fromes' household to act as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cousin Zeena's aid it was thought best, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came without pay, not to let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feel too sharp a contrast between the life she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had left and the isolation of a Starkfield farm.
<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wife first proposed that they should give Mattie an occasional evening out he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had inwardly demurred at having to do the extra two miles to the village and back after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hard day on the farm; but not long afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had reached the point of wishing that Starkfield might give all its nights to revelry.
<p/>Mattie Silver had lived under his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) roof for a year, and from early morning till they met at supper he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) had frequent chances of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); but no moments in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) company were comparable to those when, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) light step flying to keep time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) long stride, they walked back through the night to the farm.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) had taken to the girl from the first day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) had driven over to the Flats to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had smiled and waved to him (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) from the train, crying out,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be Ethan!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) jumped down with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bundles, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) reflected, looking over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slight person: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) don't look much on housework, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ain't a fretter, anyhow.
<p/>But for this--as Frome sardonically reflected--it would hardly have occurred to Zeena to take any thought for the girl's amusement. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>person</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was not only that the coming to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) house of a bit of hopeful young life was like the lighting of a fire on a cold hearth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had an eye to see and an ear to hear: he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) could show her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) things and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) things, and taste the bliss of feeling that all he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) imparted left long reverberations and echoes he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) could wake at will.
<p/>The girl was more than the bright serviceable creature he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). It was during their night walks back to the farm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) felt most intensely the sweetness of this communion.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) unfinished studies had given form to this sensibility and even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) unhappiest moments field and sky spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) with a deep and powerful persuasion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) had always been more sensitive than the people about him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) to the appeal of natural beauty. But hitherto the emotion had remained in him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) as a silent ache, veiling with sadness the beauty that evoked it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) did not even know whether any one else in the world felt as he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) did, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) was the sole victim of this mournful privilege.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) learned that one other spirit had trembled with the same touch of wonder: that at his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) side, living under his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) roof and eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) bread, was a creature to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) could say: <div class="bookquote">``That's Orion down yonder; the big fellow to the right is Aldebaran, and the bunch of little ones--like bees swarming--they're the Pleiades...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or whom he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could hold entranced before a ledge of granite thrusting up through the fern while he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) unrolled the huge panorama of the ice age, and the long dim stretches of succeeding time.
<p/>The fact that admiration for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) learning mingled with Mattie's wonder at what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) taught was not the least part of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pleasure.
<p/>And there were other sensations, less definable but more exquisite, which drew them together with a shock of silent joy: the cold red of sunset behind winter hills, the flight of cloud-flocks over slopes of golden stubble, or the intensely blue shadows of hemlocks on sunlit snow.
<p/>'' it seemed to Ethan that the art of definition could go no farther, and that words had at last been found to utter his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) secret soul....
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) once: ``It looks just as if it was painted! As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) stood in the darkness outside the church these memories came back with the poignancy of vanished things.
<p/>Watching Mattie whirl down the floor from hand to hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wondered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) could ever have thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) dull talk interested her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>The face she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lifted to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) dancers was the same which, when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>), always looked like a window that has caught the sunset.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) even noticed two or three gestures which, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) fatuity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had thought she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) kept for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>): a way of throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head back when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was amused, as if to taste her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) laugh before she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) let it out, and a trick of sinking her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lids slowly when anything charmed or moved her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>), who was never gay but in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) presence, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) gaiety seemed plain proof of indifference. The sight made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) unhappy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) unhappiness roused his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) latent fears.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wife had never shown any jealousy of Mattie, but of late she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had grumbled increasingly over the house-work and found oblique ways of attracting attention to the girl's inefficiency.
<p/>Zeena had always been what Starkfield called <div class="bookquote">``sickly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Starkfield</b></font>)</div>and Frome had to admit that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were as ailing as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) believed, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) needed the help of a stronger arm than the one which lay so lightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) during the night walks to the farm.
<p/>Mattie had no natural turn for housekeeping, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) training had done nothing to remedy the defect. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was quick to learn, but forgetful and dreamy, and not disposed to take the matter seriously.
<p/>Ethan had an idea that if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were to marry a man she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was fond of the dormant instinct would wake, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pies and biscuits become the pride of the county; but domesticity in the abstract did not interest her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so awkward that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not help laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) laughed with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and that made them better friends.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best to supplement her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) unskilled efforts, getting up earlier than usual to light the kitchen fire, carrying in the wood overnight, and neglecting the mill for the farm that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might help her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) about the house during the day.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even crept down on Saturday nights to scrub the kitchen floor after the women had gone to bed; and Zeena, one day, had surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the churn and had turned away silently, with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) queer looks.
<p/>One cold winter morning, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dressed in the dark, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) candle flickering in the draught of the ill-fitting window, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) speak from the bed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Of late there had been other signs of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) disfavour, as intangible but more disquieting. '' The doctor don't want I should be left without anybody to do for me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flat whine.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be asleep, and the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice had startled him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was given to abrupt explosions of speech after long intervals of secretive silence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) turned and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lay indistinctly outlined under the dark calico quilt, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) high-boned face taking a grayish tinge from the whiteness of the pillow.
<p/>'' Nobody to do for you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) repeated. '' If you say you can't afford a hired girl when Mattie goes.
<p/>Frome turned away again, and taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) razor stooped to catch the reflection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) stretched cheek in the blotched looking-glass above the wash-stand.
<p/>'' '' Why on earth should Mattie go?'' '' Well, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gets married, I mean,'' his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wife's drawl came from behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/>I wouldn't ever have it said that I stood in the way of a poor girl like Mattie marrying a smart fellow like Denis Eady,'' Zeena answered in a tone of plaintive self-effacement.
<p/>'' Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d never leave us as long as you needed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) returned, scraping hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) chin. '' Ethan, glaring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) face in the glass, threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) head back to draw the razor from ear to chin.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hand was steady, but the attitude was an excuse for not making an immediate reply. '' And the doctor don't want I should be left without anybody,'' Zeena continued.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wanted I should speak to you about a girl he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s heard about, that might come--'' Ethan laid down the razor and straightened himself with a laugh.
<p/>'' '' Denis Eady! If that's all, I guess there's no such hurry to look round for a girl. '' ''
<p/>Well, I'd like to talk to you about it,'' said Zeena obstinately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) was getting into his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) clothes in fumbling haste.
<p/>But I haven't got the time now; I'm late as it is,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) returned, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) old silver turnip-watch to the candle.
<p/>Zeena, apparently accepting this as final, lay watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) in silence while he (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) suspenders over his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) shoulders and jerked his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) arms into his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) coat; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) went toward the door she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, suddenly and incisively: <div class="bookquote">``I guess you're always late, now you shave every morning.
<p/>It was a fact that since Mattie Silver's coming he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) had taken to shaving every day; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) wife always seemed to be asleep when he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) side in the winter darkness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) had stupidly assumed that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not notice any change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) appearance.
<p/>Once or twice in the past he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) had been faintly disquieted by Zenobia's way of letting things happen without seeming to remark them, and then, weeks afterward, in a casual phrase, revealing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) had all along taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) notes and drawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) inferences.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>All right. '' That thrust had frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) more than any vague insinuations about Denis Eady. Of late, however, there had been no room in his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) thoughts for such vague apprehensions.
<p/>All his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) life was lived in the sight and sound of Mattie Silver, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) could no longer conceive of its being otherwise.
<p/>But now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) stood outside the church, and saw Mattie spinning down the floor with Denis Eady, a throng of disregarded hints and menaces wove their cloud about his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) brain.... II As the dancers poured out of the hall Frome, drawing back behind the projecting storm-door, watched the segregation of the grotesquely muffled groups, in which a moving lantern ray now and then lit up a face flushed with food and dancing.
<p/>The villagers, being afoot, were the first to climb the slope to the main street, while the country neighbours packed themselves more slowly into the sleighs under the shed.
<p/>Ain't you riding, Mattie?'' a woman's voice called back from the throng about the shed, and Ethan's heart gave a jump.
<p/>From where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) stood he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) could not see the persons coming out of the hall till they had advanced a few steps beyond the wooden sides of the storm-door; but through its cracks he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) heard a clear voice answer:
<p/>Zeena herself, from an oppressive reality, had faded into an insubstantial shade. '' <div class="bookquote">``Mercy no! Not on such a night. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In another moment she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would step forth into the night, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) eyes, accustomed to the obscurity, would discern her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as clearly as though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood in daylight.
<p/>A wave of shyness pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) back into the dark angle of the wall, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) stood there in silence instead of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) presence known to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>It had been one of the wonders of their intercourse that from the first, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), the quicker, finer, more expressive, instead of crushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) by the contrast, had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) something of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own ease and freedom; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) felt as heavy and loutish as in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) student days, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had tried to <div class="bookquote">``jolly''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the Worcester girls at a picnic.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was there, then, close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>), only a thin board between. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hung back, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came out alone and paused within a few yards of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was almost the last to leave the hall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood looking uncertainly about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as if wondering why he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) did not show himself.
<p/>Then a man's figure approached, coming so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that under their formless wrappings they seemed merged in one dim outline.
<p/>'' Gentleman friend gone back on you? Say, Matt, that's tough! No, I wouldn't be mean enough to tell the other girls.
<p/>I ain't as low-down as that. '' -LRB-How Frome hated his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) cheap banter!-RRB- '' But look at here, ain't it lucky
<p/>I got the old man's cutter down there waiting for us? '' Frome heard the girl's voice, gaily incredulous: <div class="bookquote">``What on earth's your father's cutter doin' down there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>I kinder knew I'd want to take a ride to-night,'' Eady, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) triumph, tried to put a sentimental note into his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) bragging voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, waiting for me to take a ride. I got the roan colt too. The girl seemed to waver, and Frome saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) twirl the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) scarf irresolutely about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fingers.
<p/>Not for the world would he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) have made a sign to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), though it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) life hung on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) next gesture.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Hold on a minute while I unhitch the colt,'' Denis called to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), springing toward the shed. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood perfectly still, looking after him (<font color='blue'><b>Denis</b></font>), in an attitude of tranquil expectancy torturing to the hidden watcher.
<p/>Frome noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) no longer turned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head from side to side, as though peering through the night for another figure.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) let Denis Eady lead out the horse, climb into the cutter and fling back the bearskin to make room for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) side; then, with a swift motion of flight, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned about and darted up the slope toward the front of the church.
<p/>'' Good-bye! Hope you'll have a lovely ride! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) called back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulder. Denis laughed, and gave the horse a cut that brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Denis</b></font>) quickly abreast of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) retreating figure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along! Get in quick! It's as slippery as thunder on this turn,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Denis</b></font>) cried, leaning over to reach out a hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>By this time they had passed beyond Frome's earshot and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) could only follow the shadowy pantomime of their silhouettes as they continued to move along the crest of the slope above him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) saw Eady, after a moment, jump from the cutter and go toward the girl with the reins over one arm.
<p/>The other he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) tried to slip through hers; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eluded him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) nimbly, and Frome's heart, which had swung out over a black void, trembled back to safety.
<p/>A moment later he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) heard the jingle of departing sleigh bells and discerned a figure advancing alone toward the empty expanse of snow before the church.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) laughed back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Good-night! I'm not getting in. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>In the black shade of the Varnum spruces he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) caught up with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned with a quick
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Think I'd forgotten you, Matt? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) asked with sheepish glee. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered seriously: <div class="bookquote">``I thought maybe you couldn't come back for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't? What on earth could stop me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I knew Zeena wasn't feeling any too good to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s in bed long ago.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) paused, a question struggling in him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>). '' Then you meant to walk home all alone?'' '' Oh, I ain't afraid!
<p/>They stood together in the gloom of the spruces, an empty world glimmering about them wide and grey under the stars.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) laughed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) question out. '' If you thought I hadn't come, why didn't you ride back with Denis Eady?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, where were you? How did you know? I never saw you!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wonder and his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) laughter ran together like spring rills in a thaw.
<p/>Ethan had the sense of having done something arch and ingenious. To prolong the effect he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) groped for a dazzling phrase, and brought out, in a growl of rapture: <div class="bookquote">``Come along.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) slipped an arm through hers, as Eady had done, and fancied it was faintly pressed against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side, but neither of them moved.
<p/>It was so dark under the spruces that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) could barely see the shape of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) longed to stoop his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) cheek and rub it against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) scarf.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) would have liked to stand there with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) all night in the blackness. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) moved forward a step or two and then paused again above the dip of the Corbury road.
<p/>Its icy slope, scored by innumerable runners, looked like a mirror scratched by travellers at an inn. '' There was a whole lot of them coasting before the moon set,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Would you like to come in and coast with them some night? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) asked. '' Oh, would you, Ethan?
<p/>It would be lovely!'' <div class="bookquote">``We'll come to-morrow if there's a moon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lingered, pressing closer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) side. '' Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum came just as near running into the big elm at the bottom.
<p/>We were all sure they were killed. '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) shiver ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) arm. '' Wouldn't it have been too awful?
<p/>They're so happy!'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Ned ain't much at steering. I guess I can take you down all right! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said disdainfully.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``talking big,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>like Denis Eady; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) reaction of joy had unsteadied him (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>), and the inflection with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) had said of the engaged couple <div class="bookquote">``They're so happy!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the couple</b></font>)</div>made the words sound as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) had been thinking of herself and him (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>). '' The elm is dangerous, though.
<p/>It ought to be cut down,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) insisted. '' Would you be afraid of it, with me?'' <div class="bookquote">``I told you I ain't the kind to be afraid
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) tossed back, almost indifferently; and suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) began to walk on with a rapid step. These alterations of mood were the despair and joy of Ethan Frome.
<p/>The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) had no right to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) feelings, and thus provoke the expression of hers, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) attach a fantastic importance to every change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) look and tone.
<p/>The motions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) mind were as incalculable as the flit of a bird in the branches. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>), and feared; now he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) did not, and despaired.
<p/>To-night the pressure of accumulated misgivings sent the scale drooping toward despair, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) indifference was the more chilling after the flush of joy into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) had plunged him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) by dismissing Denis Eady.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) mounted School House Hill at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) side and walked on in silence till they reached the lane leading to the saw-mill; then the need of some definite assurance grew too strong for him (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>).
<p/>You'd have found me right off if you hadn't gone back to have that last reel with Denis,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Denis</b></font>) brought out awkwardly.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Denis</b></font>) could not pronounce the name without a stiffening of the muscles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Denis</b></font>) throat. '' Why, Ethan, how could I tell you were there?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose what folks say is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) jerked out at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>), instead of answering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) stopped short, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) felt, in the darkness, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) face was lifted quickly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>'' Why, what do folks say?'' '' It's natural enough you should be leaving us '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) floundered on, following his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) thought.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) mocked back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>); then, with a sudden drop of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) sweet treble: <div class="bookquote">``You mean that Zeena--ain't suited with me any more?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Is that what they say? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) faltered. Their arms had slipped apart and they stood motionless, each seeking to distinguish the other's face.
<p/>I know I ain't anything like as smart as I ought to be,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) went on, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) vainly struggled for expression.
<p/>There's lots of things a hired girl could do that come awkward to me still--and I haven't got much strength in my arms.
<p/>'' '' But if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d only tell me I'd try. You know she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hardly ever says anything, and sometimes I can see she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ain't suited, and yet I don't know why.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) with a sudden flash of indignation. '' You'd ought to tell me, Ethan Frome-- you'd ought to!
<p/>Unless you want me to go too-- '' Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to go too! The cry was balm to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) raw wound.
<p/>The iron heavens seemed to melt and rain down sweetness. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) struggled for the all-expressive word, and again, his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) arm in hers, found only a deep <div class="bookquote">``Come along.
<p/>They walked on in silence through the blackness of the hemlock-shaded lane, where Ethan's sawmill gloomed through the night, and out again into the comparative clearness of the fields.
<p/>On the farther side of the hemlock belt the open country rolled away before them grey and lonely under the stars.
<p/>Sometimes their way led them under the shade of an overhanging bank or through the thin obscurity of a clump of leafless trees.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here and there a farmhouse stood far back among the fields, mute and cold as a grave-stone. The night was so still that they heard the frozen snow crackle under their feet.
<p/>The crash of a loaded branch falling far off in the woods reverberated like a musket-shot, and once a fox barked, and Mattie shrank closer to Ethan, and quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) steps.
<p/>At length they sighted the group of larches at Ethan's gate, and as they drew near it the sense that the walk was over brought back his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) words.
<p/>'' Then you don't want to leave us, Matt? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) had to stoop his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) head to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) stifled whisper: <div class="bookquote">``Where'd I go, if I did?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) forgot what else he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) had meant to say and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) against him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) so closely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) seemed to feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) warmth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) veins.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>The answer sent a pang through him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) but the tone suffused him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) with joy. '' You ain't crying are you, Matt?
<p/>They turned in at the gate and passed under the shaded knoll where, enclosed in a low fence, the Frome grave-stones slanted at crazy angles through the snow.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``No, of course I'm not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) quavered. Ethan looked at them curiously. For years that quiet company had mocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) restlessness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) desire for change and freedom.
<p/>'' seemed to be written on every headstone; and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) went in or out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) gate he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) thought with a shiver: <div class="bookquote">``I shall just go on living here till I join them.
<p/>But now all desire for change had vanished, and the sight of the little enclosure gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) a warm sense of continuance and stability.
<p/>I guess we'll never let you go, Matt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) whispered, as though even the dead, lovers once, must conspire with him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>); and brushing by the graves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) thought: <div class="bookquote">``We'll always go on living here together, and some day she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)'ll lie there beside me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We never got away--how should you? '' '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) let the vision possess him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) as they climbed the hill to the house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) was never so happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) as when he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) abandoned himself to these dreams. Half-way up the slope Mattie stumbled against some unseen obstruction and clutched his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) sleeve to steady herself.
<p/>The wave of warmth that went through him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) was like the prolongation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) vision. For the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) stole his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) arm about her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) did not resist.
<p/>Zeena always went to bed as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had had her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) supper, and the shutterless windows of the house were dark.
<p/>A dead cucumber-vine dangled from the porch like the crape streamer tied to the door for a death, and the thought flashed through Ethan's brain
<p/>: <div class="bookquote">``If it was there for Zeena--''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had a distinct sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife lying in their bedroom asleep, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mouth slightly open, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) false teeth in a tumbler by the bed...
<p/>They walked on as if they were floating on a summer stream. They walked around to the back of the house, between the rigid gooseberry bushes.
<p/>It was Zeena's habit, when they came back late from the village, to leave the key of the kitchen door under the mat.
<p/>Ethan stood before the door, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) head heavy with dreams, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) arm still about Mattie. '' Matt--'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) began, not knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) meant to say.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) slipped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) hold without speaking, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) stooped down and felt for the key. '' It's not there!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) said, straightening himself with a start.
<p/>Maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s forgotten it,'' Mattie said in a tremulous whisper; but both of them knew that it was not like Zeena to forget.
<p/>They strained their eyes at each other through the icy darkness. Such a thing had never happened before. '' '' It might have fallen off into the snow,'' Mattie continued, after a pause during which they had stood intently listening.
<p/>'' It must have been pushed off, then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) rejoined in the same tone. Another wild thought tore through him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>). What if tramps had been there--what if...
<p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) listened, fancying he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) heard a distant sound in the house; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) pocket for a match, and kneeling down, passed its light slowly over the rough edges of snow about the doorstep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) was still kneeling when his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) eyes, on a level with the lower panel of the door, caught a faint ray beneath it.
<p/>Who could be stirring in that silent house? He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) heard a step on the stairs, and again for an instant the thought of tramps tore through him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/>Against the dark background of the kitchen she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) stood up tall and angular, one hand drawing a quilted counterpane to her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) flat breast, while the other held a lamp.
<p/>The light, on a level with her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) chin, drew out of the darkness her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) puckered throat and the projecting wrist of the hand that clutched the quilt, and deepened fantastically the hollows and prominences of her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) high-boned face under its ring of crimping-pins.
<p/>To Ethan, still in the rosy haze of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hour with Mattie, the sight came with the intense precision of the last dream before waking.
<p/>Then the door opened and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had never before known what his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife looked like.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) drew aside without speaking, and Mattie and Ethan passed into the kitchen, which had the deadly chill of a vault after the dry cold of the night.
<p/>'' Guess you forgot about us, Zeena,'' Ethan joked, stamping the snow from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) boots. '' No. I just felt so mean I couldn't sleep.
<p/>'' Mattie came forward, unwinding her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wraps, the colour of the cherry scarf in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fresh lips and cheeks. '' I'm so sorry, Zeena!
<p/>Isn't there anything I can do?'' '' No; there's nothing. '' Zeena turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). '' You might `a' shook off that snow outside,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) walked out of the kitchen ahead of them and pausing in the hall raised the lamp at arm's-length, as if to light them up the stairs.
<p/>The doors of the two bedrooms faced each other across the narrow upper landing, and to-night it was peculiarly repugnant to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that Mattie should see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) follow Zeena.
<p/>Ethan paused also, affecting to fumble for the peg on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) coat and cap. '' I guess I won't come up yet awhile,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said, turning as if to go back to the kitchen.
<p/>Zeena stopped short and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>). '' For the land's sake--what you going to do down here?'' <div class="bookquote">``I've got the mill accounts to go over.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) continued to stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>), the flame of the unshaded lamp bringing out with microscopic cruelty the fretful lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) face.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' At this time o' night? You'll ketch your death. The fire's out long ago. '' Without answering he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) moved away toward the kitchen.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) did so his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) glance crossed Mattie's and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) fancied that a fugitive warning gleamed through her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lashes. The next moment they sank to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) flushed cheeks and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) began to mount the stairs ahead of Zeena.
<p/>It is powerful cold down here,'' Ethan assented; and with lowered head he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) went up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife's wake, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) across the threshold of their room.
<p/>There was some hauling to be done at the lower end of the wood-lot, and Ethan was out early the next day.
<p/>The sunrise burned red in a pure sky, the shadows on the rim of the wood-lot were darkly blue, and beyond the white and scintillating fields patches of far-off forest hung like smoke.
<p/>when his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) muscles were swinging to their familiar task and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) lungs expanding with long draughts of mountain air, that Ethan did his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) clearest thinking.
<p/>'' That's so. III The winter morning was as clear as crystal. It was in the early morning stillness, He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) and Zeena had not exchanged a word after the door of their room had closed on them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had measured out some drops from a medicine-bottle on a chair by the bed and, after swallowing them, and wrapping her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) head in a piece of yellow flannel, had lain down with her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) face turned away.
<p/>Ethan undressed hurriedly and blew out the light so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) should not see her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) place at her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) side.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) lay there he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) could hear Mattie moving about in her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) room, and her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) candle, sending its small ray across the landing, drew a scarcely perceptible line of light under his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) eyes fixed on the light till it vanished. Then the room grew perfectly black, and not a sound was audible but Zeena's asthmatic breathing.
<p/>Ethan felt confusedly that there were many things he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) ought to think about, but through his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) tingling veins and tired brain only one sensation throbbed: the warmth of Mattie's shoulder against his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/>Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) not kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) there? A few hours earlier he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) would not have asked himself the question.
<p/>Even a few minutes earlier, when they had stood alone outside the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) would not have dared to think of kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>).
<p/>But since he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) lips in the lamplight he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) felt that they were his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>). Now, in the bright morning air, her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) face was still before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/>It was part of the sun's red and of the pure glitter on the snow. How the girl had changed since she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had come to Starkfield!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) remembered what a colourless slip of a thing she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had looked the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had met her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at the station.
<p/>And all the first winter, how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had shivered with cold when the northerly gales shook the thin clapboards and the snow beat like hail against the loose-hung windows!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had been afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would hate the hard life, the cold and loneliness; but not a sign of discontent escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Zeena took the view that Mattie was bound to make the best of Starkfield since she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hadn't any other place to go to; but this did not strike Ethan as conclusive.
<p/>Zeena, at any rate, did not apply the principle in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) felt all the more sorry for the girl because misfortune had, in a sense, indentured her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to them.
<p/>Mattie Silver was the daughter of a cousin of Zenobia Frome's, who had inflamed his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) clan with mingled sentiments of envy and admiration by descending from the hills to Connecticut, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) had married a Stamford girl and succeeded to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father's thriving <div class="bookquote">``drug''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>business.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) accounts revealed merely what the means had been; and these were such that it was fortunate for his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) wife and daughter that his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) books were examined only after his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) impressive funeral.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) wife died of the disclosure, and Mattie, at twenty, was left alone to make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) way on the fifty dollars obtained from the sale of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) piano.
<p/>Unhappily Orin Silver, a man of far-reaching aims, had died too soon to prove that the end justifies the means. For this purpose her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) equipment, though varied, was inadequate.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could trim a hat, make molasses candy, recite <div class="bookquote">``Curfew shall not ring to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and play <div class="bookquote">``The Lost Chord''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and a pot-pourri from <div class="bookquote">``Carmen.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) tried to extend the field of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) activities in the direction of stenography and book-keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) health broke down, and six months on her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) feet behind the counter of a department store did not tend to restore it.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) nearest relations had been induced to place their savings in her (<font color='blue'><b>Carmen</b></font>) father's hands, and though, after his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) death, they ungrudgingly acquitted themselves of the Christian duty of returning good for evil by giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) daughter all the advice at their disposal, they could hardly be expected to supplement it by material aid.
<p/>But when Zenobia's doctor recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) looking about for some one to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) with the house-work the clan instantly saw the chance of exacting a compensation from Mattie.
<p/>Zenobia, though doubtful of the girl's efficiency, was tempted by the freedom to find fault without much risk of losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>); and so Mattie came to Starkfield.
<p/>During the first months Ethan alternately burned with the desire to see Mattie defy her (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) and trembled with fear of the result.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Zenobia's fault-finding was of the silent kind, but not the less penetrating for that. Then the situation grew less strained.
<p/>The pure air, and the long summer hours in the open, gave back life and elasticity to Mattie, and Zeena, with more leisure to devote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) complex ailments, grew less watchful of the girl's omissions; so that Ethan, struggling on under the burden of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) barren farm and failing saw-mill, could at least imagine that peace reigned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) house.
<p/>There was really, even now, no tangible evidence to the contrary; but since the previous night a vague dread had hung on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) sky-line.
<p/>It was formed of Zeena's obstinate silence, of Mattie's sudden look of warning, of the memory of just such fleeting imperceptible signs as those which told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>), on certain stainless mornings, that before night there would be rain.
<p/>The hauling was not over till mid-day, and as the lumber was to be delivered to Andrew Hale, the Starkfield builder, it was really easier for Ethan to send Jotham Powell, the hired man, back to the farm on foot, and drive the load down to the village himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had scrambled up on the logs, and was sitting astride of them, close over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) shaggy grays, when, coming between him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) and their streaming necks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had a vision of the warning look that Mattie had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) the night before.
<p/>If there's going to be any trouble I want to be there,'' was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) vague reflection, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) threw to Jotham the unexpected order to unhitch the team and lead them back to the barn.
<p/>It was a slow trudge home through the heavy fields, and when the two men entered the kitchen Mattie was lifting the coffee from the stove and Zeena was already at the table.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) dread was so strong that, man-like, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) sought to postpone certainty. '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) husband stopped short at sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>Instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) usual calico wrapper and knitted shawl she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wore her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) best dress of brown merino, and above her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thin strands of hair, which still preserved the tight undulations of the crimping-pins, rose a hard perpendicular bonnet, as to which Ethan's clearest notion was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had to pay five dollars for it at the Bettsbridge Emporium.
<p/>On the floor beside her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stood his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) old valise and a bandbox wrapped in newspapers. '' Why, where are you going, Zeena?
<p/>I've got my shooting pains so bad that I'm going over to Bettsbridge to spend the night with Aunt Martha Pierce and see that new doctor,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) answered in a matter-of-fact tone, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had said she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was going into the store-room to take a look at the preserves, or up to the attic to go over the blankets.
<p/>Twice or thrice before she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had suddenly packed Ethan's valise and started off to Bettsbridge, or even Springfield, to seek the advice of some new doctor, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) husband had grown to dread these expeditions because of their cost.
<p/>Zeena always came back laden with expensive remedies, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) last visit to Springfield had been commemorated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) paying twenty dollars for an electric battery of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had never been able to learn the use.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) exclaimed. '' In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) sedentary habits such abrupt decisions were not without precedent in Zeena's history. But for the moment his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sense of relief was so great as to preclude all other feelings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had now no doubt that Zeena had spoken the truth in saying, the night before, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had sat up because she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) felt <div class="bookquote">``too mean''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to sleep: her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) abrupt resolve to seek medical advice showed that, as usual, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was wholly absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) health.
<p/>As if expecting a protest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) continued plaintively; <div class="bookquote">``If you're too busy with the hauling I presume you can let Jotham Powell drive me over with the sorrel in time to ketch the train at the Flats.
<p/>During the winter months there was no stage between Starkfield and Bettsbridge, and the trains which stopped at Corbury Flats were slow and infrequent.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) husband hardly heard what she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was saying. A rapid calculation showed Ethan that Zeena could not be back at the farm before the following evening...
<p/>'' If I'd supposed you'd `a' made any objection to Jotham Powell's driving me over-- '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) began again, as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) silence had implied refusal.
<p/>On the brink of departure she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was always seized with a flux of words. '' All I know is,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I can't go on the way I am much longer.
<p/>The pains are clear away down to my ankles now, or I'd `a' walked in to Starkfield on my own feet, sooner'n put you out, and asked Michael Eady to let me ride over on his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) wagon to the Flats, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) sends to meet the train that brings his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) groceries.
<p/>I'd `a' had two hours to wait in the station, but I'd sooner `a' done it, even with this cold, than to have you say--''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) became suddenly conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) was looking at Mattie while Zeena talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>), and with an effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) wife.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat opposite the window, and the pale light reflected from the banks of snow made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face look more than usually drawn and bloodless, sharpened the three parallel creases between ear and cheek, and drew querulous lines from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thin nose to the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mouth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course Jotham'll drive you over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>Ethan roused himself to answer. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was but seven years her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's senior, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was only twenty-eight, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was already an old woman.
<p/>the fact that, for the first time since Mattie had come to live with them, Zeena was to be away for a night.
<p/>Ethan tried to say something befitting the occasion, but there was only one thought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) mind: He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wondered if the girl were thinking of it too....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) knew that Zeena must be wondering why he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) did not offer to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to the Flats and let Jotham Powell take the lumber to Starkfield, and at first he (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) could not think of a pretext for not doing so; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I'd take you over myself, only I've got to collect the cash for the lumber.
<p/>As soon as the words were spoken he (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) regretted them, not only because they were untrue--there being no prospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) receiving cash payment from Hale--but also because he (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) knew from experience the imprudence of letting Zeena think he (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) was in funds on the eve of one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) therapeutic excursions.
<p/>At the moment, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) one desire was to avoid the long drive with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) behind the ancient sorrel who never went out of a walk.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Zeena made no reply: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) did not seem to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) had said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) had already pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) plate aside, and was measuring out a draught from a large bottle at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) elbow.
<p/>It ain't done me a speck of good, but I guess I might as well use it up,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) remarked; adding, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) pushed the empty bottle toward Mattie: <div class="bookquote">``If you can get the taste out it'll do for pickles.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mattie/Mattie Silver</b></font>)</div>'' IV As soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wife had driven off Ethan took his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) coat and cap from the peg. Mattie was washing up the dishes, humming one of the dance tunes of the night before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``So long, Matt,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered gaily <div class="bookquote">``So long, Ethan'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and that was all. It was warm and bright in the kitchen.
<p/>The sun slanted through the south window on the girl's moving figure, on the cat dozing in a chair, and on the geraniums brought in from the door-way, where Ethan had planted them in the summer to <div class="bookquote">``make a garden''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>for Mattie.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) would have liked to linger on, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tidy up and then settle down to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sewing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wanted still more to get the hauling done and be back at the farm before night.
<p/>The kitchen was a poor place, not <div class="bookquote">``spruce''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>and shining as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) mother had kept it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) boyhood; but it was surprising what a homelike look the mere fact of Zeena's absence gave it.
<p/>All the way down to the village he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) continued to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) return to Mattie. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) pictured what it would be like that evening, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) and Mattie were there after supper.
<p/>For the first time they would be alone together indoors, and they would sit there, one on each side of the stove, like a married couple, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) stocking feet and smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) pipe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) laughing and talking in that funny way she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had, which was always as new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had never heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) before.
<p/>The sweetness of the picture, and the relief of knowing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) fears of <div class="bookquote">``trouble''  (<font color='red'><b>Zeena</b></font>)</div>with Zeena were unfounded, sent up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) spirits with a rush, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>), who was usually so silent, whistled and sang aloud as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) drove through the snowy fields.
<p/>By nature grave and inarticulate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) admired recklessness and gaiety in others and was warmed to the marrow by friendly human intercourse.
<p/>At Worcester, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had the name of keeping to himself and not being much of a hand at a good time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had secretly gloried in being clapped on the back and hailed as <div class="bookquote">``Old Ethe''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Old Stiff'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and the cessation of such familiarities had increased the chill of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) return to Starkfield.
<p/>There was in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) a slumbering spark of sociability which the long Starkfield winters had not yet extinguished. There the silence had deepened about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) year by year.
<p/>Left alone, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) father's accident, to carry the burden of farm and mill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had had no time for convivial loiterings in the village; and when his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) mother fell ill the loneliness of the house grew more oppressive than that of the fields.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) mother had been a talker in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) day, but after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``trouble''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice was seldom heard, though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had not lost the power of speech.
<p/>Sometimes, in the long winter evenings, when in desperation her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't <div class="bookquote">``say something,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would lift a finger and answer: <div class="bookquote">``Because I'm listening'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and on stormy nights, when the loud wind was about the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would complain, if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>): ``They're talking so out there that I can't hear you.
<p/>It was only when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) drew toward her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) last illness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cousin Zenobia Pierce came over from the next valley to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), that human speech was heard again in the house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) might have <div class="bookquote">``gone like his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) mother''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>if the sound of a new voice had not come to steady him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>).
<p/>'' After the mortal silence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) long imprisonment Zeena's volubility was music in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) ears. Zeena seemed to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) case at a glance.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) for not knowing the simplest sick-bed duties and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``go right along out''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to see to things.
<p/>The mere fact of obeying her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) orders, of feeling free to go about his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) business again and talk with other men, restored his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) shaken balance and magnified his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) sense of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) owed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) efficiency shamed and dazzled him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed to possess by instinct all the household wisdom that his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) long apprenticeship had not instilled in him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>).
<p/>When the end came it was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) who had to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) to hitch up and go for the undertaker, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought it <div class="bookquote">``funny
<p/>After the funeral, when he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) preparing to go away, he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) was seized with an unreasoning dread of being left alone on the farm; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) was doing he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to stay there with him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) had often thought since that it would not have happened if his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) mother had died in spring instead of winter...
<p/>When they married it was agreed that, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) could straighten out the difficulties resulting from Mrs. Frome's long illness, they would sell the farm and saw-mill and try their luck in a large town.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) had not settled beforehand who was to have his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) mother's clothes and the sewing-machine. Ethan's love of nature did not take the form of a taste for agriculture.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) had always wanted to be an engineer, and to live in towns, where there were lectures and big libraries and ``fellows doing things.
<p/>A slight engineering job in Florida, put in his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) way during his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) period of study at Worcester, increased his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) faith in his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) ability as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) eagerness to see the world; and he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) felt sure that, with a <div class="bookquote">``smart''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>wife like Zeena, it would not be long before he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) had made himself a place in it.
<p/>Zeena's native village was slightly larger and nearer to the railway than Starkfield, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband see from the first that life on an isolated farm was not what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had expected when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) married.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chose to look down on Starkfield, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not have lived in a place which looked down on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>Even Bettsbridge or Shadd's Falls would not have been sufficiently aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and in the greater cities which attracted Ethan she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have suffered a complete loss of identity.
<p/>And within a year of their marriage she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) developed the <div class="bookquote">``sickliness''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which had since made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) notable even in a community rich in pathological instances.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came to take care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) mother she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had seemed to Ethan like the very genius of health, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) soon saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) skill as a nurse had been acquired by the absorbed observation of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own symptoms.
<p/>'' But purchasers were slow in coming, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) waited for them Ethan learned the impossibility of transplanting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) too fell silent.
<p/>Perhaps it was the inevitable effect of life on the farm, or perhaps, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sometimes said, it was because Ethan <div class="bookquote">``never listened.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spoke it was only to complain, and to complain of things not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) power to remedy; and to check a tendency to impatient retort he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had first formed the habit of not answering her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and finally of thinking of other things while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) talked.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>The charge was not wholly unfounded. Of late, however, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had reasons for observing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) more closely, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) silence had begun to trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>Zeena, who had at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fingers' ends the pathological chart of the whole region, had cited many cases of the kind while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) mother; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) himself knew of certain lonely farm-houses in the neighbourhood where stricken creatures pined, and of others where sudden tragedy had come of their presence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) mother's growing taciturnity, and wondered if Zeena were also turning <div class="bookquote">``queer. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Zeena</b></font>)</div>Women did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) knew. At times, looking at Zeena's shut face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) felt the chill of such forebodings.
<p/>At other times her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) silence seemed deliberately assumed to conceal far-reaching intentions, mysterious conclusions drawn from suspicions and resentments impossible to guess.
<p/>That supposition was even more disturbing than the other; and it was the one which had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) the night before, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) standing in the kitchen door.
<p/>Now her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) departure for Bettsbridge had once more eased his (<font color='blue'><b>Bettsbridge</b></font>) mind, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bettsbridge</b></font>) thoughts were on the prospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bettsbridge</b></font>) evening with Mattie.
<p/>Only one thing weighed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bettsbridge</b></font>), and that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bettsbridge</b></font>) having told Zeena that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bettsbridge</b></font>) was to receive cash for the lumber.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bettsbridge</b></font>) foresaw so clearly the consequences of this imprudence that with considerable reluctance he (<font color='blue'><b>Bettsbridge</b></font>) decided to ask Andrew Hale for a small advance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bettsbridge</b></font>) load.
<p/>When Ethan drove into Hale's yard the builder was just getting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) sleigh. '' Hello, Ethe! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said.
<p/>Andrew Hale was a ruddy man with a big gray moustache and a stubbly double-chin unconstrained by a collar; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) scrupulously clean shirt was always fastened by a small diamond stud.
<p/>This display of opulence was misleading, for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) did a fairly good business it was known that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) easygoing habits and the demands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) large family frequently kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) what Starkfield called ``behind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) was an old friend of Ethan's family, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) house one of the few to which Zeena occasionally went, drawn there by the fact that Mrs. Hale, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) youth, had done more <div class="bookquote">``doctoring''  (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div>than any other woman in Starkfield, and was still a recognised authority on symptoms and treatment.
<p/>'' This comes handy. '' '' Hale went up to the grays and patted their sweating flanks. '' Well, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you keep them two as if they was pets.
<p/>Ethan set about unloading the logs and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) job he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) pushed open the glazed door of the shed which the builder used as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) office.
<p/>Hale sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) feet up on the stove, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) back propped against a battered desk strewn with papers: the place, like the man, was warm, genial and untidy. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The latter did not know how to begin, but at length he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) managed to bring out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) request for an advance of fifty dollars.
<p/>'' Sit right down and thaw out,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) greeted Ethan. The blood rushed to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thin skin under the sting of Hale's astonishment.
<p/>It was the builder's custom to pay at the end of three months, and there was no precedent between the two men for a cash settlement.
<p/>Ethan felt that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had pleaded an urgent need Hale might have made shift to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>); but pride, and an instinctive prudence, kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) from resorting to this argument.
<p/>After his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) father's death it had taken time to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) head above water, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) did not want Andrew Hale, or any one else in Starkfield, to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) was going under again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) therefore made his (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) demand with the awkwardness of a proud man who will not admit to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) is stooping; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) was not much surprised at Hale's refusal.
<p/>The builder refused genially, as he (<font color='blue'><b>builder</b></font>) did everything else: he (<font color='blue'><b>builder</b></font>) treated the matter as something in the nature of a practical joke, and wanted to know if Ethan meditated buying a grand piano or adding a <div class="bookquote">``cupolo''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) house; offering, in the latter case, to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) services free of cost.
<p/>Ethan's arts were soon exhausted, and after an embarrassed pause he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wished Hale good day and opened the door of the office.
<p/>Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hated lying; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wanted the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wanted it, and it was nobody's business to ask why. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) passed out the builder suddenly called after him (<font color='blue'><b>builder</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``See here--you ain't in a tight place, are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>Ethan's pride retorted before his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) reason had time to intervene. '' Well, that's good! Because I am, a shade.
<p/>Business is pretty slack, to begin with, and then I'm fixing up a little house for Ned and Ruth when they're married.
<p/>Fact is, I was going to ask you to give me a little extra time on that payment. I'm glad to do it for 'em, but it costs.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) look appealed to Ethan for sympathy. '' The young people like things nice. You know how it is yourself: it's not so long ago since you fixed up your own place for Zeena.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) walked away the builder's last phrase lingered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) ears, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) reflected grimly that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) seven years with Zeena seemed to Starkfield <div class="bookquote">``not so long.
<p/>The afternoon was drawing to an end, and here and there a lighted pane spangled the cold gray dusk and made the snow look whiter.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Starkfield</b></font>)</div>Ethan left the grays in Hale's stable and went about some other business in the village. '' The bitter weather had driven every one indoors and Ethan had the long rural street to himself.
<p/>Ethan recognised Michael Eady's roan colt, and young Denis Eady, in a handsome new fur cap, leaned forward and waved a greeting.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) heard the brisk play of sleigh-bells and a cutter passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>), drawn by a free-going horse. '' Hello, Ethe!''
<p/>The cutter was going in the direction of the Frome farm, and Ethan's heart contracted as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) listened to the dwindling bells.
<p/>What more likely than that Denis Eady had heard of Zeena's departure for Bettsbridge, and was profiting by the opportunity to spend an hour with Mattie?
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) shouted and spun on. Ethan was ashamed of the storm of jealousy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) breast. It seemed unworthy of the girl that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should be so violent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) walked on to the church corner and entered the shade of the Varnum spruces, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the night before.
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) approach it melted for an instant into two separate shapes and then conjoined again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) heard a kiss, and a half-laughing
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) passed into their gloom he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) saw an indistinct outline just ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>provoked by the discovery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) presence.
<p/>Again the outline hastily disunited and the Varnum gate slammed on one half while the other hurried on ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>Ethan smiled at the discomfiture he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had caused. What did it matter to Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum if they were caught kissing each other?
<p/>It pleased Ethan to have surprised a pair of lovers on the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) and Mattie had stood with such a thirst for each other in their hearts; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) felt a pang at the thought that these two need not hide their happiness.
<p/>Everybody in Starkfield knew they were engaged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) fetched the grays from Hale's stable and started on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) long climb back to the farm.
<p/>The cold was less sharp than earlier in the day and a thick fleecy sky threatened snow for the morrow. Here and there a star pricked through, showing behind it a deep well of blue.
<p/>In an hour or two the moon would push over the ridge behind the farm, burn a gold-edged rent in the clouds, and then be swallowed by them.
<p/>A mournful peace hung on the fields, as though they felt the relaxing grasp of the cold and stretched themselves in their long winter sleep.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) drew near the farm he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw, through the thin screen of larches at the gate, a light twinkling in the house above him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>Ethan's ears were alert for the jingle of sleigh-bells, but not a sound broke the silence of the lonely road. ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s up in her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) room,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``fixing herself up for supper'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) remembered Zeena's sarcastic stare when Mattie, on the evening of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) arrival, had come down to supper with smoothed hair and a ribbon at her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) neck.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) passed by the graves on the knoll and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) head to glance at one of the older headstones, which had interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) deeply as a boy because it bore his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) name.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) used to think that fifty years sounded like a long time to live together; but now it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) that they might pass in a flash.
<p/>Then, with a sudden dart of irony, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wondered if, when their turn came, the same epitaph would be written over him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) and Zeena.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) opened the barn-door and craned his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) head into the obscurity, half-fearing to discover Denis Eady's roan colt in the stall beside the sorrel.
<p/>But the old horse was there alone, mumbling his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) crib with toothless jaws, and Ethan whistled cheerfully while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) bedded down the grays and shook an extra measure of oats into their mangers.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was not a tuneful throat--but harsh melodies burst from it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) locked the barn and sprang up the hill to the house.
<p/>SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ETHAN FROME AND ENDURANCE HIS (<font color='blue'><b>FROME</b></font>) WIFE, WHO DWELLED TOGETHER IN PEACE FOR FIFTY YEARS. He (<font color='blue'><b>FROME</b></font>) reached the kitchen-porch and turned the door-handle; but the door did not yield to his (<font color='blue'><b>FROME</b></font>) touch.
<p/>Startled at finding it locked he (<font color='blue'><b>FROME</b></font>) rattled the handle violently; then he (<font color='blue'><b>FROME</b></font>) reflected that Mattie was alone and that it was natural she (<font color='blue'><b>WIFE</b></font>) should barricade herself at nightfall.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) stood in the darkness expecting to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>WIFE</b></font>) step. It did not come, and after vainly straining his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) ears he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) called out in a voice that shook with joy:
<p/>Silence answered; but in a minute or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) caught a sound on the stairs and saw a line of light about the door-frame, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had seen it the night before.
<p/>So strange was the precision with which the incidents of the previous evening were repeating themselves that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) half expected, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) heard the key turn, to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wife before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) on the threshold; but the door opened, and Mattie faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, Matt!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stood just as Zeena had stood, a lifted lamp in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand, against the black background of the kitchen.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) held the light at the same level, and it drew out with the same distinctness her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) slim young throat and the brown wrist no bigger than a child's.
<p/>Then, striking upward, it threw a lustrous fleck on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lips, edged her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes with velvet shade, and laid a milky whiteness above the black curve of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brows.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wore her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) usual dress of darkish stuff, and there was no bow at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) neck; but through her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hair she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had run a streak of crimson ribbon.
<p/>This tribute to the unusual transformed and glorified her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seemed to Ethan taller, fuller, more womanly in shape and motion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stood aside, smiling silently, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) entered, and then moved away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) with something soft and flowing in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gait.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) set the lamp on the table, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) saw that it was carefully laid for supper, with fresh dough-nuts, stewed blueberries and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) favourite pickles in a dish of gay red glass.
<p/>A bright fire glowed in the stove and the cat lay stretched before it, watching the table with a drowsy eye.
<p/>Ethan was suffocated with the sense of well-being. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) went out into the passage to hang up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) coat and pull off his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wet boots.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) came back Mattie had set the teapot on the table and the cat was rubbing itself persuasively against her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) ankles.
<p/>'' Why, Puss! I nearly tripped over you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) cried, the laughter sparkling through her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) lashes. Again Ethan felt a sudden twinge of jealousy.
<p/>Could it be his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) coming that gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) such a kindled face? '' Well, Matt, any visitors? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) threw off, stooping down carelessly to examine the fastening of the stove.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) nodded and laughed <div class="bookquote">``Yes, one,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) felt a blackness settling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) brows. '' Who was that? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) questioned, raising himself up to slant a glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) scowl.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) eyes danced with malice. '' Why, Jotham Powell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) came in after he (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) got back, and asked for a drop of coffee before he (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) went down home.
<p/>'' The blackness lifted and light flooded Ethan's brain. '' That all? Well, I hope you made out to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) have it.
<p/>And after a pause he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) felt it right to add: <div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) got Zeena over to the Flats all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The name threw a chill between them, and they stood a moment looking sideways at each other before Mattie said with a shy laugh.
<p/>'' '' Oh, yes ; in plenty of time. '' '' I guess it's about time for supper. '' They drew their seats up to the table, and the cat, unbidden, jumped between them into Zeena's empty chair.
<p/>'' Oh, Puss!'' said Mattie, and they laughed again. Ethan, a moment earlier, had felt himself on the brink of eloquence; but the mention of Zeena had paralysed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>Mattie seemed to feel the contagion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) embarrassment, and sat with downcast lids, sipping her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) tea, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) feigned an insatiable appetite for dough-nuts and sweet pickles.
<p/>At last, after casting about for an effective opening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) took a long gulp of tea, cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) throat, and said: <div class="bookquote">``Looks as if there'd be more snow.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) feigned great interest. '' Is that so? Do you suppose it'll interfere with Zeena's getting back? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) flushed red as the question escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), and hastily set down the cup she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was lifting.
<p/>Ethan reached over for another helping of pickles. '' You never can tell, this time of year, it drifts so bad on the Flats.
<p/>'' The name had benumbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) again, and once more he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) felt as if Zeena were in the room between them.
<p/>The cat, unnoticed, had crept up on muffled paws from Zeena's seat to the table, and was stealthily elongating its body in the direction of the milk-jug, which stood between Ethan and Mattie.
<p/>'' Oh, Puss, you're too greedy!'' Mattie cried. The two leaned forward at the same moment and their hands met on the handle of the jug.
<p/>The cat, profiting by this unusual demonstration, tried to effect an unnoticed retreat, and in doing so backed into the pickle-dish, which fell to the floor with a crash.
<p/>Mattie's hand was underneath, and Ethan kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) clasped on it a moment longer than was necessary. Mattie, in an instant, had sprung from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) chair and was down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) knees by the fragments.
<p/>'' Oh, Ethan, Ethan--it's all to pieces! What will Zeena say? '' But this time his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) courage was up. '' Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>)'ll have to say it to the cat, any way!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) rejoined with a laugh, kneeling down at Mattie's side to scrape up the swimming pickles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) lifted stricken eyes to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/>Yes, but, you see, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) never meant it should be used, not even when there was company; and I had to get up on the step-ladder to reach it down from the top shelf of the china-closet, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) keeps it with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) best things, and of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>)'ll want to know why I did it--'' The case was so serious that it called forth all of Ethan's latent resolution.
<p/>'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) needn't know anything about it if you keep quiet. I'll get another just like it to-morrow. Where did it come from?
<p/>I'll go to Shadd's Falls for it if I have to!'' '' Oh, you'll never get another even there! It was a wedding present--
<p/>don't you remember? It came all the way from Philadelphia, from Zeena's aunt that married the minister. That's why she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) wouldn't ever use it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) began to cry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) felt as if every one of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) tears were pouring over him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) like burning lead.
<p/>Oh, Ethan, Ethan, what in the world shall I do? '' '' Don't, Matt, don't-- oh, don't! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) implored her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) struggled to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) feet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) rose and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) helplessly while she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) spread out the pieces of glass on the kitchen dresser.
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) as if the shattered fragments of their evening lay there. '' Here, give them to me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) said in a voice of sudden authority.
<p/>Without replying he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) gathered the pieces of glass into his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) broad palm and walked out of the kitchen to the passage.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) lit a candle-end, opened the china-closet, and, reaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) long arm up to the highest shelf, laid the pieces together with such accuracy of touch that a close inspection convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) of the impossibility of detecting from below that the dish was broken.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) glued it together the next morning months might elapse before his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) wife noticed what had happened, and meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) might after all be able to match the dish at Shadd's Falls or Bettsbridge.
<p/>Having satisfied himself that there was no risk of immediate discovery he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) went back to the kitchen with a lighter step, and found Mattie disconsolately removing the last scraps of pickle from the floor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) drew aside, instinctively obeying his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) tone. '' Oh, Ethan, what are you going to do? '' '' It's all right, Matt.
<p/>Completely reassured, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shone on him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) through tear-hung lashes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) soul swelled with pride as he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) saw how his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) tone subdued her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>Except when he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) was steering a big log down the mountain to his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) mill he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) had never known such a thrilling sense of mastery.
<p/>They finished supper, and while Mattie cleared the table Ethan went to look at the cows and then took a last turn about the house.
<p/>Come back and finish supper,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) commanded her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not even ask what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had done. V The earth lay dark under a muffled sky and the air was so still that now
<p/>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) heard a lump of snow come thumping down from a tree far off on the edge of the wood-lot.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) returned to the kitchen Mattie had pushed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) chair to the stove and seated herself near the lamp with a bit of sewing.
<p/>The scene was just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had dreamed of it that morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) sat down, drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) pipe from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) pocket and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) feet to the glow.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hard day's work in the keen air made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) feel at once lazy and light of mood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had a confused sense of being in another world, where all was warmth and harmony and time could bring no change.
<p/>The only drawback to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) complete well-being was the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) could not see Mattie from where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) sat; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) was too indolent to move and after a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Come over here and sit by the stove.
<p/>As her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) young brown head detached itself against the patch-work cushion that habitually framed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wife's gaunt countenance, Ethan had a momentary shock.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Zeena's empty rocking-chair stood facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>). Mattie rose obediently, and seated herself in it. It was almost as if the other face, the face of the superseded woman, had obliterated that of the intruder.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) changed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position, leaning forward to bend her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head above her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) work, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) saw only the foreshortened tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nose and the streak of red in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair; then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) slipped to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet, saying <div class="bookquote">``I can't see to sew,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chair by the lamp.
<p/>Ethan made a pretext of getting up to replenish the stove, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) seat he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) pushed it sideways that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) might get a view of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) profile and of the lamplight falling on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands.
<p/>The cat, who had been a puzzled observer of these unusual movements, jumped up into Zeena's chair, rolled itself into a ball, and lay watching them with narrowed eyes.
<p/>The clock ticked above the dresser, a piece of charred wood fell now and then in the stove, and the faint sharp scent of the geraniums mingled with the odour of Ethan's smoke, which began to throw a blue haze about the lamp and to hang its greyish cobwebs in the shadowy corners of the room.
<p/>After a moment Mattie seemed to be affected by the same sense of constraint. Deep quiet sank on the room. All constraint had vanished between the two, and they began to talk easily and simply.
<p/>They spoke of every-day things, of the prospect of snow, of the next church sociable, of the loves and quarrels of Starkfield.
<p/>The commonplace nature of what they said produced in Ethan an illusion of long-established intimacy which no outburst of emotion could have given, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) imagination adrift on the fiction that they had always spent their evenings thus and would always go on doing so...
<p/>This is the night we were to have gone coasting, Matt,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) said at length, with the rich sense, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) spoke, that they could go on any other night they chose, since they had all time before them.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) smiled back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>). '' I guess you forgot!'' '' No, I didn't forget; but it's as dark as Egypt outdoors.
<p/>We might go to-morrow if there's a moon. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) laughed with pleasure, her (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) head tilted back, the lamplight sparkling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) lips and teeth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>), marvelling at the way her (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) face changed with each turn of their talk, like a wheat-field under a summer breeze.
<p/>It was intoxicating to find such magic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) clumsy words, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) longed to try new ways of using it.
<p/>'' That would be lovely, Ethan!'' '' Would you be scared to go down the Corbury road with me on a night like this?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) asked. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) cheeks burned redder. '' I ain't any more scared than you are!'' '' Well, I'd be scared, then; I wouldn't do it.
<p/>That's an ugly corner down by the big elm. If a fellow didn't keep his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eyes open he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'d go plumb into it.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) luxuriated in the sense of protection and authority which his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) words conveyed. To prolong and intensify the feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``I guess we're well enough here.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) tone was so sweet that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) took the pipe from his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mouth and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chair up to the table.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) lids sink slowly, in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) loved. '' Yes, we're well enough here,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) sighed. Leaning forward, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) touched the farther end of the strip of brown stuff that she (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) was hemming.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, Matt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) began with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``what do you think I saw under the Varnum spruces, coming along home just now?
<p/>The words had been on his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) tongue all the evening, but now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) had spoken them they struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) as inexpressibly vulgar and out of place.
<p/>Mattie blushed to the roots of her (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) hair and pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) needle rapidly twice or thrice through her (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) work, insensibly drawing the end of it away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/>I suppose it was Ruth and Ned,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) said in a low voice, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had suddenly touched on something grave.
<p/>Ethan had imagined that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) allusion might open the way to the accepted pleasantries, and these perhaps in turn to a harmless caress, if only a mere touch on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) hand.
<p/>I saw a friend of yours getting kissed. '' '' But now he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) blush had set a flaming guard about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knew that most young men made nothing at all of giving a pretty girl a kiss, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) remembered that the night before, when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had put his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arm about Mattie, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not resisted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) supposed it was his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) natural awkwardness that made him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) feel so. But that had been out-of-doors, under the open irresponsible night.
<p/>Now, in the warm lamplit room, with all its ancient implications of conformity and order, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed infinitely farther away from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) and more unapproachable.
<p/>To ease his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) constraint he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I suppose they'll be setting a date before long.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. I shouldn't wonder if they got married some time along in the summer.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pronounced the word married as if her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice caressed it. It seemed a rustling covert leading to enchanted glades.
<p/>A pang shot through Ethan, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said, twisting away from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) chair: <div class="bookquote">``It'll be your turn next, I wouldn't wonder.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) laughed a little uncertainly. '' Why do you keep on saying that?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) echoed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) laugh. '' I guess I do it to get used to the idea.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) drew up to the table again and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sewed on in silence, with dropped lashes, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) sat in fascinated contemplation of the way in which her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands went up and down above the strip of stuff, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had seen a pair of birds make short perpendicular flights over a nest they were building.
<p/>At length, without turning her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head or lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lids, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said in a low tone: <div class="bookquote">``It's not because you think Zeena's got anything against me, is it?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) former dread started up full-armed at the suggestion. '' Why, what do you mean? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) stammered. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) raised distressed eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) work dropping on the table between them.
<p/>'' I don't know. I thought last night she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to have. '' '' I'd like to know what,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) growled.
<p/>It was the first time they had ever spoken so openly of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attitude toward Mattie, and the repetition of the name seemed to carry it to the farther corners of the room and send it back to them in long repercussions of sound.
<p/>Mattie waited, as if to give the echo time to drop, and then went on: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hasn't said anything to you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mattie/Mattie Silver</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Nobody can tell with Zeena. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) head. '' No, not a word. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tossed the hair back from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forehead with a laugh.
<p/>'' I guess I'm just nervous, then. I'm not going to think about it any more.'' '' Oh, no--don't let's think about it, Matt!
<p/>'' The sudden heat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) tone made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) colour mount again, not with a rush, but gradually, delicately, like the reflection of a thought stealing slowly across her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat silent, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands clasped on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) work, and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) that a warm current flowed toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) along the strip of stuff that still lay unrolled between them.
<p/>A faint vibration of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lashes seemed to show that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) gesture, and that it had sent a counter-current back to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands lie motionless on the other end of the strip.
<p/>Cautiously he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) slid his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) hand palm-downward along the table till his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) finger-tips touched the end of the stuff. As they sat thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) heard a sound behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) head.
<p/>The cat had jumped from Zeena's chair to dart at a mouse in the wainscot, and as a result of the sudden movement the empty chair had set up a spectral rocking.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll be rocking in it herself this time to-morrow,'' Ethan thought. '' I've been in a dream, and this is the only evening we'll ever have together.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) body and brain ached with indescribable weariness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) could think of nothing to say or to do that should arrest the mad flight of the moments.
<p/>'' The return to reality was as painful as the return to consciousness after taking an anaesthetic. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) alteration of mood seemed to have communicated itself to Mattie.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) languidly, as though her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lids were weighted with sleep and it cost her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) an effort to raise them.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) glance fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hand, which now completely covered the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) work and grasped it as if it were a part of herself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) saw a scarcely perceptible tremor cross her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face, and without knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) did he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) stooped his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) head and kissed the bit of stuff in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hold.
<p/>As his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) lips rested on it he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) felt it glide slowly from beneath them, and saw that Mattie had risen and was silently rolling up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) work.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fastened it with a pin, and then, finding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thimble and scissors, put them with the roll of stuff into the box covered with fancy paper which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had once brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from Bettsbridge.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) stood up also, looking vaguely about the room. The clock above the dresser struck eleven. '' Is the fire all right?
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) raised himself again he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was dragging toward the stove the old soap-box lined with carpet in which the cat made its bed.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) recrossed the floor and lifted two of the geranium pots in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms, moving them away from the cold window.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and brought the other geraniums, the hyacinth bulbs in a cracked custard bowl and the German ivy trained over an old croquet hoop.
<p/>When these nightly duties were performed there was nothing left to do but to bring in the tin candlestick from the passage, light the candle and blow out the lamp.
<p/>Ethan put the candlestick in Mattie's hand and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went out of the kitchen ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>), the light that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) carried before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) making her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dark hair look like a drift of mist on the moon.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked in a low voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) opened the door of the stove and poked aimlessly at the embers. ''
<p/>Good night, Matt,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) said as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) foot on the first step of the stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) a moment.
<p/>'' Good night, Ethan,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered, and went up. When the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) room had closed on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had not even touched her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand.
<p/>The next morning at breakfast Jotham Powell was between them, and Ethan tried to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) joy under an air of exaggerated indifference, lounging back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) chair to throw scraps to the cat, growling at the weather, and not so much as offering to help Mattie when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rose to clear away the dishes.
<p/>VI He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) did not know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) was so irrationally happy, for nothing was changed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) life or hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had not even touched the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fingers or looked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) full in the eyes.
<p/>But their evening together had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) a vision of what life at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side might be, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) was glad now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had done nothing to trouble the sweetness of the picture.
<p/>There was a last load of lumber to be hauled to the village, and Jotham Powell--who did not work regularly for Ethan in winter--had <div class="bookquote">``come round''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>to help with the job.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had a fancy that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew what had restrained him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>)... But a wet snow, melting to sleet, had fallen in the night and turned the roads to glass.
<p/>There was more wet in the air and it seemed likely to both men that the weather would <div class="bookquote">``milden''  (<font color='red'><b>both men</b></font>)</div>toward afternoon and make the going safer.
<p/>Ethan therefore proposed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) assistant that they should load the sledge at the wood-lot, as they had done on the previous morning, and put off the <div class="bookquote">``teaming''  (<font color='red'><b>assistant</b></font>)</div>to Starkfield till later in the day.
<p/>This plan had the advantage of enabling him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) to send Jotham to the Flats after dinner to meet Zenobia, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) himself took the lumber down to the village.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) told Jotham to go out and harness up the greys, and for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) and Mattie had the kitchen to themselves.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) had plunged the breakfast dishes into a tin dish-pan and was bending above it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) slim arms bared to the elbow, the steam from the hot water beading her (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) forehead and tightening her (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) rough hair into little brown rings like the tendrils on the traveller's joy.
<p/>Ethan stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) heart in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) throat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wanted to say: ``We shall never be alone again like this.
<p/>Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) reached down his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) tobacco-pouch from a shelf of the dresser, put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) pocket and said: <div class="bookquote">``I guess I can make out to be home for dinner.
<p/>As soon as the sledge was loaded he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) meant to send Jotham back to the farm and hurry on foot into the village to buy the glue for the pickle-dish.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) answered <div class="bookquote">``All right, Ethan,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Zenobia</b></font>) singing over the dishes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) went. With ordinary luck he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) should have had time to carry out this plan; but everything went wrong from the start.
<p/>On the way over to the wood-lot one of the greys slipped on a glare of ice and cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) knee; and when they got him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) up again Jotham had to go back to the barn for a strip of rag to bind the cut.
<p/>Then, when the loading finally began, a sleety rain was coming down once more, and the tree trunks were so slippery that it took twice as long as usual to lift them and get them in place on the sledge.
<p/>It was what Jotham called a sour morning for work, and the horses, shivering and stamping under their wet blankets, seemed to like it as little as the men.
<p/>It was long past the dinner-hour when the job was done, and Ethan had to give up going to the village because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wanted to lead the injured horse home and wash the cut himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) thought that by starting out again with the lumber as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) might get back to the farm with the glue before Jotham and the old sorrel had had time to fetch Zenobia from the Flats; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) knew the chance was a slight one.
<p/>It turned on the state of the roads and on the possible lateness of the Bettsbridge train. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) remembered afterward, with a grim flash of self-derision, what importance he (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) had attached to the weighing of these probabilities...
<p/>As soon as dinner was over he (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) set out again for the wood-lot, not daring to linger till Jotham Powell left.
<p/>The hired man was still drying his (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) wet feet at the stove, and Ethan could only give Mattie a quick look as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) breath:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be back early. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) comprehension; and with that scant solace he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had to trudge off through the rain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had driven his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) load half-way to the village when Jotham Powell overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>), urging the reluctant sorrel toward the Flats.
<p/>I'll have to hurry up to do it,'' Ethan mused, as the sleigh dropped down ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) over the dip of the school-house hill.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) worked like ten at the unloading, and when it was over hastened on to Michael Eady's for the glue.
<p/>Eady and his (<font color='blue'><b>Eady</b></font>) assistant were both <div class="bookquote">``down street,''  (<font color='red'><b>assistant</b></font>)</div>and young Denis, who seldom deigned to take their place, was lounging by the stove with a knot of the golden youth of Starkfield.
<p/>Ethan, consumed with the longing for a last moment alone with Mattie, hung about impatiently while Denis made an ineffectual search in the obscurer corners of the store.
<p/>They hailed Ethan with ironic compliment and offers of conviviality; but no one knew where to find the glue. '' Looks as if we were all sold out.
<p/>But if you'll wait around till the old man comes along maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on it. '' ''
<p/>I'm obliged to you, but I'll try if I can get it down at Mrs. Homan's,'' Ethan answered, burning to be gone.
<p/>Denis's commercial instinct compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) to aver on oath that what Eady's store could not produce would never be found at the widow
<p/>Homan's; but Ethan, heedless of this boast, had already climbed to the sledge and was driving on to the rival establishment.
<p/>Here, after considerable search, and sympathetic questions as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wanted it for, and whether ordinary flour paste wouldn't do as well if she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) couldn't find it, the widow Homan finally hunted down her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) solitary bottle of glue to its hiding-place in a medley of cough-lozenges and corset-laces.
<p/>I hope Zeena ain't broken anything she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) sets store by,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) called after him (<font color='blue'><b>Homan</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Homan</b></font>) turned the greys toward home.
<p/>The fitful bursts of sleet had changed into a steady rain and the horses had heavy work even without a load behind them.
<p/>Once or twice, hearing sleigh-bells, Ethan turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) head, fancying that Zeena and Jotham might overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>); but the old sorrel was not in sight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) face against the rain and urged on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) ponderous pair.
<p/>The barn was empty when the horses turned into it and, after giving them the most perfunctory ministrations they had ever received from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) strode up to the house and pushed open the kitchen door.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was bending over a pan on the stove; but at the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) step she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) turned with a start and sprang to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>'' Mattie was there alone, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had pictured her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). '' See, here, Matt, I've got some stuff to mend the dish with!
<p/>Let me get at it quick,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) cried, waving the bottle in one hand while he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lightly aside; but she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did not seem to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>).
<p/>'' Oh, Ethan--Zeena's come,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said in a whisper, clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) sleeve. They stood and stared at each other, pale as culprits.
<p/>Jotham Powell brought some goods over from the Flats for his (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) drove right on home with them,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) explained.
<p/>'' But the sorrel's not in the barn! '' Ethan stammered. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) gazed blankly about the kitchen, which looked cold and squalid in the rainy winter twilight.
<p/>'' How is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) asked, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) voice to Mattie's whisper. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) uncertainly. '' I don't know.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went right up to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room. '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) didn't say anything?'' <div class="bookquote">``No. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>Ethan let out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) doubts in a low whistle and thrust the bottle back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>'' Don't fret; I'll come down and mend it in the night,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) pulled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wet coat again and went back to the barn to feed the greys.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was there Jotham Powell drove up with the sleigh, and when the horses had been attended to Ethan said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>): ``You might as well come back up for a bite.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was not sorry to assure himself of Jotham's neutralising presence at the supper table, for Zeena was always <div class="bookquote">``nervous''  (<font color='red'><b>Zeena</b></font>)</div>after a journey.
<p/>But the hired man, though seldom loth to accept a meal not included in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wages, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stiff jaws to answer slowly:
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I'm obliged to you, but I guess I'll go along back. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Ethan looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) in surprise. '' Better come up and dry off.
<p/>Jotham's facial muscles were unmoved by this appeal and, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) vocabulary being limited, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) merely repeated: <div class="bookquote">``I guess I'll go along back.
<p/>To Ethan there was something vaguely ominous in this stolid rejection of free food and warmth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wondered what had happened on the drive to nerve Jotham to such stoicism.
<p/>Perhaps Zeena had failed to see the new doctor or had not liked his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) counsels: Ethan knew that in such cases the first person she (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) met was likely to be held responsible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) grievance.
<p/>Looks as if there'd be something hot for supper. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) re-entered the kitchen the lamp lit up the same scene of shining comfort as on the previous evening.
<p/>The table had been as carefully laid, a clear fire glowed in the stove, the cat dozed in its warmth, and Mattie came forward carrying a plate of dough-nuts.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) and Ethan looked at each other in silence; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) had said the night before: <div class="bookquote">``I guess it's about time for supper.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>VII Ethan went out into the passage to hang up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wet garments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) listened for Zeena's step and, not hearing it, called her (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) name up the stairs.
<p/>The room was almost dark, but in the obscurity he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) sitting by the window, bolt upright, and knew by the rigidity of the outline projected against the pane that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) had not taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) travelling dress.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) did not answer, and after a moment's hesitation he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) went up and opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) door. '' Well, Zeena,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) ventured from the threshold.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) did not move, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) continued: <div class="bookquote">``Supper's about ready. Ain't you coming? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) replied: ``I don't feel as if I could touch a morsel.
<p/>It was the consecrated formula, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) expected it to be followed, as usual, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) rising and going down to supper.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) remained seated, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) could think of nothing more felicitous than: <div class="bookquote">``I presume you're tired after the long ride.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) head at this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) answered solemnly: <div class="bookquote">``I'm a great deal sicker than you think. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) words fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) ear with a strange shock of wonder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had often heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) pronounce them before--what if at last they were true? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) advanced a step or two into the dim room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) continued to gaze at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) through the twilight with a mien of wan authority, as of one consciously singled out for a great fate.
<p/>'' I hope that's not so, Zeena,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said. '' I've got complications,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) said. Ethan knew the word for one of exceptional import.
<p/>Almost everybody in the neighbourhood had <div class="bookquote">``troubles,''  (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>frankly localized and specified; but only the chosen had <div class="bookquote">``complications. ''  (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>To have them was in itself a distinction, though it was also, in most cases, a death-warrant.
<p/>People struggled on for years with <div class="bookquote">``troubles,''  (<font color='red'><b>People</b></font>)</div>but they almost always succumbed to <div class="bookquote">``complications. ''  (<font color='red'><b>People</b></font>)</div>Ethan's heart was jerking to and fro between two extremities of feeling, but for the moment compassion prevailed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife looked so hard and lonely, sitting there in the darkness with such thoughts. '' Is that what the new doctor told you?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) asked, instinctively lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) voice.
<p/>Ethan was aware that, in regard to the important question of surgical intervention, the female opinion of the neighbourhood was divided, some glorying in the prestige conferred by operations while others shunned them as indelicate.
<p/>'' Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) says any regular doctor would want me to have an operation. '' Ethan, from motives of economy, had always been glad that Zeena was of the latter faction.
<p/>In the agitation caused by the gravity of her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) announcement he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) sought a consolatory short cut. '' What do you know about this doctor anyway?
<p/>Nobody ever told you that before. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) blunder before she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could take it up: she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wanted sympathy, not consolation.
<p/>'' I didn't need to have anybody tell me I was losing ground every day. Everybody but you could see it.
<p/>And everybody in Bettsbridge knows about Dr. Buck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) office in Worcester, and comes over once a fortnight to Shadd's Falls and Bettsbridge for consultations.
<p/>Eliza Spears was wasting away with kidney trouble before she (<font color='blue'><b>Spears</b></font>) went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Spears</b></font>)'s up and around, and singing in the choir.
<p/>'' '' Well, I'm glad of that. You must do just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) tells you,'' Ethan answered sympathetically. She (<font color='blue'><b>Spears</b></font>) was still looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>'' I mean to,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Spears</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was struck by a new note in her (<font color='blue'><b>Spears</b></font>) voice. It was neither whining nor reproachful, but drily resolute.
<p/>'' What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) want you should do? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) asked, with a mounting vision of fresh expenses. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wants I should have a hired girl.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) says I oughtn't to have to do a single thing around the house. '' <div class="bookquote">``A hired girl? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>Ethan stood transfixed.
<p/>Everybody said I was lucky to get a girl to come away out here, and I agreed to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a dollar extry to make sure.
<p/>'' Yes. And Aunt Martha found me one right off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>)'ll be over to-morrow afternoon. '' Wrath and dismay contended in Ethan.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) no longer believed what Zeena had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) of the supposed seriousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) state: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) expedition to Bettsbridge only a plot hatched between herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) Pierce relations to foist on him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) the cost of a servant; and for the moment wrath predominated.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) had foreseen an immediate demand for money, but not a permanent drain on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) scant resources. '' If you meant to engage a girl you ought to have told me before you started,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pierce</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' How could I tell you before I started? How did I know what Dr. Buck would say?'' '' Oh, Dr. Buck--'' Ethan's incredulity escaped in a short laugh.
<p/>'' Did Dr. Buck tell you how I was to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wages? '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice rose furiously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). ''
<p/>For I'd `a' been ashamed to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) that you grudged me the money to get back my health, when I lost it nursing your own mother!''
<p/>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) didn't. <div class="bookquote">``You lost your health nursing mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes; and my folks all told me at the time you couldn't do no less than marry me after--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Zeena!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Through the obscurity which hid their faces their thoughts seemed to dart at each other like serpents shooting venom.
<p/>Ethan was seized with horror of the scene and shame at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) own share in it. It was as senseless and savage as a physical fight between two enemies in the darkness.
<p/>At first its weak flame made no impression on the shadows; then Zeena's face stood grimly out against the uncurtained pane, which had turned from grey to black.
<p/>It was the first scene of open anger between the couple in their sad seven years together, and Ethan felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had lost an irretrievable advantage in descending to the level of recrimination.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) turned to the shelf above the chimney, groped for matches and lit the one candle in the room. But the practical problem was there and had to be dealt with.
<p/>'' You know I haven't got the money to pay for a girl, Zeena. You'll have to send her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back: I can't do it.''
<p/>'' The doctor says it'll be my death if I go on slaving the way I've had to. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) doesn't understand how I've stood it as long as I have.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Slaving!--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) checked himself again, <div class="bookquote">``You sha'n't lift a hand, if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) says so. I'll do everything round the house myself--''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) broke in: <div class="bookquote">``You're neglecting the farm enough already,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and this being true, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) found no answer, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) time to add ironically: <div class="bookquote">``Better send me over to the almshouse and done with it...
<p/>I guess there's been Fromes there afore now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The taunt burned into him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) let it pass. '' I haven't got the money.
<p/>Then Zeena said in a level voice: <div class="bookquote">``I thought you were to get fifty dollars from Andrew Hale for that lumber.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Zeena</b></font>)</div><p/>That settles it. '' There was a moment's pause in the struggle, as though the combatants were testing their weapons. <div class="bookquote">``Andrew Hale never pays under three months.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) had hardly spoken when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) remembered the excuse he (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) had made for not accompanying his (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) wife to the station the day before; and the blood rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) frowning brows.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Why, you told me yesterday you'd fixed it up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) to pay cash down. You said that was why you couldn't drive me over to the Flats.
<p/>'' Ethan had no suppleness in deceiving. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had never before been convicted of a lie, and all the resources of evasion failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>'' I guess that was a misunderstanding,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) stammered. '' You ain't got the money?'' <div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And you ain't going to get it?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I couldn't know that when I engaged the girl, could I?'' <div class="bookquote">``No. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) paused to control his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) voice.
<p/>'' But you know it now. I'm sorry, but it can't be helped. You're a poor man's wife, Zeena; but I'll do the best I can for you.
<p/>For a while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat motionless, as if reflecting, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arms stretched along the arms of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chair, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes fixed on vacancy.
<p/>'' '' Oh, I guess we'll make out,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said mildly. The change in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tone reassured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' Of course we will!
<p/>There's a whole lot more I can do for you, and Mattie--'' Zeena, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) spoke, seemed to be following out some elaborate mental calculation.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) emerged from it to say: <div class="bookquote">``There'll be Mattie's board less, any how-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Ethan, supposing the discussion to be over, had turned to go down to supper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) stopped short, not grasping what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) heard. '' Mattie's board less--? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) began. Zeena laughed. It was on odd unfamiliar sound--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) did not remember ever having heard her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) laugh before.
<p/>'' You didn't suppose I was going to keep two girls, did you? No wonder you were scared at the expense!
<p/>From the beginning of the discussion he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had instinctively avoided the mention of Mattie's name, fearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hardly knew what: criticism, complaints, or vague allusions to the imminent probability of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) marrying.
<p/>But the thought of a definite rupture had never come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>), and even now could not lodge itself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) mind.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) still had but a confused sense of what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was saying. '' I don't know what you mean,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Mattie Silver's not a hired girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s your relation. '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s a pauper that's hung onto us all after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father'd done his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) best to ruin us.
<p/>As the shrill words shot out Ethan heard a tap on the door, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had drawn shut when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) turned back from the threshold.
<p/>I've kep' her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) here a whole year: it's somebody else's turn now. '' '' Ethan--Zeena!'' Mattie's voice sounded gaily from the landing,
<p/>Inside the room there was a moment's silence; then Zeena called out from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seat: ``I'm not coming down to supper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``do you know what time it is? Supper's been ready half an hour. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' Oh, I'm sorry! Aren't you well?
<p/>Sha'n't I bring you up a bite of something? '' Ethan roused himself with an effort and opened the door. ``Go along down, Matt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``All right!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) quick step on the stairs; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) shut the door and turned back into the room.
<p/>Zeena's just a little tired. I'm coming. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) wife's attitude was unchanged, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face inexorable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) was seized with the despairing sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) helplessness.
<p/>'' You ain't going to do it, Zeena?'' <div class="bookquote">``Do what? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) emitted between flattened lips. '' Send Mattie away--like this?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) continued with rising vehemence: ``You can't put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) out of the house like a thief--a poor girl without friends or money.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never bargained to take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for life!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s done her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) best for you and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s got no place to go to.
<p/>You may forget she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s your kin but everybody else'll remember it. If you do a thing like that what do you suppose folks'll say of you?
<p/>Zeena waited a moment, as if giving him (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) time to feel the full force of the contrast between his (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) own excitement and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) composure.
<p/>'' Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) replied in the same smooth voice: <div class="bookquote">``I know well enough what they say of my having kep' her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) here as long as I have.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Ethan's hand dropped from the door-knob, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had held clenched since he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had drawn the door shut on Mattie.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had meant to humble himself, to argue that Mattie's keep didn't cost much, after all, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) could make out to buy a stove and fix up a place in the attic for the hired girl--but Zeena's words revealed the peril of such pleadings.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wife's retort was like a knife-cut across the sinews and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) felt suddenly weak and powerless. '' You mean to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s got to go--at once?
<p/>As if trying to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) see reason she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) replied impartially: <div class="bookquote">``The girl will be over from Bettsbridge to-morrow, and I presume she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s got to have somewheres to sleep.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was no longer the listless creature who had lived at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) side in a state of sullen self-absorption, but a mysterious alien presence, an evil energy secreted from the long years of silent brooding.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) faltered out, in terror of letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wife complete her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sentence. '' Ethan looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with loathing. It was the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) helplessness that sharpened his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) antipathy.
<p/>There had never been anything in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that one could appeal to; but as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) could ignore and command he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had remained indifferent.
<p/>Mattie was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) relation, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>): there were no means by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) could compel her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to keep the girl under her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) roof.
<p/>All the long misery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) baffled past, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) youth of failure, hardship and vain effort, rose up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) soul in bitterness and seemed to take shape before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) in the woman who at every turn had barred his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) way.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had taken everything else from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>); and now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meant to take the one thing that made up for all the others.
<p/>For a moment such a flame of hate rose in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) that it ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) arm and clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) fist against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had mastered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) abhorred her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) took a wild step forward and then stopped. '' You're--you're not coming down?
<p/>I guess I'll lay down on the bed a little while,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered mildly; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) turned and walked out of the room.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) said in a bewildered voice. '' No. In the kitchen Mattie was sitting by the stove, the cat curled up on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sprang to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet as Ethan entered and carried the covered dish of meat-pie to the table. '' I hope Zeena isn't sick?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked. '' No. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shone at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) across the table. '' Well, sit right down then. You must be starving.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uncovered the pie and pushed it over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>). So they were to have one more evening together , her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) happy eyes seemed to say!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) helped himself mechanically and began to eat; then disgust took him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) by the throat and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) fork.
<p/>Mattie's tender gaze was on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) marked the gesture. '' Why, Ethan, what's the matter? Don't it taste right?''
<p/>'' Yes--it's first-rate. Only I--'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) plate away, rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) chair, and walked around the table to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed to melt against him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) terror, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) arms, held her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fast there, felt her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lashes beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) cheek like netted butterflies.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) started up with frightened eyes. '' Ethan, there's something wrong! I knew there was!'' '' What is it--what is it?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stammered; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips at last and was drinking unconsciousness of everything but the joy they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lingered a moment, caught in the same strong current; then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) slipped from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) and drew back a step or two, pale and troubled.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) look smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) with compunction, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) cried out, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drowning in a dream: <div class="bookquote">``You can't go, Matt!
<p/>The words went on sounding between them as though a torch of warning flew from hand to hand through a black landscape.
<p/>I'll never let you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go--go? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stammered. '' Must I go? '' Ethan was overcome with shame at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) lack of self-control in flinging the news at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so brutally.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) head reeled and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had to support himself against the table. All the while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) were still kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and yet dying of thirst for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips.
<p/>'' Ethan, what has happened? Is Zeena mad with me?'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cry steadied him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>), though it deepened his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wrath and pity.
<p/>'' No, no,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it's not that. But this new doctor has scared her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) about herself. You know she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) believes all they say the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sees them.
<p/>And this one's told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) won't get well unless she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lays up and don't do a thing about the house--not for months--''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was so small and weak-looking that it wrung his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) heart; but suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head and looked straight at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) paused, his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes wandering from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) miserably. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood silent a moment, drooping before him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) like a broken branch. ''
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants somebody handier in my place? Is that it?'' '' That's what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says to-night.'' '' If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says it to-night she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll say it to-morrow.
<p/>Both bowed to the inexorable truth: they knew that Zeena never changed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind, and that in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) case a resolve once taken was equivalent to an act performed.
<p/>'' There was a long silence between them; then Mattie said in a low voice: <div class="bookquote">``Don't be too sorry, Ethan.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mattie/Mattie Silver</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Oh, God-- oh, God,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) groaned. The glow of passion he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had melted to an aching tenderness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) quick lids beating back the tears, and longed to take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) arms and soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). ''
<p/>You're letting your supper get cold,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) admonished him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with a pale gleam of gaiety. '' Oh, Matt--Matt-- where'll you go to?
<p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lids sank and a tremor crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) saw that for the first time the thought of the future came to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) distinctly.
<p/>I might get something to do over at Stamford,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) faltered, as if knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no hope.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) dropped back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) seat and hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) hands. Despair seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) at the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) setting out alone to renew the weary quest for work.
<p/>In the only place where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was known she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was surrounded by indifference or animosity; and what chance had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), inexperienced and untrained, among the million bread-seekers of the cities?
<p/>There came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) miserable tales he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) had heard at Worcester, and the faces of girls whose lives had begun as hopefully as Mattie's....
<p/>It was not possible to think of such things without a revolt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) whole being. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) sprang up suddenly. ''
<p/>You can't go, Matt! I won't let you! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s always had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way, but I mean to have mine now-- ''
<p/>Mattie lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand with a quick gesture, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wife's step behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>). Zeena came into the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dragging down-at-the-heel step, and quietly took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) accustomed seat between them.
<p/>I felt a little mite better, and Dr. Buck says I ought to eat all I can to keep my strength up, even if I ain't got any appetite,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flat whine, reaching across Mattie for the teapot.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``good''  (<font color='red'><b>the calico shawl</b></font>)</div>dress had been replaced by the black calico and brown knitted shawl which formed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daily wear, and with them she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had put on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) usual face and manner.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poured out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tea, added a great deal of milk to it, helped herself largely to pie and pickles, and made the familiar gesture of adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) false teeth before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to eat.
<p/>The cat rubbed itself ingratiatingly against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Good Pussy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>stooped to stroke it and gave it a scrap of meat from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) plate.
<p/>Ethan sat speechless, not pretending to eat, but Mattie nibbled valiantly at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) food and asked Zeena one or two questions about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) visit to Bettsbridge.
<p/>Zeena answered in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) every-day tone and, warming to the theme, regaled them with several vivid descriptions of intestinal disturbances among her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friends and relatives.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked straight at Mattie as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke, a faint smile deepening the vertical lines between her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nose and chin.
<p/>When supper was over she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seat and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand to the flat surface over the region of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart.
<p/>'' That pie of yours always sets a mite heavy, Matt,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, not ill-naturedly. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seldom abbreviated the girl's name, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did so it was always a sign of affability.
<p/>I've a good mind to go and hunt up those stomach powders I got last year over in Springfield,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) continued.
<p/>'' '' I ain't tried them for quite a while, and maybe they'll help the heartburn. '' Mattie lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' Can't I get them for you, Zeena? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ventured. '' No. They're in a place you don't know about,'' Zeena answered darkly, with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) secret looks.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went out of the kitchen and Mattie, rising, began to clear the dishes from the table. As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passed Ethan's chair their eyes met and clung together desolately.
<p/>The cat had sprung to Zeena's rocking-chair, and the heat of the fire was beginning to draw out the faint sharp scent of the geraniums.
<p/>The warm still kitchen looked as peaceful as the night before. Ethan dragged himself wearily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) feet. '' I'll go out and take a look around,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said, going toward the passage to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) lantern.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) reached the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) met Zeena coming back into the room, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips twitching with anger, a flush of excitement on her (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>) sallow face.
<p/>The shawl had slipped from her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) shoulders and was dragging at her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) down-trodden heels, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) hands she (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) carried the fragments of the red glass pickle-dish.
<p/>There was no answer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) continued in a trembling voice: <div class="bookquote">``I went to get those powders I'd put away in father's old spectacle-case, top of the china-closet, where I keep the things I set store by, so's folks shan't meddle with them--''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I'd like to know who done this,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>) said, looking sternly from Ethan to Mattie. Her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) voice broke, and two small tears hung on her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) lashless lids and ran slowly down her (<font color='blue'><b>She</b></font>) cheeks.
<p/>It takes the stepladder to get at the top shelf, and I put Aunt Philura Maple's pickle-dish up there o' purpose when we was married, and it's never been down since, `cept for the spring cleaning, and then I always lifted it with my own hands,
<p/>'' so's 't it shouldn't get broke. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) laid the fragments reverently on the table. '' I want to know who done this,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) quavered.
<p/>At the challenge Ethan turned back into the room and faced her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>). '' I can tell you, then. The cat done it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The cat?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' That's what I said. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hard, and then turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) eyes to Mattie, who was carrying the dish-pan to the table.
<p/>'' I'd like to know how the cat got into my china-closet''' she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) said. '' Chasin' mice, I guess,'' Ethan rejoined.
<p/>'' There was a mouse round the kitchen all last evening. '' Zeena continued to look from one to the other; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) emitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) small strange laugh.
<p/>I knew the cat was a smart cat,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) said in a high voice, ``but I didn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was smart enough to pick up the pieces of my pickle-dish and lay 'em edge to edge on the very shelf he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) knocked 'em off of.
<p/>The cat did break the dish; but I got it down from the china-closet, and I'm the one to blame for its getting broken.
<p/>Zeena stood beside the ruin of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) treasure, stiffening into a stony image of resentment, <div class="bookquote">``You got down my pickle-dish-what for?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Zeena</b></font>)</div>'' Mattie suddenly drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) arms out of the steaming water. '' It wasn't Ethan's fault, Zeena! '' '' A bright flush flew to Mattie's cheeks.
<p/>You wanted to make the supper-table pretty; and you waited till my back was turned, and took the thing I set most store by of anything I've got, and wouldn't never use it, not even when the minister come to dinner, or Aunt Martha Pierce come over from Bettsbridge--
<p/>'' I wanted to make the supper-table pretty,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) said. '' '' Zeena paused with a gasp, as if terrified by her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) own evocation of the sacrilege.
<p/>It's the way your father begun, and I was warned of it when I took you, and I tried to keep my things where you couldn't get at 'em--and now you've took from me the one I cared for most of all--
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) broke off in a short spasm of sobs that passed and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) more than ever like a shape of stone.
<p/>If I'd `a' listened to folks, you'd `a' gone before now, and this wouldn't `a' happened,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) said; and gathering up the bits of broken glass she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) went out of the room as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) carried a dead body...
<p/>When Ethan was called back to the farm by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) father's illness his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) mother gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) own use, a small room behind the untenanted ``best parlour.
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had nailed up shelves for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) books, built himself a box-sofa out of boards and a mattress, laid out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) papers on a kitchen-table, hung on the rough plaster wall an engraving of Abraham Lincoln and a calendar with <div class="bookquote">``Thoughts from the Poets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Abraham</b></font>)</div>and tried, with these meagre properties, to produce some likeness to the study of a <div class="bookquote">``minister''  (<font color='red'><b>Abraham</b></font>)</div>who had been kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) and lent him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) books when he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) was at Worcester.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) still took refuge there in summer, but when Mattie came to live at the farm he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) stove, and consequently the room was uninhabitable for several months of the year.
<p/>To this retreat he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) descended as soon as the house was quiet, and Zeena's steady breathing from the bed had assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) that there was to be no sequel to the scene in the kitchen.
<p/>'' You're a bad girl, Mattie Silver, and I always known it. '' '' VIII '' After Zeena's departure he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) and Mattie had stood speechless, neither seeking to approach the other.
<p/>Then the girl had returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) task of clearing up the kitchen for the night and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) lantern and gone on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) usual round outside the house.
<p/>The kitchen was empty when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) came back to it; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) tobacco-pouch and pipe had been laid on the table, and under them was a scrap of paper torn from the back of a seedsman's catalogue, on which three words were written:
<p/>Going into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) cold dark <div class="bookquote">``study''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) placed the lantern on the table and, stooping to its light, read the message again and again.
<p/>It was the first time that Mattie had ever written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>), and the possession of the paper gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) a strange new sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) nearness; yet it deepened his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) anguish by reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) that henceforth they would have no other way of communicating with each other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't trouble, Ethan. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>For the life of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) smile, the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) voice, only cold paper and dead words!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was too young, too strong, too full of the sap of living, to submit so easily to the destruction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hopes.
<p/>Confused motions of rebellion stormed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>). Must he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wear out all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) years at the side of a bitter querulous woman?
<p/>Other possibilities had been in him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>), possibilities sacrificed, one by one, to Zeena's narrow-mindedness and ignorance. And what good had come of it?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a hundred times bitterer and more discontented than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had married her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): the one pleasure left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was to inflict pain on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>All the healthy instincts of self-defence rose up in him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) against such waste... He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) bundled himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) old coon-skin coat and lay down on the box-sofa to think.
<p/>It was a cushion which Zeena had made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) when they were engaged--the only piece of needlework he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had ever seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) do.
<p/>Under his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) cheek he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) felt a hard object with strange protuberances. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) flung it across the floor and propped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) head against the wall...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) knew a case of a man over the mountain--a young fellow of about his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own age--who had escaped from just such a life of misery by going West with the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cared for.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wife had divorced him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had married the girl and prospered. Ethan had seen the couple the summer before at Shadd's Falls, where they had come to visit relatives.
<p/>They had a little girl with fair curls, who wore a gold locket and was dressed like a princess. The deserted wife had not done badly either.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband had given her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the farm and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had managed to sell it, and with that and the alimony she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had started a lunch-room at Bettsbridge and bloomed into activity and importance.
<p/>Ethan was fired by the thought. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) not leave with Mattie the next day, instead of letting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) go alone?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) would hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) valise under the seat of the sleigh, and Zeena would suspect nothing till she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went upstairs for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) afternoon nap and found a letter on the bed...
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) impulses were still near the surface, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) sprang up, re-lit the lantern, and sat down at the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) rummaged in the drawer for a sheet of paper, found one, and began to write.
<p/>'' Zeena, I've done all I could for you, and I don't see as it's been any use. I don't blame you, nor I don't blame myself.
<p/>Maybe both of us will do better separate. I'm going to try my luck West, and you can sell the farm and mill, and keep the money--''
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) pen paused on the word, which brought home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) the relentless conditions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) lot. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) gave the farm and mill to Zeena what would be left him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) to start his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) own life with?
<p/>Once in the West he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was sure of picking up work--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) would not have feared to try his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) chance alone. But with Mattie depending on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) the case was different.
<p/>Farm and mill were mortgaged to the limit of their value, and even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) found a purchaser--in itself an unlikely chance--it was doubtful if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) could clear a thousand dollars on the sale.
<p/>It was only by incessant labour and personal supervision that Ethan drew a meagre living from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) land, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) were in better health than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) imagined, could never carry such a burden alone.
<p/>And what of Zeena's fate? Meanwhile, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) keep the farm going? Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) people, then, and see what they would do for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>By the time she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had discovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) whereabouts, and brought suit for divorce, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) would probably--wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was--be earning enough to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a sufficient alimony.
<p/>It was the fate she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was forcing on Mattie--why not let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) try it herself? And the alternative was to let Mattie go forth alone, with far less hope of ultimate provision...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had scattered the contents of the table-drawer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) search for a sheet of paper, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) pen his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) eye fell on an old copy of the Bettsbridge Eagle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) drew the lantern nearer and eagerly scanned the fares; then the paper fell from his (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) hand and he (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) pushed aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) unfinished letter.
<p/>A moment ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) had wondered what he (<font color='blue'><b>Eagle</b></font>) and Mattie were to live on when they reached the West; now he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had not even the money to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) there.
<p/>Borrowing was out of the question: six months before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) only security to raise funds for necessary repairs to the mill, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) knew that without security no one at Starkfield would lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) ten dollars.
<p/>The advertising sheet was folded uppermost, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) read the seductive words: <div class="bookquote">``Trips to the West: Reduced Rates. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The inexorable facts closed in on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) like prison-warders handcuffing a convict.
<p/>There was no way out--none. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) was a prisoner for life, and now his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) one ray of light was to be extinguished.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) crept back heavily to the sofa, stretching himself out with limbs so leaden that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) felt as if they would never move again.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) lay there, the window-pane that faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>), growing gradually lighter, inlaid upon the darkness a square of moon-suffused sky.
<p/>A crooked tree-branch crossed it, a branch of the apple-tree under which, on summer evenings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had sometimes found Mattie sitting when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) came up from the mill.
<p/>Tears rose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) throat and slowly burned their way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) lids. Slowly the rim of the rainy vapours caught fire and burnt away, and a pure moon swung into the blue.
<p/>This was the night on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) was to have taken Mattie coasting, and there hung the lamp to light them!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) looked out at the slopes bathed in lustre, the silver-edged darkness of the woods, the spectral purple of the hills against the sky, and it seemed as though all the beauty of the night had been poured out to mock his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wretchedness...
<p/>Ethan, rising on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) elbow, watched the landscape whiten and shape itself under the sculpture of the moon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) fell asleep, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) woke the chill of the winter dawn was in the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) felt cold and stiff and hungry, and ashamed of being hungry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) eyes and went to the window.
<p/>A red sun stood over the grey rim of the fields, behind trees that looked black and brittle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) said to himself: <div class="bookquote">``This is Matt's last day,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and tried to think what the place would be without her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) stood there he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) heard a step behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) entered. '' Oh, Ethan--were you here all night? ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) looked so small and pinched, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) poor dress, with the red scarf wound about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>), and the cold light turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) paleness sallow, that Ethan stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) without speaking.
<p/>'' You must be frozen,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) went on, fixing lustreless eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) drew a step nearer. '' How did you know I was here?''
<p/>Because I heard you go down stairs again after I went to bed, and I listened all night, and you didn't come up.
<p/>'' '' All his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) tenderness rushed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) and said: <div class="bookquote">``I'll come right along and make up the kitchen fire.
<p/>They went back to the kitchen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) fetched the coal and kindlings and cleared out the stove for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) brought in the milk and the cold remains of the meat-pie.
<p/>When warmth began to radiate from the stove, and the first ray of sunlight lay on the kitchen floor, Ethan's dark thoughts melted in the mellower air.
<p/>The sight of Mattie going about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) work as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) on so many mornings made it seem impossible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) should ever cease to be a part of the scene.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) said to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had doubtless exaggerated the significance of Zeena's threats, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) too, with the return of daylight, would come to a saner mood.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) went up to Mattie as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) bent above the stove, and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) arm. '' I don't want you should trouble either,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) said, looking down into her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) eyes with a smile.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) flushed up warmly and whispered back: <div class="bookquote">``No, Ethan, I ain't going to trouble. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I guess things'll straighten out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) added.
<p/>There was no answer but a quick throb of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) lids, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) ain't said anything this morning?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No. I haven't seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) yet. '' <div class="bookquote">``Don't you take any notice when you do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With this injunction he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) and went out to the cow-barn.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) saw Jotham Powell walking up the hill through the morning mist, and the familiar sight added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) growing conviction of security.
<p/>As the two men were clearing out the stalls Jotham rested on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) pitch-fork to say: ``Dan'l Byrne's goin' over to the Flats to-day noon, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Byrne</b></font>) c'd take Mattie's trunk along, and make it easier ridin' when I take her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) over in the sleigh.
<p/>Ethan looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) blankly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) continued: ``Mis' Frome said the new girl'd be at the Flats at five, and I was to take Mattie then, so's 't she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could ketch the six o'clock train for Stamford.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had to wait a moment before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) could find voice to say: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, it ain't so sure about Mattie's going--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Ethan felt the blood drumming in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) temples. '' <div class="bookquote">``That so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jotham Powell/Jotham</b></font>)</div>said Jotham indifferently; and they went on with their work.
<p/>When they returned to the kitchen the two women were already at breakfast. Zeena had an air of unusual alertness and activity.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drank two cups of coffee and fed the cat with the scraps left in the pie-dish; then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seat and, walking over to the window, snipped two or three yellow leaves from the geraniums.
<p/>Aunt Martha's ain't got a faded leaf on 'em; but they pine away when they ain't cared for,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said reflectively.
<p/>'' Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) turned to Jotham and asked: <div class="bookquote">``What time'd you say Dan'l Byrne'd be along?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The hired man threw a hesitating glance at Ethan.
<p/>That trunk of yours is too heavy for the sleigh, and Dan'l Byrne'll be round to take it over to the Flats,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Round about noon,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Byrne</b></font>) said. Zeena turned to Mattie. '' '' I'm much obliged to you, Zeena,'' said Mattie. ''
<p/>I know there's a huckabuck towel missing; and I can't make out what you done with that match-safe 't used to stand behind the stuffed owl in the parlour.
<p/>I'd like to go over things with you first,'' Zeena continued in an unperturbed voice. '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) went out, followed by Mattie, and when the men were alone
<p/>Ethan finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) usual morning tasks about the house and barn; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said to Jotham: ``I'm going down to Starkfield.
<p/>Jotham said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) employer: <div class="bookquote">``I guess I better let Dan'l come round, then. ''  (<font color='red'><b>employer</b></font>)</div>Tell them not to wait dinner.
<p/>That which had seemed incredible in the sober light of day had really come to pass, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) was to assist as a helpless spectator at Mattie's banishment.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) manhood was humbled by the part he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) was compelled to play and by the thought of what Mattie must think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/>'' The passion of rebellion had broken out in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) again. Confused impulses struggled in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) strode along to the village.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) mind to do something, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) did not know what it would be. The early mist had vanished and the fields lay like a silver shield under the sun.
<p/>Every yard of the road was alive with Mattie's presence, and there was hardly a branch against the sky or a tangle of brambles on the bank in which some bright shred of memory was not caught.
<p/>Once, in the stillness, the call of a bird in a mountain ash was so like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) laughter that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) heart tightened and then grew large; and all these things made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) see that something must be done at once.
<p/>Suddenly it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) that Andrew Hale, who was a kind-hearted man, might be induced to reconsider his (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) refusal and advance a small sum on the lumber if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) were told that Zeena's ill-health made it necessary to hire a servant.
<p/>Hale, after all, knew enough of Ethan's situation to make it possible for the latter to renew his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) appeal without too much loss of pride; and, moreover, how much did pride count in the ebullition of passions in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) breast?
<p/>It was one of the days when the glitter of winter shines through a pale haze of spring. The more he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) plan the more hopeful it seemed.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) could get Mrs. Hale's ear he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) felt certain of success, and with fifty dollars in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) pocket nothing could keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) from Mattie...
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) first object was to reach Starkfield before Hale had started for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) work; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) knew the carpenter had a job down the Corbury road and was likely to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) house early.
<p/>Ethan's long strides grew more rapid with the accelerated beat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) thoughts, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) reached the foot of School House Hill he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) caught sight of Hale's sleigh in the distance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hurried forward to meet it, but as it drew nearer he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) saw that it was driven by the carpenter's youngest boy and that the figure at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) side, looking like a large upright cocoon in spectacles, was that of Mrs. Hale.
<p/>Ethan signed to them to stop, and Mrs. Hale leaned forward, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) pink wrinkles twinkling with benevolence. '' Mr. Hale? Why, yes, you'll find him (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) down home now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) woke up with a touch o' lumbago, and I just made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) put on one of old Dr. Kidder's plasters and set right up into the fire.
<p/>Beaming maternally on Ethan, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) bent over to add: <div class="bookquote">``I on'y just heard from Mr. Hale `bout Zeena's going over to Bettsbridge to see that new doctor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) ain't going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) work this forenoon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I'm real sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>)'s feeling so bad again! I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) can do something for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>).
<p/>I always tell Mr. Hale I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>)'d `a' done if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) hadn't `a' had you to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>); and I used to say the same thing `bout your mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) a last nod of sympathy while her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) son chirped to the horse; and Ethan, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) drove off, stood in the middle of the road and stared after the retreating sleigh.
<p/>I don't know anybody round here's had more sickness than Zeena. You've had an awful mean time, Ethan Frome. '' It was a long time since any one had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) as kindly as Mrs. Hale.
<p/>Most people were either indifferent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) troubles, or disposed to think it natural that a young fellow of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) age should have carried without repining the burden of three crippled lives.
<p/>But Mrs. Hale had said, <div class="bookquote">``You've had an awful mean time, Ethan Frome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hale/Hale/Ned</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) felt less alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) misery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) started down the road toward their house, but at the end of a few yards he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) pulled up sharply, the blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) face.
<p/>For the first time, in the light of the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) had just heard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) saw what he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) was about to do.
<p/>If the Hales were sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>) they would surely respond to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>) appeal... He (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>) was planning to take advantage of the Hales' sympathy to obtain money from them on false pretences.
<p/>With the sudden perception of the point to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>) madness had carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>), the madness fell and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>) life before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>) as it was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>) was a poor man, the husband of a sickly woman, whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>) desertion would leave alone and destitute; and even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>) had had the heart to desert her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>) could have done so only by deceiving two kindly people who had pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>).
<p/>That was a plain statement of the cloudy purpose which had driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>) in headlong to Starkfield. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hales</b></font>) turned and walked slowly back to the farm.
<p/>At the kitchen door Daniel Byrne sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Byrne</b></font>) sleigh behind a big-boned grey who pawed the snow and swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Byrne</b></font>) long head restlessly from side to side.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head was wrapped in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shawl, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was reading a book called <div class="bookquote">``Kidney Troubles and Their Cure''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Byrne</b></font>) had had to pay extra postage only a few days before.
<p/>IX Ethan went into the kitchen and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife by the stove. Zeena did not move or look up when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) entered, and after a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) asked: <div class="bookquote">``Where's Mattie?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Without lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes from the page she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) replied: <div class="bookquote">``I presume she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s getting down her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) trunk. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The blood rushed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' Getting down her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) trunk--alone?'' <div class="bookquote">``Jotham Powell's down in the wood-lot, and Dan'l Byrne says he (<font color='blue'><b>Byrne</b></font>) darsn't leave that horse,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) returned.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, without stopping to hear the end of the phrase, had left the kitchen and sprung up the stairs. The door of Mattie's room was shut, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wavered a moment on the landing.
<p/>'' Matt,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) said in a low voice; but there was no answer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) hand on the door-knob.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) had never been in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room except once, in the early summer, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) had gone there to plaster up a leak in the eaves, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) remembered exactly how everything had looked:
<p/>the red-and-white quilt on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) narrow bed, the pretty pin-cushion on the chest of drawers, and over it the enlarged photograph of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother, in an oxydized frame, with a bunch of dyed grasses at the back.
<p/>Now these and all other tokens of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) presence had vanished, and the room looked as bare and comfortless as when Zeena had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) into it on the day of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arrival.
<p/>In the middle of the floor stood her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) trunk, and on the trunk she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) Sunday dress, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) back turned to the door and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not heard Ethan's call because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was sobbing and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) step till he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) stood close behind her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>'' Matt--oh, don't-- oh, Matt! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) started up, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wet face to his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>). '' Ethan--I thought I wasn't ever going to see you again!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) arms, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) close, and with a trembling hand smoothed away the hair from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>'' '' Not see me again? What do you mean? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sobbed out: ``Jotham said you told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) we wasn't to wait dinner for you, and I thought--
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) without answering, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) lips on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hair, which was soft yet springy, like certain mosses on warm slopes, and had the faint woody fragrance of fresh sawdust in the sun.
<p/>Through the door they heard Zeena's voice calling out from below: <div class="bookquote">``Dan'l Byrne says you better hurry up if you want him (<font color='blue'><b>Byrne</b></font>) to take that trunk.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Zeena</b></font>)</div>'' You thought I meant to cut it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Byrne</b></font>) finished for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) grimly. '' They drew apart with stricken faces.
<p/>Words of resistance rushed to Ethan's lips and died there. Mattie found her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) handkerchief and dried her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes; then, bending down, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) took hold of a handle of the trunk.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``It takes two to coax it round the corner'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>; and submitting to this argument he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) grasped the other handle, and together they manoeuvred the heavy trunk out to the landing. ''
<p/>Now let go,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) repeated; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) shouldered the trunk and carried it down the stairs and across the passage to the kitchen.
<p/>Zeena, who had gone back to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seat by the stove, did not lift her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) book as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) passed.
<p/>Ethan put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) aside. '' You let go, Matt,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Mattie followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) out of the door and helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) to lift the trunk into the back of the sleigh.
<p/>When it was in place they stood side by side on the door-step, watching Daniel Byrne plunge off behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Byrne</b></font>) fidgety horse.
<p/>It seemed to Ethan that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) heart was bound with cords which an unseen hand was tightening with every tick of the clock.
<p/>Twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) lips to speak to Mattie and found no breath. At length, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) turned to re-enter the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) laid a detaining hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>'' I'm going to drive you over, Matt,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) whispered. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) murmured back: <div class="bookquote">``I think Zeena wants I should go with Jotham.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' I'm going to drive you over,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jotham</b></font>) repeated; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went into the kitchen without answering. At dinner Ethan could not eat.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) eyes they rested on Zeena's pinched face, and the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) straight lips seemed to quiver away into a smile.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ate well, declaring that the mild weather made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feel better, and pressed a second helping of beans on Jotham Powell, whose wants she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) generally ignored.
<p/>Zeena, after feeding the cat, had returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rocking-chair by the stove, and Jotham Powell, who always lingered last, reluctantly pushed back his (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) chair and moved toward the door.
<p/>Mattie, when the meal was over, went about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) usual task of clearing the table and washing up the dishes. On the threshold he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) turned back to say to Ethan: <div class="bookquote">``What time'll
<p/>I come round for Mattie? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>Ethan was standing near the window, mechanically filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) pipe while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) watched Mattie move to and fro.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``You needn't come round; I'm going to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) over myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) saw the rise of the colour in Mattie's averted cheek, and the quick lifting of Zeena's head.
<p/>'' I want you should stay here this afternoon, Ethan,'' his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife said. '' Jotham can drive Mattie over. '' Mattie flung an imploring glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) repeated curtly: <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) over myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Zeena continued in the same even tone: <div class="bookquote">``I wanted you should stay and fix up that stove in Mattie's room afore the girl gets here.
<p/>It ain't been drawing right for nigh on a month now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Zeena</b></font>)</div>Ethan's voice rose indignantly. '' If it was good enough for Mattie
<p/>That girl that's coming told me she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was used to a house where they had a furnace,'' Zeena persisted with the same monotonous mildness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d better ha' stayed there then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) flung back at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and turning to Mattie he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) added in a hard voice: <div class="bookquote">``You be ready by three, Matt; I've got business at Corbury.
<p/>I guess it's good enough for a hired girl.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Jotham Powell had started for the barn, and Ethan strode down after him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) aflame with anger.
<p/>The pulses in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) temples throbbed and a fog was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) went about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) task without knowing what force directed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>), or whose hands and feet were fulfilling its orders.
<p/>It was not till he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) led out the sorrel and backed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) between the shafts of the sleigh that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) once more became conscious of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was doing.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) passed the bridle over the horse's head, and wound the traces around the shafts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) remembered the day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had made the same preparations in order to drive over and meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) wife's cousin at the Flats.
<p/>It was little more than a year ago, on just such a soft afternoon, with a <div class="bookquote">``feel''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>of spring in the air.
<p/>The sorrel, turning the same big ringed eye on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>), nuzzled the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hand in the same way; and one by one all the days between rose up and stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>)...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) flung the bearskin into the sleigh, climbed to the seat, and drove up to the house. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) entered the kitchen it was empty, but Mattie's bag and shawl lay ready by the door.
<p/>No sound reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) from above, but presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) heard some one moving about in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) deserted study, and pushing open the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) saw Mattie, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hat and jacket, standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) near the table.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) went to the foot of the stairs and listened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) started at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) approach and turning quickly, said: <div class="bookquote">``Is it time?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What are you doing here, Matt? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) timidly. '' I was just taking a look round--that's all,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) answered, with a wavering smile.
<p/>They went back into the kitchen without speaking, and Ethan picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) bag and shawl. '' Where's Zeena? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) asked.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) went upstairs right after dinner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had those shooting pains again, and didn't want to be disturbed.''
<p/>Ethan, looking slowly about the kitchen, said to himself with a shudder that in a few hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) would be returning to it alone.
<p/>Then the sense of unreality overcame him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) once more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) could not bring himself to believe that Mattie stood there for the last time before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) say good-bye to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No. That was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said. '' <div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) said almost gaily, opening the door and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) bag into the sleigh.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) seat and bent over to tuck the rug about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) slipped into the place at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) side.
<p/>Now then, go `long,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) said, with a shake of the reins that sent the sorrel placidly jogging down the hill.
<p/>'' '' We got lots of time for a good ride, Matt! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) cried, seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hand beneath the fur and pressing it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) face tingled and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) felt dizzy, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) had stopped in at the Starkfield saloon on a zero day for a drink.
<p/>Mattie sat silent, giving no sign of surprise; but after a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Are you going round by Shadow Pond?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At the gate, instead of making for Starkfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) turned the sorrel to the right, up the Bettsbridge road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) laughed and answered: <div class="bookquote">``I knew you'd know!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) drew closer under the bearskin, so that, looking sideways around his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) coat -sleeve, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) could just catch the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) nose and a blown brown wave of hair.
<p/>They drove slowly up the road between fields glistening under the pale sun, and then bent to the right down a lane edged with spruce and larch.
<p/>Ahead of them, a long way off, a range of hills stained by mottlings of black forest flowed away in round white curves against the sky.
<p/>As they entered it the breeze fell and a warm stillness seemed to drop from the branches with the dropping needles.
<p/>Here the snow was so pure that the tiny tracks of wood-animals had left on it intricate lace-like patterns, and the bluish cones caught in its surface stood out like ornaments of bronze.
<p/>Ethan drove on in silence till they reached a part of the wood where the pines were more widely spaced; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) drew up and helped Mattie to get out of the sleigh.
<p/>They passed between the aromatic trunks, the snow breaking crisply under their feet, till they came to a small sheet of water with steep wooded sides.
<p/>Across its frozen surface, from the farther bank, a single hill rising against the western sun threw the long conical shadow which gave the lake its name.
<p/>The lane passed into a pine-wood with boles reddening in the afternoon sun and delicate blue shadows on the snow. It was a shy secret spot, full of the same dumb melancholy that Ethan felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) looked up and down the little pebbly beach till his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) eye lit on a fallen tree-trunk half submerged in snow.
<p/>The entertainment of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) spoke was one of the few that they had taken part in together: a <div class="bookquote">``church picnic''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which, on a long afternoon of the preceding summer, had filled the retired place with merry-making.
<p/>'' There's where we sat at the picnic,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>). Mattie had begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had refused.
<p/>Then, toward sunset, coming down from the mountain where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had been felling timber, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had been caught by some strayed revellers and drawn into the group by the lake, where Mattie, encircled by facetious youths, and bright as a blackberry under her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) spreading hat, was brewing coffee over a gipsy fire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) remembered the shyness he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had felt at approaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) uncouth clothes, and then the lighting up of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) face, and the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had broken through the group to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) with a cup in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) hand.
<p/>They had sat for a few minutes on the fallen log by the pond, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) gold locket, and set the young men searching for it; and it was Ethan who had spied it in the moss....
<p/>That was all; but all their intercourse had been made up of just such inarticulate flashes, when they seemed to come suddenly upon happiness as if they had surprised a butterfly in the winter woods...
<p/>'' It was right there I found your locket,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said, pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) foot into a dense tuft of blueberry bushes.
<p/>'' I never saw anybody with such sharp eyes! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) answered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) sat down on the tree-trunk in the sun and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>'' You were as pretty as a picture in that pink hat,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) laughed with pleasure. '' Oh, I guess it was the hat!
<p/>They had never before avowed their inclination so openly, and Ethan, for a moment, had the illusion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was a free man, wooing the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) meant to marry.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair and longed to touch it again, and to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that it smelt of the woods; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had never learned to say such things.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rejoined. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet and said: <div class="bookquote">``We mustn't stay here any longer. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) continued to gaze at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) vaguely, only half-roused from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) dream.
<p/>They stood looking at each other as if the eyes of each were straining to absorb and hold fast the other's image.
<p/>There were things he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) before they parted, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) could not say them in that place of summer memories, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) turned and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in silence to the sleigh.
<p/>'' There's plenty of time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) answered. As they drove away the sun sank behind the hill and the pine-boles turned from red to grey.
<p/>By a devious track between the fields they wound back to the Starkfield road. Under the open sky the light was still clear, with a reflection of cold red on the eastern hills.
<p/>The clumps of trees in the snow seemed to draw together in ruffled lumps, like birds with their heads under their wings; and the sky, as it paled, rose higher, leaving the earth more alone.
<p/>As they turned into the Starkfield road Ethan said: <div class="bookquote">``Matt, what do you mean to do? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) did not answer at once, but at length she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I'll try to get a place in a store.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you can't do it. The bad air and the standing all day nearly killed you before. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I'm a lot stronger than I was before I came to Starkfield.''
<p/>'' And now you're going to throw away all the good it's done you!'' There seemed to be no answer to this, and again they drove on for a while without speaking.
<p/>With every yard of the way some spot where they had stood, and laughed together or been silent, clutched at Ethan and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) back.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't there any of your father's folks could help you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' There isn't any of 'em I'd ask. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice to say: <div class="bookquote">``You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you if I could.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know there isn't.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' But I can't-- '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was silent, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt a slight tremor in the shoulder against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>'' Oh, Matt,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) broke out, <div class="bookquote">``if I could ha' gone with you now I'd ha' done it-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>), pulling a scrap of paper from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) breast.
<p/>Even in the failing light he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) saw it was the letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) had begun the night before and forgotten to destroy.
<p/>'' Ethan--I found this,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stammered. Through his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) astonishment there ran a fierce thrill of joy. '' Matt--'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``if I could ha' done it, would you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh, Ethan, Ethan--what's the use? '' With a sudden movement she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tore the letter in shreds and sent them fluttering off into the snow.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was silent for a moment; then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, in such a low tone that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had to stoop his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) head to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>): ``I used to think of it sometimes, summer nights when the moon was so bright.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Matt! Tell me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) adjured her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). I couldn't sleep. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) heart reeled with the sweetness of it. ''
<p/>As long ago as that? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered, as if the date had long been fixed for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``The first time was at Shadow Pond.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>I was dreadfully put out when you wouldn't go to the picnic with me; and then, when I saw you coming down the road, I thought maybe you'd gone home that way
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was that why you gave me my coffee before the others?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Did I? o' purpose; and that made me glad.
<p/>They had reached the point where the road dipped to the hollow by Ethan's mill and as they descended the darkness descended with them, dropping down like a black veil from the heavy hemlock boughs.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They were silent again. '' I'm tied hand and foot, Matt. There isn't a thing I can do,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) began again.
<p/>'' You must write to me sometimes, Ethan.'' '' Oh, what good'll writing do? I want to put my hand out and touch you.
<p/>I want to do for you and care for you. I want to be there when you're sick and when you're lonesome.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't think but what I'll do all right.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You won't need me, you mean? I suppose you'll marry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, Ethan!
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cried. '' I don't know how it is you make me feel, Matt. I'd a`most rather have you dead than that!''
<p/>'' Oh, I wish I was, I wish I was! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sobbed. The sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) weeping shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) dark anger, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) felt ashamed.
<p/>'' Don't let's talk that way,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) whispered. '' Why shouldn't we, when it's true? I've been wishing it every minute of the day.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Matt! You be quiet! Don't you say it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div>'' There's never anybody been good to me but you. '' <div class="bookquote">``Don't say that either, when I can't lift a hand for you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes; but it's true just the same. '' They had reached the top of School House Hill and Starkfield lay below them in the twilight.
<p/>A cutter, mounting the road from the village, passed them by in a joyous flutter of bells, and they straightened themselves and looked ahead with rigid faces.
<p/>Along the main street lights had begun to shine from the house-fronts and stray figures were turning in here and there at the gates.
<p/>As they drew near the end of the village the cries of children reached them, and they saw a knot of boys, with sleds behind them, scattering across the open space before the church.
<p/>Ethan, with a touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) whip, roused the sorrel to a languid trot. '' I guess this'll be their last coast for a day or two,'' Ethan said, looking up at the mild sky.
<p/>Still she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) did not speak and, prompted by an obscure desire to help himself and her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) through their miserable last hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) went on discursively:
<p/>Mattie was silent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``We were to have gone down last night. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ain't it funny we haven't been down together but just that once last winter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They had reached the crest of the Corbury road, and between the indistinct white glimmer of the church and the black curtain of the Varnum spruces the slope stretched away below them without a sled on its length.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't often I got down to the village.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' That's so,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) said. Some erratic impulse prompted Ethan to say: <div class="bookquote">``How'd you like me to take you down now?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) forced a laugh. '' Why, there isn't time!'' '' There's all the time we want. Come along!'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) one desire now was to postpone the moment of turning the sorrel toward the Flats.
<p/>'' But the girl,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) faltered. '' The girl'll be waiting at the station.'' '' Well, let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wait. You'd have to if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't.
<p/>The note of authority in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) voice seemed to subdue her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) had jumped from the sleigh she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) help her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out, saying only, with a vague feint of reluctance:
<p/>Come!'' '' But there isn't a sled round anywheres.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, there is! Right over there under the spruces. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) threw the bearskin over the sorrel, who stood passively by the roadside, hanging a meditative head.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) caught Mattie's hand and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) after him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) toward the sled. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seated herself obediently and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) place behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), so close that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' All right, Matt? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) called out, as if the width of the road had been between them. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head to say: ``It's dreadfully dark.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) laughed contemptuously: <div class="bookquote">``I could go down this coast with my eyes tied!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) laughed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) audacity.
<p/>Nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) sat still a moment, straining his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) eyes down the long hill, for it was the most confusing hour of the evening,
<p/>the hour when the last clearness from the upper sky is merged with the rising night in a blur that disguises landmarks and falsifies distances.
<p/>The sled started with a bound, and they flew on through the dusk, gathering smoothness and speed as they went, with the hollow night opening out below them and the air singing by like an organ.
<p/>Mattie sat perfectly still, but as they reached the bend at the foot of the hill, where the big elm thrust out a deadly elbow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) shrank a little closer.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) cried exultantly, as they spun safely past it and flew down the second slope; and when they reached the level ground beyond, and the speed of the sled began to slacken, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) give a little laugh of glee.
<p/>Are you sure you can see?'' '' Now!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) cried. '' Don't be scared, Matt!'' They sprang off and started to walk back up the hill.
<p/>Ethan dragged the sled with one hand and passed the other through Mattie's arm. '' Were you scared I'd run you into the elm?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) asked with a boyish laugh. '' I told you I was never scared with you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) answered. The strange exaltation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) mood had brought on one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) rare fits of boastfulness.
<p/>'' It is a tricky place, though. The least swerve, and we'd never ha' come up again. But I can measure distances to a hair's-breadth--always could.
<p/>'' Deep silence had fallen with the starless dusk, and they leaned on each other without speaking; but at every step of their climb Ethan said to himself: <div class="bookquote">``It's the last time we'll ever walk together.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ethan/Frome/Ethan Frome</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) murmured: <div class="bookquote">``I always say you've got the surest eye... ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>They mounted slowly to the top of the hill.
<p/>When they were abreast of the church he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) stooped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) head to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) to ask: <div class="bookquote">``Are you tired?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) answered, breathing quickly: <div class="bookquote">``It was splendid!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With a pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) guided her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) toward the Norway spruces. '' I guess this sled must be Ned Hale's.
<p/>Anyhow I'll leave it where I found it. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) drew the sled up to the Varnum gate and rested it against the fence.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) raised himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) suddenly felt Mattie close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) among the shadows. '' Is this where Ned and Ruth kissed each other?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) whispered breathlessly, and flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) arms about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) lips, groping for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>), swept over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) fast in a rapture of surprise.
<p/>'' Good-bye-good-bye,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) stammered, and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) again. '' Oh, Matt, I can't let you go! '' broke from him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) in the same old cry.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) freed herself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) hold and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) sobbing. '' Oh, I can't go either!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) wailed. '' Matt!
<p/>What'll we do? What'll we do? '' They clung to each other's hands like children, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) body shook with desperate sobs.
<p/>Through the stillness they heard the church clock striking five. '' Oh, Ethan, it's time! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) cried. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>'' Time for what? You don't suppose I'm going to leave you now?'' '' If I missed my train where'd I go?
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Where are you going if you catch it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) stood silent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) hands lying cold and relaxed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>'' What's the good of either of us going anywheres without the other one now? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) remained motionless, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) had not heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) snatched her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) hands from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>), threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) arms about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) neck, and pressed a sudden drenched cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ethan! Ethan! I want you to take me down again!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Down where? '' <div class="bookquote">``The coast. Right off,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) panted. ''
<p/>So 't we'll never come up any more.'' <div class="bookquote">``Matt! What on earth do you mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) lips close against his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) ear to say:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right into the big elm. You said you could. So 't we'd never have to leave each other any more.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, what are you talking of?
<p/>You're crazy!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not crazy; but I will be if I leave you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Matt, Matt--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) groaned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) tightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) fierce hold about his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) neck.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) face lay close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) face. '' Ethan, where'll I go if I leave you? I don't know how to get along alone.
<p/>And there'll be that strange girl in the house... and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll sleep in my bed, where I used to lay nights and listen to hear you come up the stairs...
<p/>You said so yourself just now. Nobody but you was ever good to me. '' The words were like fragments torn from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) heart.
<p/>With them came the hated vision of the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) was going back to--of the stairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) would have to go up every night, of the woman who would wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) there.
<p/>And the sweetness of Mattie's avowal, the wild wonder of knowing at last that all that had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) too, made the other vision more abhorrent, the other life more intolerable to return to...
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pleadings still came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) between short sobs, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) no longer heard what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was saying. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hat had slipped back and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) was stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wanted to get the feeling of it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hand, so that it would sleep there like a seed in winter.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) cheek touched hers, and it was cold and full of weeping, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) saw the road to the Flats under the night and heard the whistle of the train up the line.
<p/>Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth again, and they seemed to be by the pond together in the burning August sun. The spruces swathed them in blackness and silence.
<p/>They might have been in their coffins underground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) said to himself: <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it'll feel like this...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and then again: <div class="bookquote">``After this I sha'n't feel anything...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) heard the old sorrel whinny across the road, and thought: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>)'s wondering why he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) doesn't get his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) supper...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) pulled the sled out, blinking like a night-bird as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) passed from the shade of the spruces into the transparent dusk of the open.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mattie/Mattie Silver</b></font>)</div>Mattie whispered, tugging at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hand. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) sombre violence constrained him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) seemed the embodied instrument of fate. The slope below them was deserted.
<p/>All Starkfield was at supper, and not a figure crossed the open space before the church. The sky, swollen with the clouds that announce a thaw, hung as low as before a summer storm.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) strained his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) eyes through the dimness, and they seemed less keen, less capable than usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) seat on the sled and Mattie instantly placed herself in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) legs, drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) heels into the road to keep the sled from slipping forward, and bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) head back between his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hat had fallen into the snow and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) lips were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hair. Then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) sprang up again. <div class="bookquote">``Get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/>It was the tone she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) always heeded, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) cowered down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) seat, repeating vehemently: <div class="bookquote">``No, no, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Get up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I want to sit in front.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no! How can you steer in front?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't have to. We'll follow the track.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They spoke in smothered whispers, as though the night were listening. <div class="bookquote">``Get up! Get up! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) kept on repeating: <div class="bookquote">``Why do you want to sit in front?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because I--because I want to feel you holding me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) stammered, and dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) feet. The answer seemed to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>), or else she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) yielded to the power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) voice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) bent down, feeling in the obscurity for the glassy slide worn by preceding coasters, and placed the runners carefully between its edges.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) waited while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) seated himself with crossed legs in the front of the sled; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) crouched quickly down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) back and clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) arms about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) breath in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) neck set him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) shuddering again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) almost sprang from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) seat. But in a flash he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) remembered the alternative.
<p/>Just as they started he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) heard the sorrel's whinny again, and the familiar wistful call, and all the confused images it brought with it, went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) down the first reach of the road.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) was right: this was better than parting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) leaned back and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) mouth to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>)... Half-way down there was a sudden drop, then a rise, and after that another long delirious descent.
<p/>As they took wing for this it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) that they were flying indeed, flying far up into the cloudy night, with Starkfield immeasurably below them, falling away like a speck in space...
<p/>Then the big elm shot up ahead, lying in wait for them at the bend of the road, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) said between his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) teeth: <div class="bookquote">``We can fetch it; I know we can fetch it--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As they flew toward the tree Mattie pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) arms tighter, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) blood seemed to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) veins.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) slanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) body to keep it headed for the elm, repeating to himself again and again: <div class="bookquote">``I know we can fetch it'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>; and little phrases she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had spoken ran through his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) head and danced before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) on the air.
<p/>The big tree loomed bigger and closer, and as they bore down on it he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) thought: <div class="bookquote">``It's waiting for us: it seems to know.
<p/>But suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wife's face, with twisted monstrous lineaments, thrust itself between him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) goal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) made an instinctive movement to brush it aside.
<p/>The sled swerved in response, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) righted it again, kept it straight, and drove down on the black projecting mass.
<p/>Once or twice the sled swerved a little under them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There was a last instant when the air shot past him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) like millions of fiery wires; and then the elm...
<p/>The sky was still thick, but looking straight up he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) saw a single star, and tried vaguely to reckon whether it were Sirius, or--or--The effort tired him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) too much, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) heavy lids and thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) would sleep...
<p/>The stillness was so profound that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) heard a little animal twittering somewhere near by under the snow. It made a small frightened cheep like a field mouse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) wondered languidly if it were hurt.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) understood that it must be in pain: pain so excruciating that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) seemed, mysteriously, to feel it shooting through his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) own body.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) tried in vain to roll over in the direction of the sound, and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) left arm out across the snow.
<p/>And now it was as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) felt rather than heard the twittering; it seemed to be under his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) palm, which rested on something soft and springy.
<p/>The thought of the animal's suffering was intolerable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) struggled to raise himself, and could not because a rock, or some huge mass, seemed to be lying on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) continued to finger about cautiously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) left hand, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) might get hold of the little creature and help it; and all at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) knew that the soft thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had touched was Mattie's hair and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hand was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) dragged himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) knees, the monstrous load on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) moving with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) moved, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hand went over and over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) felt that the twittering came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) lips...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) face down close to hers, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) ear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) mouth, and in the darkness he (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) eyes open and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) say his (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) name.
<p/>Oh, Matt, I thought we'd fetched it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) moaned; and far off, up the hill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) heard the sorrel whinny, and thought: <div class="bookquote">``I ought to be getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Matt</b></font>) feed...
<p/>**** THE QUERULOUS DRONE ceased as I entered Frome's kitchen, and of the two women sitting there I could not tell which had been the speaker.
<p/>One of them, on my appearing, raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) tall bony figure from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) seat, not as if to welcome me--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) threw me no more than a brief glance of surprise--but simply to set about preparing the meal which Frome's absence had delayed.
<p/>A slatternly calico wrapper hung from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) shoulders and the wisps of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) thin grey hair were drawn away from a high forehead and fastened at the back by a broken comb.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) had pale opaque eyes which revealed nothing and reflected nothing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) narrow lips were of the same sallow colour as her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) sat huddled in an arm-chair near the stove, and when I came in she (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) head quickly toward me, without the least corresponding movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) body.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) hair was as grey as her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) companion's, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) face as bloodless and shrivelled, but amber-tinted, with swarthy shadows sharpening the nose and hollowing the temples.
<p/>Under her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) shapeless dress her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) body kept its limp immobility, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mattie</b></font>) dark eyes had the bright witch-like stare that disease of the spine sometimes gives.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' * The other woman was much smaller and slighter. Even for that part of the country the kitchen was a poor-looking place.
<p/>With the exception of the dark-eyed woman's chair, which looked like a soiled relic of luxury bought at a country auction, the furniture was of the roughest kind.
<p/>Three coarse china plates and a broken-nosed milk-jug had been set on a greasy table scored with knife-cuts, and a couple of straw-bottomed chairs and a kitchen dresser of unpainted pine stood meagrely against the plaster walls.
<p/>'' My, it's cold here! The fire must be `most out,'' Frome said, glancing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) apologetically as he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) followed me in.
<p/>The tall woman, who had moved away from us toward the dresser, took no notice; but the other, from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cushioned niche, answered complainingly, in a high thin voice.
<p/>Zeena fell asleep and slep' ever so long, and I thought I'd be frozen stiff before I could wake her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up and get her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to `tend to it.
<p/>'' It's on'y just been made up this very minute. '' I knew then that it was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who had been speaking when we entered.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) companion, who was just coming back to the table with the remains of a cold mince-pie in a battered pie-dish, set down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) unappetising burden without appearing to hear the accusation brought against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Frome stood hesitatingly before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) advanced; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) looked at me and said: <div class="bookquote">``This is my wife, Mis' Frome.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>After another interval he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) added, turning toward the figure in the arm-chair: <div class="bookquote">``And this is Miss Mattie Silver... ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>*
<p/>**** Mrs. Hale, tender soul, had pictured me as lost in the Flats and buried under a snow-drift; and so lively was her (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) satisfaction on seeing me safely restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) the next morning that I felt my peril had caused me to advance several degrees in her (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) favour.
<p/>Great was her (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) amazement, and that of old Mrs. Varnum, on learning that Ethan Frome's old horse had carried me to and from Corbury Junction through the worst blizzard of the winter; greater still their surprise when they heard that his (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) master had taken me in for the night.
<p/>Beneath their wondering exclamations I felt a secret curiosity to know what impressions I had received from my night in the Frome household, and divined that the best way of breaking down their reserve was to let them try to penetrate mine.
<p/>I therefore confined myself to saying, in a matter-of-fact tone, that I had been received with great kindness, and that Frome had made a bed for me in a room on the ground-floor which seemed in happier days to have been fitted up as a kind of writing-room or study.
<p/>'' Well,'' Mrs. Hale mused, <div class="bookquote">``in such a storm I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Frome</b></font>) couldn't do less than take you in--
<p/>but I guess it went hard with Ethan. I don't believe but what you're the only stranger has set foot in that house for over twenty years.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)'s that proud he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) don't even like his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) oldest friends to go there; and I don't know as any do, any more, except myself and the doctor...
<p/>I used to go a good deal after the accident, when I was first married; but after awhile I got to think it made 'em feel worse to see us.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hale/Hale/Ned</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You still go there, Mrs. Hale? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ventured. '' And then one thing and another came, and my own troubles...
<p/>But I generally make out to drive over there round about New Year's, and once in the summer. Only I always try to pick a day when Ethan's off somewheres.
<p/>It's bad enough to see the two women sitting there--but his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) face, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) looks round that bare place, just kills me...
<p/>You see, I can look back and call it up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) mother's day, before their troubles.'' Old Mrs. Varnum, by this time, had gone up to bed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Varnum</b></font>) daughter
<p/>Mrs. Hale glanced at me tentatively, as though trying to see how much footing my conjectures gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>); and I guessed that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) had kept silence till now it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) had been waiting, through all the years, for some one who should see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) alone had seen.
<p/>I waited to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) trust in me gather strength before I said: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's pretty bad, seeing all three of them there together.
<p/>and I were sitting alone, after supper, in the austere seclusion of the horse-hair parlour. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) mild brows into a frown of pain.
<p/>'' It was just awful from the beginning. I was here in the house when they were carried up--they laid Mattie Silver in the room you're in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) and I were great friends, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) was to have been my bridesmaid in the spring... When she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) came to I went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) and stayed all night.
<p/>They gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) things to quiet her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) didn't know much till to`rd morning, and then all of a sudden she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) woke up just like herself, and looked straight at me out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) big eyes, and said...
<p/>Oh, I don't know why I'm telling you all this,'' Mrs. Hale broke off, crying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) spectacles, wiped the moisture from them, and put them on again with an unsteady hand.
<p/>It got about the next day,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that Zeena Frome had sent Mattie off in a hurry because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) had a hired girl coming, and the folks here could never rightly tell what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) and Ethan were doing that night coasting, when they'd ought to have been on their way to the Flats to ketch the train...
<p/>Anyhow, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) heard o' the accident she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) came right in and stayed with Ethan over to the minister's, where they'd carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>).
<p/>And as soon as the doctors said that Mattie could be moved, Zeena sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) back to the farm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I never knew myself what Zeena thought-- I don't to this day. Nobody knows Zeena's thoughts. '' And there she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>)'s been ever since?
<p/>Mrs. Hale answered simply: <div class="bookquote">``There was nowhere else for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) to go;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hale/Hale/Ned</b></font>)</div>and my heart tightened at the thought of the hard compulsions of the poor.
<p/>Yes, there she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>)'s been,'' Mrs. Hale continued, <div class="bookquote">``and Zeena's done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>), and done for Ethan, as good as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) could.
<p/>It was a miracle, considering how sick she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) was--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) seemed to be raised right up just when the call came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>).
<p/>Not as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>)'s ever given up doctoring, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>)'s had sick spells right along; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>)'s had the strength given her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) to care for those two for over twenty years, and before the accident came she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) couldn't even care for herself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hale/Hale/Ned</b></font>)</div>'' '' Mrs. Hale paused a moment, and I remained silent, plunged in the vision of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) words evoked.
<p/>'' It's horrible for them all,'' I murmured. '' Yes: it's pretty bad. And they ain't any of 'em easy people either.
<p/>Mattie was, before the accident; I never knew a sweeter nature. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>)'s suffered too much--that's what I always say when folks tell me how she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>)'s soured.
<p/>And Zeena, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) was always cranky. Not but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) bears with Mattie wonderful--I've seen that myself. But sometimes the two of them get going at each other, and then Ethan's face'd break your heart...
<p/>When I see that, I think it's him (<font color='blue'><b>Ethan</b></font>) that suffers most... anyhow it ain't Zeena, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) ain't got the time...
<p/>In the summertime, on pleasant days, they move Mattie into the parlour, or out in the door-yard, and that makes it easier...
<p/>It's a pity, though,'' Mrs. Hale ended, sighing, <div class="bookquote">``that they're all shut up there'n that one kitchen. but winters there's the fires to be thought of; and there ain't a dime to spare up at the Fromes.'
<p/>Mrs. Hale drew a deep breath, as though her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) memory were eased of its long burden, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) had no more to say; but suddenly an impulse of complete avowal seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hale/Hale/Ned</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) spectacles again, leaned toward me across the bead-work table-cover, and went on with lowered voice: ``There was one day, about a week after the accident, when they all thought Mattie couldn't live.
<p/>Well, I say it's a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) did. I said it right out to our minister once, and he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) was shocked at me.
<p/>Only he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) wasn't with me that morning when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>) first came to... And I say, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hale</b></font>)'d ha' died, Ethan might ha' lived; and
<p/>the way they are now, I don't see's there's much difference between the Fromes up at the farm and the Fromes down in the graveyard; `cept that down there they're all quiet, and the women have got to hold their tongues.
