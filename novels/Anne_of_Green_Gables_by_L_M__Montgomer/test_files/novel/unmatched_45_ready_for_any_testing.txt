mrs_rachel_lynde lived just where the avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow fringed with alders and lady eardrops and traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the wood of the old miss_marilla_cuthbert place it was reputed to be an intricate headlong brook in its earlier course through those wood with dark secrets of pool and cascade but by the time it reached mrs_rachel_lynde hollow
it was a quiet well conducted little stream for not even a brook could run past mrs_rachel_lynde door without due regard for decency and decorum it probably was conscious that mrs_rachel_lynde was sitting at her window keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed from brook and child up and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof
there are plenty of people in avonlea and out of it who can attend closely to their neighbor business by dint of neglecting their own but mrs_rachel_lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain
she was a notable housewife her work was always done and well done she ran the sewing circle helped run the sunday school and was the strongest prop of the church aid society and foreign missions auxiliary
yet with all this mrs_rachel_lynde found abundant time to sit for hour at her kitchen window knitting cotton warp quilts she had knitted sixteen of them as avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voice and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond
since avonlea occupied a little triangular peninsula jutting out into the gulf of st lawrence with water on two sides of it anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of mrs_rachel_lynde all seeing eye
the sun was coming in at the window warm and bright the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky white bloom hummed over by a myriad of bees
mrs_thomas mrs_rachel_lynde a meek little man whom avonlea people called mrs_rachel_lynde husband was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn and matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on the big red brook field away over by green gables
mrs_rachel_lynde knew that he ought because she had heard him tell mrs_peter_blewett morrison the evening before in william blair store over at carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon
mrs_peter_blewett had asked him of course for matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life
and yet here was matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert at half past three on the afternoon of a busy day placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill moreover he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes which was plain proof that he was going out of avonlea and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare which betokened that he was going a considerable distance
green gables chapter i mrs_rachel_lynde is surprised mrs she was sitting there one afternoon in early june now where was matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert going and why was he going there
had it been any other man in avonlea mrs_rachel_lynde deftly putting this and that together might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions
but matthew_cuthbert so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk
matthew_cuthbert dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy was something that didnt happen often mrs_rachel_lynde ponder as she might could make nothing of it and her afternoon enjoyment was spoiled
i ll just step over to green gables after tea and find out from miss_marilla_cuthbert where he gone and why the worthy woman finally concluded
he doesnt generally go to town this time of year and he never visits if he run out of turnip seed he wouldnt dress up and take the buggy to go for more he wasnt driving fast enough to be going for a doctor
i clean puzzled that what and i wont know a minute peace of mind or conscience until i know what has taken matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert out of avonlea today
accordingly after tea mrs_rachel_lynde set out she had not far to go the big rambling orchard embowered house where the cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from mrs_rachel_lynde hollow
yet something must have happened since last night to start him off to be sure the long lane made it a good deal further
matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert father as shy and silent as his son after him had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow man without actually retreating into the wood when he founded his homestead
green gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day barely visible from the main road along which all the other avonlea house were so sociably situated
it just staying that what she said as she stepped along the deep rutted grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes
mrs_rachel_lynde did not call living in such a place living at all it no wonder matthew_cuthbert and miss_marilla_cuthbert are both a little odd living away back here by themselves
tree arent much company though dear knows if they were there be enough of them i ruther look at people to be sure they seem contented enough but then i suppose they re used to it
a body can get used to anything even to being hanged as the irishman said with this mrs_rachel_lynde stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables
very green and neat and precise was that yard set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim lombardies
not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen for mrs_rachel_lynde would have seen it if there had been
privately she was of the opinion that miss_marilla_cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house one could have eaten a meal off the ground without over brimming the proverbial peck of dirt
the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor
its window looked east and west through the west one looking out on the back yard came a flood of mellow june sunlight but the east one whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry tree in the left orchard and nodding slender birches down in the hollow by the brook was greened over by a tangle of vines
here sat miss_marilla_cuthbert when she sat at all always slightly distrustful of sunshine which seemed to her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to be taken seriously and here she sat now knitting and the table behind her was laid for supper
mrs_rachel_lynde before she had fairly closed the door had taken a mental note of everything that was on that table
there were three plates laid so that miss_marilla_cuthbert must be expecting some one home with matthew_cuthbert to tea but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab apple preserves and one kind of cake so that the expected company could not be any particular company
mrs_rachel_lynde rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so yet what of matthew_cuthbert white collar and the sorrel mare
mrs_rachel_lynde was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet unmysterious green gables good evening mrs_rachel_lynde miss_marilla_cuthbert said briskly
something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between miss_marilla_cuthbert and mrs_rachel_lynde in spite of or
this is a real fine evening isnt it wont you sit down how are all your folks perhaps because of their dissimilarity
miss_marilla_cuthbert was a tall thin woman with angles and without curves her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it
she looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience which she was but there was a saving something about her mouth which if it had been ever so slightly developed might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor
we re all pretty well said mrs_rachel_lynde i was kind of afraid you werent though when i saw matthew_cuthbert starting off today
she had expected mrs_rachel_lynde up she had known that the sight of matthew_cuthbert jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor curiosity
i thought maybe he was going to the doctor miss_marilla_cuthbert lips twitched understandingly oh no i quite well although i had a bad headache yesterday she said
matthew_cuthbert went to bright river we re getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in nova scotia and he coming on the train tonight
if miss_marilla_cuthbert had said that matthew_cuthbert had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia mrs_rachel_lynde could not have been more astonished
she was actually stricken dumb for five seconds it was unsupposable that miss_marilla_cuthbert was making fun of her but mrs_rachel_lynde was almost forced to suppose it
yes of course said miss_marilla_cuthbert as if getting boy from orphan asylum in nova scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well regulated avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation
are you in earnest miss_marilla_cuthbert she demanded when voice returned to her mrs_rachel_lynde felt that she had received a severe mental jolt
she thought in exclamation points a boy miss_marilla_cuthbert and matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum
well the world was certainly turning upside down she would be surprised at nothing after this nothing what on earth put such a notion into your head
she demanded disapprovingly this had been done without her advice being asked and must perforce be disapproved well we ve been thinking about it for some time all winter in fact returned miss_marilla_cuthbert
mrs_alexander_spencer was up here one day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hopeton in the spring
her cousin life there and mrs_alexander_spencer has visited here and knows all about it so matthew_cuthbert and i have talked it over off and on ever since
we thought we get a boy matthew_cuthbert is getting up in year you know he sixty and he isnt so spry as he once was
his heart trouble him a good deal and you know how desperate hard it got to be to get hired help
there never anybody to be had but those stupid half grown little french boy and as soon as you do get one broke into your way and taught something he up and off to the lobster canneries or the states
at first matthew_cuthbert suggested getting a home boy but i said no flat to that they may be all right
i not saying they re not but no london street arabs for me i said give me a native born at least
there ll be a risk no matter who we get but i ll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at night if we get a born canadian
so in the end we decided to ask mrs_alexander_spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl
we heard last week she was going so we sent her word by richard mrs_alexander_spencer folks at carmody to bring us a smart likely boy of about ten or eleven
we decided that would be the best age old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper
we had a telegram from mrs_alexander_spencer today the mail man brought it from the station saying they were coming on the five thirty train tonight
we mean to give him a good home and schooling so matthew_cuthbert went to bright river to meet him mrs_alexander_spencer will drop him off there
mrs_rachel_lynde prided herself on always speaking her mind she proceeded to speak it now having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news
of course she goes on to white sands station herself well miss_marilla_cuthbert i ll just tell you plain that i think you re doing a mighty foolish thing a risky thing that what
you re bringing a strange child into your house and home and you dont know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had nor how he likely to turn out
why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the island took a boy out of an orphan asylum
and he set fire to the house at night set it on purpose miss_marilla_cuthbert and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their bed
you dont know what you re getting and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs they couldnt break him of it
if you had asked my advice in the matter which you didnt do miss_marilla_cuthbert i have said for mercy sake not to think of such a thing that what
this job comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm miss_marilla_cuthbert she knitted steadily on i dont deny there something in what you say mrs_rachel_lynde
i ve had some qualms myself but matthew_cuthbert was terrible set on it i could see that so i gave in it so seldom
matthew_cuthbert sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel it my duty to give in and as for the risk there risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world
there risks in people having child of their own if it comes to that they dont always turn out well and then nova scotia is right close to the island
it isnt as if we were getting him from england or the states he cant be much different from ourselves
well i hope it will turn out all right said mrs_rachel_lynde in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts
only dont say i didnt warn you if he burns green gables down or puts strychnine in the well i heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies
well we re not getting a girl said miss_marilla_cuthbert as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy
only it was a girl in that instance i never dream of taking a girl to bring up
i wonder at mrs_alexander_spencer for doing it but there she wouldnt shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head
but reflecting that it would be a good two hour at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to robert mr_william_bell and tell the news
mrs_rachel_lynde would have liked to stay until matthew_cuthbert came home with his imported orphan it would certainly make a sensation second to none and mrs_rachel_lynde dearly loved to make a sensation
so she took herself away somewhat to miss_marilla_cuthbert relief for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of mrs_rachel_lynde pessimism
well of all thing that ever were or will be ejaculated mrs_rachel_lynde when she was safely out in the lane
it does really seem as if i must be dreaming well i sorry for that poor young one and no mistake
matthew_cuthbert and miss_marilla_cuthbert dont know anything about child and they ll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather if so be he ever had a grandfather which is doubtful
it seems uncanny to think of a child at green gables somehow there never been one there for matthew_cuthbert and miss_marilla_cuthbert were grown up when the new house was built if they ever were child which is hard to believe when one look at them
so said mrs_rachel_lynde to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her heart but if she could have seen the child who was waiting patiently at the bright river station at that very moment her pity would have been still deeper and more profound
i wouldnt be in that orphan shoes for anything my but i pity him that what chapter ii matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert is surprised matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to bright river
it was a pretty road running along between snug farmsteads with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom
the air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple while the little birds sang as if it were the one day of summer in all the year
matthew_cuthbert enjoyed the drive after his own fashion except during the moment when he met woman and had to nod to them for in prince edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not
matthew_cuthbert dreaded all woman except miss_marilla_cuthbert and mrs_rachel_lynde he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him
he may have been quite right in thinking so for he was an odd looking personage with an ungainly figure and long iron gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty
in fact he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty lacking a little of the grayness
when he reached bright river there was no sign of any train he thought he was too early so he tied his horse in the yard of the small bright river hotel and went over to the station house
the long platform was almost deserted the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end
matthew_cuthbert barely noting that it was a girl sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression
she was sitting there waiting for something or somebody and since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then she sat and waited with all her might and main
matthew_cuthbert encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper and asked him if the five thirty train would soon be along
the five thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago answered that brisk official but there was a passenger dropped off for you a little girl
i asked her to go into the lady waiting room but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside
she sitting out there on the shingles there was more scope for imagination she said she a case i should say
i not expecting a girl said matthew_cuthbert blankly it a boy i ve come for he should be here
mrs_alexander_spencer was to bring him over from nova scotia for me the stationmaster whistled guess there some mistake he said
said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently
mrs_alexander_spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge that all i know about it and i havent got any more orphan concealed hereabouts
i dont understand said matthew_cuthbert helplessly wishing that miss_marilla_cuthbert was at hand to cope with the situation well you better question the girl said the station master carelessly
i dare say she ll be able to explain she got a tongue of her own that certain maybe they were out of boy of the brand you wanted
he walked jauntily away being hungry and the unfortunate matthew_cuthbert was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den walk up to a girl a strange girl an orphan girl and demand of her why she wasnt a boy
matthew_cuthbert groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her she had been watching him ever since he had passed her
matthew_cuthbert was not looking at her and would not have seen what she was really like if he had been but an ordinary observer would have seen this a child of about eleven garbed in a very short very tight very ugly dress of yellowish gray wincey
she wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat extending down her back were two braids of very thick decidedly red hair
her face was small white and thin also much freckled her mouth was large and so were her eye which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others
so far the ordinary observer an extraordinary observer might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced that the big eye were full of spirit and vivacity that the mouth was sweet lipped and expressive that the forehead was broad and full in short our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded that no commonplace soul inhabited the body of this stray woman child of whom shy matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert was so ludicrously afraid
matthew_cuthbert however was spared the ordeal of speaking first for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her
she stood up grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby old fashioned carpet bag the other she held out to him
and she had her eye on him now i suppose you are mr matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert of green gables she said in a peculiarly clear sweet voice
i very glad to see you i was beginning to be afraid you werent coming for me and i was imagining all the thing that might have happened to prevent you
i had made up my mind that if you didnt come for me to night i go down the track to that big wild cherry tree at the bend and climb up into it to stay all night
i wouldnt be a bit afraid and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry tree all white with bloom in the moonshine dont you think
you could imagine you were dwelling in marble hall couldnt you and i was quite sure you would come for me in the morning if you didnt to night
he could not tell this child with the glowing eye that there had been a mistake he would take her home and let miss_marilla_cuthbert do that
she couldnt be left at bright river anyhow no matter what mistake had been made so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at green gables
matthew_cuthbert had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his then and there he decided what to do i sorry i was late he said shyly
come along the horse is over in the yard give me your bag oh i can carry it the child responded cheerfully
and if it isnt carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out so i better keep it because i know the exact knack of it
it isnt heavy i ve got all my worldly goods in it but it isnt heavy it an extremely old carpet bag
oh i very glad you ve come even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry tree we ve got to drive a long piece havent we
mrs_alexander_spencer said it was eight miles i glad because i love driving oh it seems so wonderful that i going to live with you and belong to you
i ve never belonged to anybody not really but the asylum was the worst i ve only been in it four months but that was enough
i dont suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum so you cant possibly understand what it is like it worse than anything you could imagine
mrs_alexander_spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that but i didnt mean to be wicked it so easy to be wicked without knowing it isnt it
they were good you know the asylum people but there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum only just in the other orphan
it was pretty interesting to imagine thing about them to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really the daughter of a belted earl who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess
i used to lie awake at night and imagine thing like that because i didnt have time in the day i guess that why i so thin
i am dreadful thin aint i there isnt a pick on my bones i do love to imagine i nice and plump with dimples in my elbows
with this matthew_cuthbert companion stopped talking partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy
not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks fringed with blooming wild cherry tree and slim white birches were several feet above their head
the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy
isnt that beautiful what did that tree leaning out from the bank all white and lacy make you think of
she asked well now i dunno said matthew_cuthbert why a bride of course a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil
i ve never seen one but i can imagine what she would look like i dont ever expect to be a bride myself
i so homely nobody will ever want to marry me unless it might be a foreign missionary i suppose a foreign missionary mightnt be very particular
but i do hope that some day i shall have a white dress that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss
i just love pretty clothes and i ve never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember but of course it all the more to look forward to isnt it
this morning when i left the asylum i felt so ashamed because i had to wear this horrid old wincey dress
and then i can imagine that i dressed gorgeously all the orphan had to wear them you know a merchant in hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum
some people said it was because he couldnt sell it but i rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart wouldnt you
but i just went to work and imagined that i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worth while and a big hat all flower and nodding plumes and a gold watch and kid gloves and boots
when we got on the train i felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me i felt cheered up right away
and i enjoyed my trip to the island with all my might i wasnt a bit sick coming over in the boat
neither was mrs_alexander_spencer although she generally is she said she hadnt time to get sick watching to see that i didnt fall overboard
she said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about but if it kept her from being seasick it a mercy i did prowl isnt it
and i wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat because i didnt know whether i ever have another opportunity
oh there are a lot more cherry tree all in bloom this island is the bloomiest place i just love it already and i so glad i going to live here
i ve always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world and i used to imagine i was living here but i never really expected i would
when we got into the train at charlottetown and the red road began to flash past i asked mrs_alexander_spencer what made them red
it delightful when your imagination come true isnt it but those red road are so funny and she said she didnt know
and for pity sake not to ask her any more questions she said i must have asked her a thousand already
i suppose i had too but how you going to find out about thing if you dont ask questions and what does make the road red
well now i dunno said matthew_cuthbert well that is one of the thing to find out sometime isnt it splendid to think of all the thing there are to find out about
it just makes me feel glad to be alive it such an interesting world it wouldnt be half so interesting if we know all about everything would it
there be no scope for imagination then would there but am i talking too much people are always telling me i do
would you rather i didnt talk if you say so i ll stop i can stop when i make up my mind to it although it difficult
like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it
matthew_cuthbert much to his own surprise was enjoying himself but he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl
he detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly with sidewise glances as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word
woman were bad enough in all conscience but little girl were worse that was the avonlea type of well bred little girl
but this freckled witch was very different and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes he thought that he kind of liked her chatter
so he said as shyly as usual oh you can talk as much as you like i dont mind
it such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told that child should be seen and not heard
oh i so glad i know you and i are going to get along together fine i ve had that said to me a million time if i have once
and people laugh at me because i use big word but if you have big ideas you have to use big word to express them havent you
well now that seems reasonable said matthew_cuthbert mrs_alexander_spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle but it isnt
it firmly fastened at one end mrs_alexander_spencer said your place was named green gables i asked her all about it
and there werent any at all about the asylum only a few poor weeny teeny thing out in front with little whitewashed cagey thing about them
and she said there were tree all around it i was gladder than ever i just love tree they just looked like orphan themselves those tree did
it used to make me want to cry to look at them i used to say to them oh you poor little thing
if you were out in a great big wood with other tree all around you and little mosses and june bells growing over your roots and a brook not far away and birds singing in you branches you could grow couldnt you
but you cant where you are i know just exactly how you feel little tree i felt sorry to leave them behind this morning
you do get so attached to thing like that dont you is there a brook anywhere near green gables i forgot to ask mrs_alexander_spencer that
well now yes there one right below the house fancy it always been one of my dream to live near a brook
i never expected i would though dream dont often come true do they wouldnt it be nice if they did but just now i feel pretty nearly perfectly happy
i cant feel exactly perfectly happy because well what color would you call this she twitched one of her long glossy braids over her thin shoulder and held it up before matthew_cuthbert eye
matthew_cuthbert was not used to deciding on the tints of lady tresses but in this case there couldnt be much doubt
the girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from her very toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages
it red aint it he said yes it red she said resignedly now you see why i cant be perfectly happy
nobody could who has red hair i dont mind the other thing so much the freckles and the green eye and my skinniness
i can imagine them away i can imagine that i have a beautiful rose leaf complexion and lovely starry violet eye but i cannot imagine that red hair away
i do my best i think to myself now my hair is a glorious black black as the raven wing but all the time i know it is just plain red and it breaks my heart
it will be my lifelong sorrow i read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasnt red hair
her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster brow what is an alabaster brow i never could find out
he felt as he had once felt in his rash youth when another boy had enticed him on the merry go round at a picnic
can you tell me well now i afraid i cant said matthew_cuthbert who was getting a little dizzy well whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was divinely beautiful
have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be divinely beautiful well now no i havent confessed matthew_cuthbert ingenuously
i have often which would you rather be if you had the choice divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good
well now i i dont know exactly neither do i i can never decide but it doesnt make much real difference for it isnt likely i ll ever be either
that was not what mrs_alexander_spencer had said neither had the child tumbled out of the buggy nor had matthew_cuthbert done anything astonishing
it certain i ll never be angelically good mrs_alexander_spencer says oh mr miss_marilla_cuthbert oh mr miss_marilla_cuthbert oh mr miss_marilla_cuthbert they had simply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the avenue
the avenue so called by the newbridge people was a stretch of road four or five hundred yards long completely arched over with huge wide spreading apple tree planted year ago by an eccentric old farmer
below the boughs the air was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse of painted sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a cathedral aisle
she leaned back in the buggy her thin hand clasped before her her face lifted rapturously to the white splendor above
overhead was one long canopy of snowy fragrant bloom its beauty seemed to strike the child dumb even when they had passed out and were driving down the long slope to newbridge she never moved or spoke
still with rapt face she gazed afar into the sunset west with eye that saw visions trooping splendidly across that glowing background
through newbridge a bustling little village where dogs barked at them and small boy hooted and curious face peered from the window they drove still in silence
when three more miles had dropped away behind them the child had not spoken she could keep silence it was evident as energetically as she could talk
i guess you re feeling pretty tired and hungry matthew_cuthbert ventured to say at last accounting for her long visitation of dumbness with the only reason he could think of
she came out of her reverie with a deep sigh and looked at him with the dreamy gaze of a soul that had been wondering afar star led
but we havent very far to go now only another mile oh mr miss_marilla_cuthbert she whispered that place we came through that white place what was it
well now you must mean the avenue said matthew_cuthbert after a few moment profound reflection it is a kind of pretty place
pretty oh pretty doesnt seem the right word to use nor beautiful either they dont go far enough oh it was wonderful wonderful
it the first thing i ever saw that couldnt be improved upon by imagination it just satisfies me here she put one hand on her breast it
made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache did you ever have an ache like that mr miss_marilla_cuthbert
well now i just cant recollect that i ever had i have it lot of time whenever i see anything royally beautiful
but they shouldnt call that lovely place the avenue there is no meaning in a name like that they should call it let me see the white way of delight
isnt that a nice imaginative name when i dont like the name of a place or a person i always imagine a new one and always think of them
so there was a girl at the asylum whose name was hepzibah jenkins but i always imagined her as rosalia devere
other people may call that place the avenue but i shall always call it the white way of delight have we really only another mile to go before we get home
i glad and i sorry i sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and i always sorry when pleasant thing end
something still pleasanter may come after but you can never be sure and it so often the case that it isnt pleasanter
that has been my experience anyhow but i glad to think of getting home you see i ve never had a real home since i can remember
it gives me that pleasant ache again just to think of coming to a really truly home oh isnt that pretty
they had driven over the crest of a hill below them was a pond looking almost like a river so long and winding was it
a bridge spanned it midway and from there to its lower end where an amber hued belt of sand hill shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond the water was a glory of many shifting hues the most spiritual shadings of crocus and rose and ethereal green with other elusive tintings for which no name has ever been found
above the bridge the pond ran up into fringing groves of fir and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering shadows
here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a white clad girl tip toeing to her own reflection from the marsh at the head of the pond came the clear mournfully sweet chorus of the frogs
there was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on a slope beyond and although it was not yet quite dark a light was shining from one of its window
that diana_barry pond said matthew_cuthbert oh i dont like that name either i shall call it let me see the lake of shining waters
yes that is the right name for it i know because of the thrill when i hit on a name that suits exactly it gives me a thrill
it always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly white grubs that spade up in the cucumber bed
do thing ever give you a thrill matthew_cuthbert ruminated well now yes i hate the look of them oh i dont think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill
do you think it can there doesnt seem to be much connection between grubs and lakes of shining waters does there
but why do other people call it diana_barry pond i reckon because mr diana_barry life up there in that house orchard slope the name of his place
if it wasnt for that big bush behind it you could see green gables from here but we have to go over the bridge and round by the road so
it near half a mile further has mr diana_barry any little girl well not so very little either about my size
he got one about eleven her name is diana_barry oh with a long indrawing of breath what a perfectly lovely name
well now i dunno there something dreadful heathenish about it seems to me i ruther jane_andrews or mary or some sensible name like that
but when diana_barry was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they gave him the naming of her and he called her diana_barry
i wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when i was born then oh here we are at the bridge
i cant help imagining that perhaps just as we get to the middle they ll crumple up like a jack knife and nip us
i going to shut my eye tight i always afraid going over bridge so i shut my eye but i always have to open them for all when i think we re getting near the middle
because you see if the bridge did crumple up i want to see it crumple what a jolly rumble it makes
i always like the rumble part of it isnt it splendid there are so many thing to like in this world
there we re over now i ll look back good night dear lake of shining waters i always say good night to the thing i love just as i would to people
i think they like it that water look as if it was smiling at me when they had driven up the further hill and around a corner
oh dont tell me she interrupted breathlessly catching at his partially raised arm and shutting her eye that she might not see his gesture
matthew_cuthbert said we re pretty near home now that green gables over let me guess i sure i ll guess right she opened her eye and looked about her
they were on the crest of a hill the sun had set some time since but the landscape was still clear in the mellow afterlight
to the west a dark church spire rose up against a marigold sky below was a little valley and beyond a long gently rising slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it
at last they lingered on one away to the left far back from the road dimly white with blossoming tree in the twilight of the surrounding wood
from one to another the child eye darted eager and wistful over it in the stainless southwest sky a great crystal white star was shining like a lamp of guidance and promise
that it isnt it she said pointing matthew_cuthbert slapped the reins on the sorrel back delightedly well now you ve guessed it
but i reckon mrs_alexander_spencer described it so you could tell no she didnt really she didnt all she said might just as well have been about most of those other place
i hadnt any real idea what it looked like but just as soon as i saw it i felt it was home
do you know my arm must be black and blue from the elbow up for i ve pinched myself so many time today
oh it seems as if i must be in a dream every little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me
then i pinch myself to see if it was real until suddenly i remembered that even supposing it was only a dream
and i be so afraid it was all a dream i better go on dreaming as long as i could so i stopped pinching
but it is real and we re nearly home with a sigh of rapture she relapsed into silence matthew_cuthbert stirred uneasily
he felt glad that it would be miss_marilla_cuthbert and not he who would have to tell this waif of the world that the home she longed for was not to be hers after all
they drove over mrs_rachel_lynde hollow where it was already quite dark but not so dark that mrs_rachel_lynde could not see them from her window vantage and up the hill and into the long lane of green gables
by the time they arrived at the house matthew_cuthbert was shrinking from the approaching revelation with an energy he did not understand
it was not of miss_marilla_cuthbert or himself he was thinking of the trouble this mistake was probably going to make for them but of the child disappointment
when he thought of that rapt light being quenched in her eye he had an uncomfortable feeling that he was going to assist at murdering something much the same feeling that came over him when he had to kill a lamb or calf or any other innocent little creature
the yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves were rustling silkily all round it
listen to the tree talking in their sleep she whispered as he lifted her to the ground what nice dream they must have
then holding tightly to the carpet bag which contained all her worldly goods she followed him into the house chapter iii miss_marilla_cuthbert is surprised miss_marilla_cuthbert came briskly forward as matthew_cuthbert opened the door
but when her eye fell on the odd little figure in the stiff ugly dress with the long braids of red hair and the eager luminous eye she stopped short in amazement
matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert who that she ejaculated where is the boy there wasnt any boy said matthew_cuthbert wretchedly
there was only her he nodded at the child remembering that he had never even asked her name
no boy but there must have been a boy insisted miss_marilla_cuthbert we sent word to mrs_alexander_spencer to bring a boy
well she didnt she brought her i asked the station master and i had to bring her home she couldnt be left there no matter where the mistake had come in
during this dialogue the child had remained silent her eye roving from one to the other all the animation fading out of her face
well this is a pretty piece of business ejaculated miss_marilla_cuthbert suddenly she seemed to grasp the full meaning of what had been said
dropping her precious carpet bag she sprang forward a step and clasped her hand you dont want me she cried
you dont want me because i not a boy i might have expected it nobody ever did want me i might have known it was all too beautiful to last
i might have known nobody really did want me oh what shall i do i going to burst into tear burst into tear she did
sitting down on a chair by the table flinging her arms out upon it and burying her face in them she proceeded to cry stormily
miss_marilla_cuthbert and matthew_cuthbert looked at each other deprecatingly across the stove neither of them knew what to say or do finally miss_marilla_cuthbert stepped lamely into the breach
well well there no need to cry so about it yes there is need the child raised her head quickly revealing a tear stained face and trembling lips
you would cry too if you were an orphan and had come to a place you thought was going to be home and found that they didnt want you because you werent a boy
oh this is the most tragical thing that ever happened to me something like a reluctant smile rather rusty from long disuse mellowed miss_marilla_cuthbert grim expression
well dont cry any more we re not going to turn you out of door to night you ll have to stay here until we investigate this affair
what your name the child hesitated for a moment will you please call me lady_cordelia_fitzgerald she said eagerly
call you lady_cordelia_fitzgerald is that your name no o it not exactly my name but i would love to be called lady_cordelia_fitzgerald
it such a perfectly elegant name i dont know what on earth you mean if lady_cordelia_fitzgerald isnt your name what is
it cant matter much to you what you call me if i only going to be here a little while can it
anne_shirley reluctantly faltered forth the owner of that name but oh please do call me lady_cordelia_fitzgerald and anne_shirley is such an unromantic name
unromantic fiddlesticks said the unsympathetic miss_marilla_cuthbert anne_shirley is a real good plain sensible name you ve no need to be ashamed of it
oh i not ashamed of it explained anne_shirley only i like lady_cordelia_fitzgerald better i ve always imagined that my name was lady_cordelia_fitzgerald
at least i always have of late year when i was young i used to imagine it was geraldine but i like lady_cordelia_fitzgerald better now
but if you call me anne_shirley please call me anne_shirley spelled with an what difference does it make how it spelled asked miss_marilla_cuthbert with another rusty smile as she picked up the teapot
when you hear a name pronounced cant you always see it in your mind just as if it was printed out
oh it makes such a difference it look so much nicer i can and a n look dreadful but a n look so much more distinguished
if you ll only call me anne_shirley spelled with an i shall try to reconcile myself to not being called lady_cordelia_fitzgerald
very well then anne_shirley spelled with an can you tell us how this mistake came to be made we sent word to mrs_alexander_spencer to bring us a boy
were there no boy at the asylum oh yes there was an abundance of them but mrs_alexander_spencer said distinctly that you wanted a girl about eleven year old
and the matron said she thought i would do you dont know how delighted i was i couldnt sleep all last night for joy
oh she added reproachfully turning to matthew_cuthbert why didnt you tell me at the station that you didnt want me and leave me there
if i hadnt seen the white way of delight and the lake of shining waters it wouldnt be so hard
what on earth does she mean demanded miss_marilla_cuthbert staring at matthew_cuthbert she she just referring to some conversation we had on the road said matthew_cuthbert hastily
i going out to put the mare in miss_marilla_cuthbert have tea ready when i come back did mrs_alexander_spencer bring anybody over besides you
continued miss_marilla_cuthbert when matthew_cuthbert had gone out she brought lily jones for herself lily is only five year old and she is very beautiful and had nut brown hair
if i was very beautiful and had nut brown hair would you keep me no we want a boy to help matthew_cuthbert on the farm
a girl would be of no use to us take off your hat i ll lay it and your bag on the hall table
anne_shirley took off her hat meekly matthew_cuthbert came back presently and they sat down to supper but anne_shirley could not eat
in vain she nibbled at the bread and butter and pecked at the crab apple preserve out of the little scalloped glass dish by her plate
she did not really make any headway at all you re not eating anything said miss_marilla_cuthbert sharply eying her as if it were a serious shortcoming
anne_shirley sighed i cant i in the depths of despair can you eat when you are in the depths of despair
i ve never been in the depths of despair so i cant say responded miss_marilla_cuthbert werent you well did you ever try to imagine you were in the depths of despair
no i didnt then i dont think you can understand what it like it a very uncomfortable feeling indeed
when you try to eat a lump comes right up in your throat and you cant swallow anything not even if it was a chocolate caramel
i ve often dreamed since then that i had a lot of chocolate caramels but i always wake up just when i going to eat them
i had one chocolate caramel once two year ago and it was simply delicious i do hope you wont be offended because i cant eat
everything is extremely nice but still i cannot eat i guess she tired said matthew_cuthbert who hadnt spoken since his return from the barn
best put her to bed miss_marilla_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert had been wondering where anne_shirley should be put to bed she had prepared a couch in the kitchen chamber for the desired and expected boy
but the spare room was out of the question for such a stray waif so there remained only the east gable room
miss_marilla_cuthbert lighted a candle and told anne_shirley to follow her which anne_shirley spiritlessly did taking her hat and carpet bag from the hall table as she passed
but although it was neat and clean it did not seem quite the thing to put a girl there somehow the hall was fearsomely clean the little gable chamber in which she presently found herself seemed still cleaner
miss_marilla_cuthbert set the candle on a three legged three cornered table and turned down the bedclothes i suppose you have a nightgown
she questioned anne_shirley nodded yes i have two the matron of the asylum made them for me they re fearfully skimpy
there is never enough to go around in an asylum so thing are always skimpy at least in a poor asylum like ours
but one can dream just as well in them as in lovely trailing one with frills around the neck that one consolation
i hate skimpy night dress well undress as quick as you can and go to bed i ll come back in a few minute for the candle
i darent trust you to put it out yourself you likely set the place on fire when miss_marilla_cuthbert had gone anne_shirley looked around her wistfully
the floor was bare too except for a round braided mat in the middle such as anne_shirley had never seen before
the whitewashed walls were so painfully bare and staring that she thought they must ache over their own bareness in one corner was the bed a high old fashioned one with four dark low turned posts
in the other corner was the aforesaid three corner table adorned with a fat red velvet pin cushion hard enough to turn the point of the most adventurous pin
midway between table and bed was the window with an icy white muslin frill over it and opposite it was the wash stand
the whole apartment was of a rigidity not to be described in word but which sent a shiver to the very marrow of anne_shirley bones
with a sob she hastily discarded her garments put on the skimpy nightgown and sprang into bed where she burrowed face downward into the pillow and pulled the clothes over her head
when miss_marilla_cuthbert came up for the light various skimpy articles of raiment scattered most untidily over the floor and a certain tempestuous appearance of the bed were the only indications of any presence save her own
she deliberately picked up anne_shirley clothes placed them neatly on a prim yellow chair and then taking up the candle went over to the bed
above it hung a little six by eight mirror good night she said a little awkwardly but not unkindly anne_shirley white face and big eye appeared over the bedclothes with a startling suddenness
how can you call it a good night when you know it must be the very worst night i ve ever had
she said reproachfully then she dived down into invisibility again miss_marilla_cuthbert went slowly down to the kitchen and proceeded to wash the supper dishes
he seldom smoked for miss_marilla_cuthbert set her face against it as a filthy habit but at certain time and seasons he felt driven to it and them miss_marilla_cuthbert winked at the practice realizing that a mere man must have some vent for his emotions
matthew_cuthbert was smoking a sure sign of perturbation of mind well this is a pretty kettle of fish she said wrathfully
this is what comes of sending word instead of going ourselves richard mrs_alexander_spencer folks have twisted that message somehow one of us will have to drive over and see mrs_alexander_spencer tomorrow that certain
this girl will have to be sent back to the asylum yes i suppose so said matthew_cuthbert reluctantly you suppose so
dont you know it well now she a real nice little thing miss_marilla_cuthbert it kind of a pity to send her back when she so set on staying here
matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert you dont mean to say you think we ought to keep her miss_marilla_cuthbert astonishment could not have been greater if matthew_cuthbert had expressed a predilection for standing on his head
well now no i suppose not not exactly stammered matthew_cuthbert uncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning i suppose we could hardly be expected to keep her
i should say not what good would she be to us we might be some good to her said matthew_cuthbert suddenly and unexpectedly
matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert i believe that child has bewitched you i can see as plain as plain that you want to keep her
well now she a real interesting little thing persisted matthew_cuthbert you should have heard her talk coming from the station
oh she can talk fast enough i saw that at once it nothing in her favour either i dont like child who have so much to say
i dont want an orphan girl and if i did she isnt the style i pick out there something i dont understand about her
no she got to be despatched straight way back to where she came from i could hire a french boy to help me said matthew_cuthbert and she be company for you
i not suffering for company said miss_marilla_cuthbert shortly and i not going to keep her well now it just as you say of course miss_marilla_cuthbert said matthew_cuthbert rising and putting his pipe away
i going to bed to bed went matthew_cuthbert and to bed when she had put her dishes away went miss_marilla_cuthbert frowning most resolutely
morning at green gables it was broad daylight when anne_shirley awoke and sat up in bed staring confusedly at the window through which a flood of cheery sunshine was pouring and outside of which something white and feathery waved across glimpses of blue sky
and up stairs in the east gable a lonely heart hungry friendless child cried herself to sleep chapter iv for a moment she could not remember where she was
first came a delightful thrill as something very pleasant then a horrible remembrance this was green gables and they didnt want her because she wasnt a boy
but it was morning and yes it was a cherry tree in full bloom outside of her window with a bound she was out of bed and across the floor
she pushed up the sash it went up stiffly and creakily as if it hadnt been opened for a long time which was the case and it stuck so tight that nothing was needed to hold it up
anne_shirley dropped on her knees and gazed out into the june morning her eye glistening with delight oh wasnt it beautiful
wasnt it a lovely place suppose she wasnt really going to stay here she would imagine she was there was scope for imagination here
a huge cherry tree grew outside so close that its boughs tapped against the house and it was so thick set with blossoms that hardly a leaf was to be seen
on both sides of the house was a big orchard one of apple tree and one of cherry tree also showered over with blossoms and their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions
in the garden below were lilac tree purple with flower and their dizzily sweet fragrance drifted up to the window on the morning wind
below the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the hollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew upspringing airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful possibilities in ferns and mosses and woodsy thing generally
beyond it was a hill green and feathery with spruce and fir there was a gap in it where the gray gable end of the little house she had seen from the other side of the lake of shining waters was visible
off to the left were the big barns and beyond them away down over green low sloping field was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea
she had looked on so many unlovely place in her life poor child but this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed
she knelt there lost to everything but the loveliness around her until she was startled by a hand on her shoulder
anne_shirley beauty loving eye lingered on it all taking everything greedily in miss_marilla_cuthbert had come in unheard by the small dreamer
miss_marilla_cuthbert really did not know how to talk to the child and her uncomfortable ignorance made her crisp and curt when she did not mean to be
it time you were dressed she said curtly anne_shirley stood up and drew a long breath oh isnt it wonderful
she said waving her hand comprehensively at the good world outside it a big tree said miss_marilla_cuthbert and it blooms great but the fruit dont amount to much never small and wormy
yes it radiantly lovely it blooms as if it meant it but i meant everything the garden and the orchard and the brook and the wood the whole big dear world
oh i dont mean just the tree of course it lovely dont you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning like this
and i can hear the brook laughing all the way up here have you ever noticed what cheerful thing brook are
they re always laughing even in winter time i ve heard them under the ice i so glad there a brook near green gables
i shall always like to remember that there is a brook at green gables even if i never see it again
perhaps you think it doesnt make any difference to me when you re not going to keep me but it does if there wasnt a brook i be haunted by the uncomfortable feeling that there ought to be one
i not in the depths of despair this morning i never can be in the morning isnt it a splendid thing that there are morning
but i feel very sad i ve just been imagining that it was really me you wanted after all and that i was to stay here for ever and ever
it was a great comfort while it lasted but the worst of imagining thing is that the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts
you better get dressed and come down stairs and never mind your imaginings said miss_marilla_cuthbert as soon as she could get a word in edgewise
breakfast is waiting wash your face and comb your hair leave the window up and turn your bedclothes back over the foot of the bed
anne_shirley could evidently be smart to some purpose for she was down stairs in ten minute time with her clothes neatly on her hair brushed and braided her face washed and a comfortable consciousness pervading her soul that she had fulfilled all miss_marilla_cuthbert requirements
be as smart as you can as a matter of fact however she had forgotten to turn back the bedclothes
i pretty hungry this morning she announced as she slipped into the chair miss_marilla_cuthbert placed for her the world doesnt seem such a howling wilderness as it did last night
i so glad it a sunshiny morning but i like rainy morning real well too all sorts of morning are interesting dont you think
but i glad it not rainy today because it easier to be cheerful and bear up under affliction on a sunshiny day
you dont know what going to happen through the day and there so much scope for imagination i feel that i have a good deal to bear up under
it all very well to read about sorrows and imagine yourself living through them heroically but it not so nice when you really come to have them is it
thereupon anne_shirley held her tongue so obediently and thoroughly that her continued silence made miss_marilla_cuthbert rather nervous as if in the presence of something not exactly natural
for pity sake hold your tongue said miss_marilla_cuthbert you talk entirely too much for a little girl matthew_cuthbert also held his
as it progressed anne_shirley became more and more abstracted eating mechanically with her big eye fixed unswervingly and unseeingly on the sky outside the window
this made miss_marilla_cuthbert more nervous than ever she had an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd child body might be there at the table her spirit was far away in some remote airy cloudland borne aloft on the wings of imagination
tongue but this was natural so that the meal was a very silent one who would want such a child about the place
miss_marilla_cuthbert felt that he wanted it just as much this morning as he had the night before and that he would go on wanting it
take a whim into his head and cling to it with the most amazing silent persistency a persistency ten time more potent and effectual in its very silence than if he had talked it out
yet matthew_cuthbert wished to keep her of all unaccountable thing that was matthew_cuthbert way when the meal was ended anne_shirley came out of her reverie and offered to wash the dishes
can you wash dishes right asked miss_marilla_cuthbert distrustfully pretty well i better at looking after child though i ve had so much experience at that
it such a pity you havent any here for me to look after i dont feel as if i wanted any more child to look after than i ve got at present
you re problem enough in all conscience what to be done with you i dont know matthew_cuthbert is a most ridiculous man
i think he lovely said anne_shirley reproachfully he is so very sympathetic he didnt mind how much i talked he seemed to like it
i felt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever i saw him you re both queer enough if that what you mean by kindred spirit said miss_marilla_cuthbert with a sniff
i ve got enough to attend to this morning for i ll have to drive over to white sands in the afternoon and see mrs_alexander_spencer
yes you may wash the dishes take plenty of hot water and be sure you dry them well you ll come with me and we ll settle what to be done with you
after you ve finished the dishes go up stairs and make your bed anne_shirley washed the dishes deftly enough as miss_marilla_cuthbert who kept a sharp eye on the process discerned
later on she made her bed less successfully for she had never learned the art of wrestling with a feather tick
but is was done somehow and smoothed down and then miss_marilla_cuthbert to get rid of her told her she might go out of door and amuse herself until dinner time
on the very threshold she stopped short wheeled about came back and sat down by the table light and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an extinguisher on her
anne_shirley flew to the door face alight eye glowing what the matter now demanded miss_marilla_cuthbert i dont dare go out said anne_shirley in the tone of a martyr relinquishing all earthly joys
and if i go out there and get acquainted with all those tree and flower and the orchard and the brook i ll not be able to help loving it
if i cant stay here there is no use in my loving green gables it hard enough now so i wont make it any harder
i want to go out so much everything seems to be calling to me anne_shirley anne_shirley come out to us anne_shirley anne_shirley we want a playmate but it better not
there is no use in loving thing if you have to be torn from them is there and it so hard to keep from loving thing isnt it
that was why i was so glad when i thought i was going to live here i thought i have so many thing to love and nothing to hinder me
but that brief dream is over i am resigned to my fate now so i dont think i ll go out for fear
i ll get unresigned again what is the name of that geranium on the window sill please that the apple scented geranium
oh i dont mean that sort of a name i mean just a name you gave it yourself didnt you give it a name
may i give it one then may i call it let me see bonny would do may i call it bonny while i here
oh do let me goodness i dont care but where on earth is the sense of naming a geranium oh i like thing to have handles even if they are only geraniums
it makes them seem more like people how do you know but that it hurts a geranium feeling just to be called a geranium and nothing else
you wouldnt like to be called nothing but a woman all the time yes i shall call it bonny i named that cherry tree outside my bedroom window this morning
i called it snow queen because it was so white of course it wont always be in blossom but one can imagine that it is cant one
i never in all my life saw or heard anything to equal her muttered miss_marilla_cuthbert beating a retreat down to the cellar after potatoes
she is kind of interesting as matthew_cuthbert says i can feel already that i wondering what on earth she ll say next
she ll be casting a spell over me too she cast it over matthew_cuthbert that look he gave me when he went out
said everything he said or hinted last night over again i wish he was like other man and would talk thing out
a body could answer back then and argue him into reason but what to be done with a man who just look
anne_shirley had relapsed into reverie with her chin in her hand and her eye on the sky when miss_marilla_cuthbert returned from her cellar pilgrimage
there miss_marilla_cuthbert left her until the early dinner was on the table i suppose i can have the mare and buggy this afternoon matthew_cuthbert said miss_marilla_cuthbert
matthew_cuthbert nodded and looked wistfully at anne_shirley miss_marilla_cuthbert intercepted the look and said grimly i going to drive over to white sands and settle this thing
i ll take anne_shirley with me and mrs_alexander_spencer will probably make arrangements to send her back to nova scotia at once
i ll set your tea out for you and i ll be home in time to milk the cows still matthew_cuthbert said nothing and miss_marilla_cuthbert had a sense of having wasted word and breath
there is nothing more aggravating than a man who wont talk back unless it is a woman who wont matthew_cuthbert hitched the sorrel into the buggy in due time and miss_marilla_cuthbert and anne_shirley set off
matthew_cuthbert opened the yard gate for them and as they drove slowly through he said to nobody in particular as it seemed little jerry buote from the creek was here this morning and i told him i guessed i hire him for the summer
miss_marilla_cuthbert made no reply but she hit the unlucky sorrel such a vicious clip with the whip that the fat mare unused to such treatment whizzed indignantly down the lane at an alarming pace
miss_marilla_cuthbert looked back once as the buggy bounced along and saw that aggravating matthew_cuthbert leaning over the gate looking wistfully after them
it been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy thing if you make up your mind firmly that you will
chapter anne_shirley history do you know said anne_shirley confidentially i ve made up my mind to enjoy this drive of course you must make it up firmly
i am not going to think about going back to the asylum while we re having our drive i just going to think about the drive
oh look there one little early wild rose out isnt it lovely dont you think it must be glad to be a rose
wouldnt it be nice if roses could talk i sure they could tell us such lovely thing and isnt pink the most bewitching color in the world
did you ever know of anybody whose hair was red when she was young but got to be another color when she grew up
no i dont know as i ever did said miss_marilla_cuthbert mercilessly and i shouldnt think it likely to happen in your case either
i love it but i cant wear it redheaded people cant wear pink not even in imagination anne_shirley sighed
that a sentence i read in a book once and i say it over to comfort myself whenever i disappointed in anything
well that is another hope gone my life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes i dont see where the comforting comes in myself said miss_marilla_cuthbert
why because it sounds so nice and romantic just as if i were a heroine in a book you know
i am so fond of romantic thing and a graveyard full of buried hopes is about as romantic a thing as one can imagine isnt it
i rather glad i have one are we going across the lake of shining waters today we re not going over diana_barry pond if that what you mean by your lake of shining waters
we re going by the shore road shore road sounds nice said anne_shirley dreamily is it as nice as it sounds
just when you said shore road i saw it in a picture in my mind as quick as that and white sands is a pretty name too but i dont like it as well as avonlea
it five miles and as you re evidently bent on talking you might as well talk to some purpose by telling me what you know about yourself
avonlea is a lovely name it just sounds like music how far is it to white sands oh what i know about myself isnt really worth telling said anne_shirley eagerly
if you ll only let me tell you what i imagine about myself you ll think it ever so much more interesting
no i dont want any of your imaginings just you stick to bald facts begin at the beginning where were you born and how old are you
i was eleven last march said anne_shirley resigning herself to bald facts with a little sigh and i was born in bolingbroke nova scotia
my father name was walter anne_shirley and he was a teacher in the bolingbroke high school my mother name was bertha anne_shirley
arent walter and bertha lovely name i so glad my parents had nice name it would be a real disgrace to have a father named well say jedediah wouldnt it
i guess it doesnt matter what a person name is as long as he behaves himself said miss_marilla_cuthbert feeling herself called upon to inculcate a good and useful moral
i read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet but i ve never been able to believe it
well i dont know anne_shirley looked thoughtful i dont believe a rose would be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage
i suppose my father could have been a good man even if he had been called jedediah but i sure it would have been a cross
well my mother was a teacher in the high school too but when she married father she gave up teaching of course
a husband was enough responsibility mrs_thomas said that they were a pair of babies and as poor as church mice
they went to live in a weeny teeny little yellow house in bolingbroke i ve never seen that house but i ve imagined it thousands of time
i think it must have had honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and lilies of the valley just inside the gate
yes and muslin curtains in all the window muslin curtains give a house such an air i was born in that house
mrs_thomas said i was the homeliest baby she ever saw i was so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eye but that mother thought i was perfectly beautiful
i should think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came in to scrub wouldnt you
i would feel so sad if i thought i was a disappointment to her because she didnt live very long after that you see
i glad she was satisfied with me anyhow she died of fever when i was just three months old i do wish she lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother
i think it would be so sweet to say mother dont you and father died four day afterwards from fever too
that left me an orphan and folks were at their wits end so mrs_thomas said what to do with me
you see nobody wanted me even then it seems to be my fate father and mother had both come from place far away
and it was well known they hadnt any relatives living finally mrs_thomas said she take me though she was poor and had a drunken husband
do you know if there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other people
because whenever i was naughty mrs_thomas would ask me how i could be such a bad girl when she had brought me up by hand
mr and mrs_thomas moved away from bolingbroke to marysville and i lived with them until i was eight year old
i helped look after the mrs_thomas child there were four of them younger than me and i can tell you they took a lot of looking after
then mr mrs_thomas was killed falling under a train and his mother offered to take mrs_thomas and the child but she didnt want me
she brought me up by hand reproachful like mrs_thomas was at her wits end so she said what to do with me
then mrs_hammond from up the river came down and said she take me seeing i was handy with child and i went up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the stumps
it was a very lonesome place i sure i could never have lived there if i hadnt had an imagination mr mrs_hammond worked a little sawmill up there and mrs_hammond had eight child
she had twins three time i like babies in moderation but twins three time in succession is too much i told mrs_hammond so firmly when the last pair came
i lived up river with mrs_hammond over two year and then mr mrs_hammond died and mrs_hammond broke up housekeeping
i used to get so dreadfully tired carrying them about she divided her child among her relatives and went to the states
i had to go to the asylum at hopeton because nobody would take me they didnt want me at the asylum either they said they were over crowded as it was
but they had to take me and i was there four months until mrs_alexander_spencer came anne_shirley finished up with another sigh of relief this time
evidently she did not like talking about her experiences in a world that had not wanted her did you ever go to school
demanded miss_marilla_cuthbert turning the sorrel mare down the shore road not a great deal i went a little the last year i stayed with mrs_thomas
when i went up river we were so far from a school that i couldnt walk it in winter and there was a vacation in summer so i could only go in the spring and fall
and i know ever so many pieces of poetry off by heart the battle of hohenlinden and edinburgh after flodden and bingen of the rhine and most of the lady of the lake and most of the seasons by james thompson
but of course i went while i was at the asylum i can read pretty well dont you just love poetry that gives you a crinkly feeling up and down your back
of course i wasnt in the fifth reader i was only in the fourth but the big girl used to lend me theirs to read
there is a piece in the fifth reader the downfall of poland that is just full of thrills were those woman mrs_thomas and mrs_hammond good to you
asked miss_marilla_cuthbert looking at anne_shirley out of the corner of her eye o h faltered anne_shirley her sensitive little face suddenly flushed scarlet and embarrassment sat on her brow
oh they meant to be i know they meant to be just as good and kind as possible and when people mean to be good to you you dont mind very much when they re not quite always
it a very trying to have a drunken husband you see and it must be very trying to have twins three time in succession dont you think
they had a good deal to worry them you know but i feel sure they meant to be good to me
anne_shirley gave herself up to a silent rapture over the shore road and miss_marilla_cuthbert guided the sorrel abstractedly while she pondered deeply
what a starved unloved life she had had a life of drudgery and poverty and neglect for miss_marilla_cuthbert was shrewd enough to read between the lines of anne_shirley history and divine the truth
miss_marilla_cuthbert asked no more questions pity was suddenly stirring in her heart for the child no wonder she had been so delighted at the prospect of a real home
it was a pity she had to be sent back what if she miss_marilla_cuthbert should indulge matthew_cuthbert unaccountable whim and let her stay
he was set on it and the child seemed a nice teachable little thing she got too much to say thought miss_marilla_cuthbert but she might be trained out of that
and there nothing rude or slangy in what she does say she ladylike it likely her people were nice folks
on the right hand scrub firs their spirit quite unbroken by long year of tussle with the gulf winds grew thickly
on the left were the steep red sandstone cliffs so near the track in place that a mare of less steadiness than the sorrel might have tried the nerves of the people behind her
down at the base of the cliffs were heaps of surf worn rocks or little sandy coves inlaid with pebbles as with ocean jewels beyond lay the sea shimmering and blue and over it soared the gulls their pinions flashing silvery in the sunlight
the shore road was woodsy and wild and lonesome isnt the sea wonderful said anne_shirley rousing from a long wide eyed silence
once when i lived in marysville mr mrs_thomas hired an express wagon and took us all to spend the day at the shore ten miles away
i enjoyed every moment of that day even if i had to look after the child all the time i lived it over in happy dream for year
but this shore is nicer than the marysville shore arent those gulls splendid would you like to be a gull i think i would that is if i couldnt be a human girl
dont you think it would be nice to wake up at sunrise and swoop down over the water and away out over that lovely blue all day and then at night to fly back to one nest
oh i can just imagine myself doing it what big house is that just ahead please that the white sands hotel
mr kirke runs it but the season hasnt begun yet there are heaps of americans come there for the summer they think this shore is just about right
i was afraid it might be mrs_alexander_spencer place said anne_shirley mournfully i dont want to get there somehow it will seem like the end of everything
mrs_alexander_spencer lived in a big yellow house at white sands cove and she came to the door with surprise and welcome mingled on her benevolent face
chapter vi miss_marilla_cuthbert makes up her mind get there they did however in due season dear dear she exclaimed you re the last folks i was looking for today but i real glad to see you
you ll put your horse in and how are you anne_shirley i as well as can be expected thank you said anne_shirley smilelessly
a blight seemed to have descended on her i suppose we ll stay a little while to rest the mare said miss_marilla_cuthbert but i promised matthew_cuthbert
i be home early the fact is mrs_alexander_spencer there been a queer mistake somewhere and i ve come over to see where it is
we send word matthew_cuthbert and i for you to bring us a boy from the asylum we told your brother robert to tell you we wanted a boy ten or eleven year old
miss_marilla_cuthbert you dont say so said mrs_alexander_spencer in distress why robert sent word down by his daughter nancy
and she said you wanted a girl didnt she flora jane_andrews appealing to her daughter who had come out to the steps
she certainly did miss_marilla_cuthbert corroborated flora jane_andrews earnestly i dreadful sorry said mrs_alexander_spencer it too bad but it certainly wasnt my fault you see miss_marilla_cuthbert
i did the best i could and i thought i was following your instructions nancy is a terrible flighty thing i ve often had to scold her well for her heedlessness
we should have come to you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along by word of mouth in that fashion
it was our own fault said miss_marilla_cuthbert resignedly anyhow the mistake has been made and the only thing to do is to set it right
can we send the child back to the asylum i suppose they ll take her back wont they i suppose so said mrs_alexander_spencer thoughtfully but i dont think it will be necessary to send her back
mrs_peter_blewett was up here yesterday and she was saying to me how much she wished she sent by me for a little girl to help her
mrs_peter_blewett has a large family you know and she finds it hard to get help anne_shirley will be the very girl for you
i call it positively providential miss_marilla_cuthbert did not look as if she thought providence had much to do with the matter
here was an unexpectedly good chance to get this unwelcome orphan off her hand and she did not even feel grateful for it
she knew mrs_peter_blewett only by sight as a small shrewish faced woman without an ounce of superfluous flesh on her bones
a terrible worker and driver mrs_peter_blewett was said to be and discharged servant girl told fearsome tales of her temper and stinginess and her family of pert quarrelsome child
but she had heard of her miss_marilla_cuthbert felt a qualm of conscience at the thought of handing anne_shirley over to her tender mercies
well i ll go in and we ll talk the matter over she said and if there isnt mrs_peter_blewett coming up the lane this blessed minute
exclaimed mrs_alexander_spencer bustling her guests through the hall into the parlor where a deadly chill struck on them as if the air had been strained so long through dark green closely drawn blinds that it had lost every particle of warmth it had ever possessed
that is real lucky for we can settle the matter right away take the armchair miss_marilla_cuthbert anne_shirley you sit here on the ottoman and dont wiggle
let me take your hats flora jane_andrews go out and put the kettle on good afternoon mrs_peter_blewett we were just saying how fortunate it was you happened along
let me introduce you two lady mrs_peter_blewett miss_marilla_cuthbert please excuse me for just a moment i forgot to tell flora jane_andrews to take the buns out of the oven
anne_shirley sitting mutely on the ottoman with her hand clasped tightly in her lap stared at mrs_peter_blewett as one fascinated
mrs_alexander_spencer whisked away after pulling up the blinds was she to be given into the keeping of this sharp faced sharp eyed woman
she was beginning to be afraid she couldnt keep the tear back when mrs_alexander_spencer returned flushed and beaming quite capable of taking any and every difficulty physical mental or spiritual into consideration and settling it out of hand
she felt a lump coming up in her throat and her eye smarted painfully it seems there been a mistake about this little girl mrs_peter_blewett she said
i was under the impression that mr and miss_marilla_cuthbert wanted a little girl to adopt i was certainly told so
but it seems it was a boy they wanted so if you re still of the same mind you were yesterday i think she ll be just the thing for you
mrs_peter_blewett darted her eye over anne_shirley from head to foot how old are you and what your name
anne_shirley faltered the shrinking child not daring to make any stipulations regarding the spelling thereof and i eleven year old
she demanded humph you dont look as if there was much to you but you re wiry i dont know but the wiry one are the best after all
well if i take you you ll have to be a good girl you know good and smart and respectful i ll expect you to earn your keep and no mistake about that
yes i suppose i might as well take her off your hand miss_marilla_cuthbert the baby awful fractious and i clean worn out attending to him
miss_marilla_cuthbert looked at anne_shirley and softened at sight of the child pale face with its look of mute misery the misery of a helpless little creature who finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped
miss_marilla_cuthbert felt an uncomfortable conviction that if she denied the appeal of that look it would haunt her to her dying day
if you like i can take her right home now more over she did not fancy mrs_peter_blewett to hand a sensitive highstrung child over to such a woman
no she could not take the responsibility of doing that well i dont know she said slowly i didnt say that matthew_cuthbert and i had absolutely decided that we wouldnt keep her
in fact i may say that matthew_cuthbert is disposed to keep her i just came over to find out how the mistake had occurred
i think i better take her home again and talk it over with matthew_cuthbert i feel that i oughtnt to decide on anything without consulting him
if we make up our mind not to keep her we ll bring or send her over to you tomorrow night if we dont you may know that she is going to stay with us
will that suit you mrs_peter_blewett i suppose it ll have to said mrs_peter_blewett ungraciously during miss_marilla_cuthbert speech a sunrise had been dawning on anne_shirley face
first the look of despair faded out then came a faint flush of hope her eye grew deep and bright as morning stars
the child was quite transfigured and a moment later when mrs_alexander_spencer and mrs_peter_blewett went out in quest of a recipe the latter had come to borrow
she sprang up and flew across the room to miss_marilla_cuthbert oh miss_marilla_cuthbert did you really say that perhaps you would let me stay at green gables
she said in a breathless whisper as if speaking aloud might shatter the glorious possibility did you really say it
i think you better learn to control that imagination of yours anne_shirley if you cant distinguish between what is real and what isnt said miss_marilla_cuthbert crossly
or did i only imagine that you did yes you did hear me say just that and no more it isnt decided yet and perhaps we will conclude to let mrs_peter_blewett take you after all
she certainly needs you much more than i do i rather go back to the asylum than go to live with her said anne_shirley passionately
she look exactly like a like a gimlet miss_marilla_cuthbert smothered a smile under the conviction that anne_shirley must be reproved for such a speech
a little girl like you should be ashamed of talking so about a lady and a stranger she said severely
i ll try to do and be anything you want me if you ll only keep me said anne_shirley returning meekly to her ottoman
go back and sit down quietly and hold your tongue and behave as a good girl should when they arrived back at green gables that evening matthew_cuthbert met them in the lane
she was prepared for the relief she read in his face when he saw that she had at least brought back anne_shirley back with her
but she said nothing to him relative to the affair until they were both out in the yard behind the barn milking the cows
miss_marilla_cuthbert from afar had noted him prowling along it and guessed his motive then she briefly told him anne_shirley history and the result of the interview with mrs_alexander_spencer
i wouldnt give a dog i liked to that mrs_peter_blewett woman said matthew_cuthbert with unusual vim i dont fancy her style myself admitted miss_marilla_cuthbert but it that or keeping her ourselves matthew_cuthbert
and since you seem to want her i suppose i willing or have to be i ve been thinking over the idea until i ve got kind of used to it
it seems a sort of duty i ve never brought up a child especially a girl and i dare say i ll make a terrible mess of it
but i ll do my best so far as i concerned matthew_cuthbert she may stay matthew_cuthbert shy face was a glow of delight
well now i reckoned you come to see it in that light miss_marilla_cuthbert he said she such an interesting little thing
it be more to the point if you could say she was a useful little thing retorted miss_marilla_cuthbert but i ll make it my business to see she trained to be that
perhaps an old maid doesnt know much about bringing up a child but i guess she knows more than an old bachelor
and mind matthew_cuthbert you re not to go interfering with my methods so you just leave me to manage her when i fail it ll be time enough to put your oar in
there there miss_marilla_cuthbert you can have your own way said matthew_cuthbert reassuringly only be as good and kind to her as you can without spoiling her
i kind of think she one of the sort you can do anything with if you only get her to love you
miss_marilla_cuthbert sniffed to express her contempt for matthew_cuthbert opinions concerning anything feminine and walked off to the dairy with the pails
i wont tell her tonight that she can stay she reflected as she strained the milk into the creamers
she be so excited that she wouldnt sleep a wink miss_marilla_cuthbert you re fairly in for it did you ever suppose you see the day when you be adopting an orphan girl
it surprising enough but not so surprising as that matthew_cuthbert should be at the bottom of it him that always seemed to have such a mortal dread of little girl
anyhow we ve decided on the experiment and goodness only knows what will come of it chapter vii anne_shirley says her prayer when
that night she said stiffly now anne_shirley i noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about the floor when you took them off
miss_marilla_cuthbert took anne_shirley up to bed that is a very untidy habit and i cant allow it at all as soon as you take off any article of clothing fold it neatly and place it on the chair
i was so harrowed up in my mind last night that i didnt think about my clothes at all said anne_shirley
i havent any use at all for little girl who arent neat i ll fold them nicely tonight they always made us do that at the asylum
half the time though i forget i be in such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine thing
you ll have to remember a little better if you stay here admonished miss_marilla_cuthbert there that look something like say your prayer now and get into bed
i never say any prayer announced anne_shirley miss_marilla_cuthbert looked horrified astonishment why anne_shirley what do you mean were you never taught to say your prayer
god is a spirit infinite eternal and unchangeable in his being wisdom power holiness justice goodness and truth responded anne_shirley promptly and glibly
god always wants little girl to say their prayer dont you know who god is anne_shirley miss_marilla_cuthbert looked rather relieved
so you do know something then thank goodness you re not quite a heathen where did you learn that oh at the asylum sunday school
they made us learn the whole catechism i liked it pretty well there something splendid about some of the word
infinite eternal and unchangeable isnt that grand it has such a roll to it just like a big organ playing you couldnt quite call it poetry i suppose but it sounds a lot like it doesnt it
we re not talking about poetry anne_shirley we are talking about saying your prayer dont you know it a terrible wicked thing not to say your prayer every night
i afraid you are a very bad little girl you find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair said anne_shirley reproachfully
people who havent red hair dont know what trouble is mrs_thomas told me that god made my hair red on purpose and i ve never cared about him since
and anyhow i always be too tired at night to bother saying prayer people who have to look after twins cant be expected to say their prayer
now do you honestly think they can miss_marilla_cuthbert decided that anne_shirley religious training must be begun at once plainly there was no time to be lost
you must say your prayer while you are under my roof anne_shirley why of course if you want me to assented anne_shirley cheerfully
i do anything to oblige you but you ll have to tell me what to say for this once after i get into bed i ll imagine out a real nice prayer to say always
i believe that it will be quite interesting now that i come to think of it you must kneel down said miss_marilla_cuthbert in embarrassment
anne_shirley knelt at miss_marilla_cuthbert knee and looked up gravely why must people kneel down to pray if i really wanted to pray i ll tell you what i do
i go out into a great big field all alone or into the deep deep wood and i look up into the sky up up up into that lovely blue sky that look as if there was no end to its blueness
and then i just feel a prayer well i ready what am i to say miss_marilla_cuthbert felt more embarrassed than ever
but she had as i have told you the glimmerings of a sense of humor which is simply another name for a sense of fitness of thing and it suddenly occurred to her that that simple little prayer sacred to white robed childhood lisping at motherly knees was entirely unsuited to this freckled witch of a girl who knew and cared nothing about god love since she had never had it translated to her through the medium of human love
she had intended to teach anne_shirley the childish classic now i lay me down to sleep you re old enough to pray for yourself anne_shirley she said finally
just thank god for your blessings and ask him humbly for the thing you want well i ll do my best promised anne_shirley burying her face in miss_marilla_cuthbert lap
gracious heavenly father that the way the minister say it in church so i suppose it all right in private prayer isnt it
gracious heavenly father i thank thee for the white way of delight and the lake of shining waters and bonny and the snow queen
she interjected lifting her head for a moment i really extremely grateful for them and that all the blessings i can think of just now to thank thee for
as for the thing i want they re so numerous that it would take a great deal of time to name them all
so i will only mention the two most important please let me stay at green gables and please let me be good looking when i grow up
i remain yours respectfully anne_shirley there did i do all right she asked eagerly getting up i could have made it much more flowery if i had a little more time to think it over
poor miss_marilla_cuthbert was only preserved from complete collapse by remembering that it was not irreverence but simply spiritual ignorance on the part of anne_shirley that was responsible for this extraordinary petition
she tucked the child up in bed mentally vowing that she should be taught a prayer the very next day and was leaving the room with the light when anne_shirley called her back
i ve just thought of it now i should have said amen in place of yours respectfully shouldnt i the way the minister do
i forgotten it but i felt a prayer should be finished off in some way so i put in the other
do you suppose it will make any difference i i dont suppose it will said miss_marilla_cuthbert go to sleep now like a good child
good night i can only say good night tonight with a clear conscience said anne_shirley cuddling luxuriously down among her pillows
miss_marilla_cuthbert retreated to the kitchen set the candle firmly on the table and glared at matthew_cuthbert matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert it about time somebody adopted that child and taught her something
she next door to a perfect heathen will you believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight
i ll send her to the manse tomorrow and borrow the peep of the day series that what i ll do and she shall go to sunday school just as soon as i can get some suitable clothes made for her
i foresee that i shall have my hand full well well we cant get through this world without our share of trouble
i ve had a pretty easy life of it so far but my time has come at last and i suppose i ll just have to make the best of it
is begun for reasons best known to herself miss_marilla_cuthbert did not tell anne_shirley that she was to stay at green gables until the next afternoon
during the forenoon she kept the child busy with various tasks and watched over her with a keen eye while she did them
by noon she had concluded that anne_shirley was smart and obedient willing to work and quick to learn her most serious shortcoming seemed to be a tendency to fall into daydreams in the middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as she was sharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe
when anne_shirley had finished washing the dinner dishes she suddenly confronted miss_marilla_cuthbert with the air and expression of one desperately determined to learn the worst
her thin little body trembled from head to foot her face flushed and her eye dilated until they were almost black she clasped her hand tightly and said in an imploring voice oh please miss_marilla_cuthbert wont you tell me if you are going to send me away or not
chapter viii anne_shirley bringing up i ve tried to be patient all the morning but i really feel that i cannot bear not knowing any longer
it a dreadful feeling please tell me you havent scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as i told you to do said miss_marilla_cuthbert immovably
just go and do it before you ask any more questions anne_shirley anne_shirley went and attended to the dishcloth
well said miss_marilla_cuthbert unable to find any excuse for deferring her explanation longer i suppose i might as well tell you
matthew_cuthbert and i have decided to keep you that is if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself grateful
then she returned to miss_marilla_cuthbert and fastened imploring eye of the latter face why child whatever is the matter i crying said anne_shirley in a tone of bewilderment
i cant think why i glad as glad can be oh glad doesnt seem the right word at all i was glad about the white way and the cherry blossoms but this
oh it something more than glad i so happy i ll try to be so good it will be uphill work i expect for mrs_thomas often told me i was desperately wicked
however i ll do my very best but can you tell me why i crying i suppose it because you re all excited and worked up said miss_marilla_cuthbert disapprovingly
sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself i afraid you both cry and laugh far too easily
yes you can stay here and we will try to do right by you you must go to school but it only a fortnight till vacation
so it isnt worth while for you to start before it opens again in september what am i to call you asked anne_shirley
shall i always say miss_marilla_cuthbert can i call you aunt miss_marilla_cuthbert no you ll call me just plain miss_marilla_cuthbert
i not used to being called miss_marilla_cuthbert and it would make me nervous it sounds awfully disrespectful to just say miss_marilla_cuthbert protested anne_shirley
i guess there ll be nothing disrespectful in it if you re careful to speak respectfully everybody young and old in avonlea calls me miss_marilla_cuthbert except the minister
he says miss_marilla_cuthbert when he thinks of it i love to call you aunt miss_marilla_cuthbert said anne_shirley wistfully
i ve never had an aunt or any relation at all not even a grandmother it would make me feel as if i really belonged to you
cant i call you aunt miss_marilla_cuthbert no i not your aunt and i dont believe in calling people name that dont belong to them
but we could imagine you were my aunt i couldnt said miss_marilla_cuthbert grimly do you never imagine thing different from what they really are
asked anne_shirley wide eyed no oh anne_shirley drew a long breath oh miss miss_marilla_cuthbert how much you miss i dont believe in imagining thing different from what they really are retorted miss_marilla_cuthbert
when the lord puts us in certain circumstances he doesnt mean for us to imagine them away and that reminds me
go into the sitting room anne_shirley be sure your feet are clean and dont let any flies in and bring me out the illustrated card that on the mantelpiece
the lord prayer is on it and you ll devote your spare time this afternoon to learning it off by heart there to be no more of such praying as i heard last night
i suppose i was very awkward said anne_shirley apologetically but then you see i never had any practice you couldnt really expect a person to pray very well the first time she tried could you
i thought out a splendid prayer after i went to bed just as i promised you i would it was nearly as long as a minister and so poetical
but would you believe it i couldnt remember one word when i woke up this morning and i afraid i ll never be able to think out another one as good
somehow thing never are so good when they re thought out a second time have you ever noticed that here is something for you to notice anne_shirley
when i tell you to do a thing i want you to obey me at once and not stand stock still and discourse about it
anne_shirley promptly departed for the sitting room across the hall she failed to return after waiting ten minute miss_marilla_cuthbert laid down her knitting and marched after her with a grim expression
she found anne_shirley standing motionless before a picture hanging on the wall between the two window with her eye a star with dream
the white and green light strained through apple tree and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt little figure with a half unearthly radiance
just you go and do as i bid you anne_shirley whatever are you thinking of demanded miss_marilla_cuthbert sharply
anne_shirley came back to earth with a start that she said pointing to the picture a rather vivid chromo entitled christ blessing
that i was the little girl in the blue dress standing off by herself in the corner as if she didnt belong to anybody like me
little child and i was just imagining i was one of them she look lonely and sad dont you think i guess she hadnt any father or mother of her own
but she wanted to be blessed too so she just crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd hoping nobody would notice her except him
her heart must have beat and her hand must have got cold like mine did when i asked you if i could stay
i sure i know just how she felt she was afraid he mightnt notice her but it likely he did dont you think
her edging a little nearer all the time until she was quite close to him and then he would look at her and put his hand on her hair
i ve been trying to imagine it all out and oh such a thrill of joy as would run over her but i wish the artist hadnt painted him so sorrowful looking
all his pictures are like that if you ve noticed but i dont believe he could really have looked so sad or the child would have been afraid of him
anne_shirley said miss_marilla_cuthbert wondering why she had not broken into this speech long before you shouldnt talk that way it irreverent positively irreverent
anne_shirley eye marveled why i felt just as reverent as could be i sure i didnt mean to be irreverent
and another thing anne_shirley when i send you after something you re to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and imagining before pictures
well i dont suppose you did but it doesnt sound right to talk so familiarly about such thing remember that
take that card and come right to the kitchen now sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by heart
anne_shirley set the card up against the jugful of apple blossoms she had brought in to decorate the dinner table miss_marilla_cuthbert had eyed that decoration askance but had said nothing propped her chin on her hand and fell to studying it intently for several silent minute
i like this she announced at length it beautiful i ve heard it before i heard the superintendent of the asylum sunday school say it over once
but i didnt like it then he had such a cracked voice and he prayed it so mournfully i really felt sure he thought praying was a disagreeable duty
this isnt poetry but it makes me feel just the same way poetry does our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
that is just like a line of music oh i so glad you thought of making me learn this miss miss_marilla_cuthbert
anne_shirley tipped the vase of apple blossoms near enough to bestow a soft kiss on a pink cupped bud and then studied diligently for some moment longer
well learn it and hold your tongue said miss_marilla_cuthbert shortly miss_marilla_cuthbert she demanded presently do you think that i shall ever have a bosom friend in avonlea
a a what kind of friend a bosom friend an intimate friend you know a really kindred spirit to whom i can confide my inmost soul
i never really supposed i would but so many of my loveliest dream have come true all at once that perhaps this one will too
i ve dreamed of meeting her all my life do you think it possible diana_barry life over at orchard slope and she about your age
she a very nice little girl and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when she comes home she visiting her aunt over at carmody just now
you ll have to be careful how you behave yourself though mrs diana_barry is a very particular woman she wont let diana_barry play with any little girl who isnt nice and good
anne_shirley looked at miss_marilla_cuthbert through the apple blossoms her eye aglow with interest what is diana_barry like her hair isnt red is it
oh i hope not it bad enough to have red hair myself but i positively couldnt endure it in a bosom friend
diana_barry is a very pretty little girl she has black eye and hair and rosy cheeks and she is good and smart which is better than being pretty
miss_marilla_cuthbert was as fond of morals as the duchess in wonderland and was firmly convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a child who was being brought up
but anne_shirley waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the delightful possibilities before it oh i so glad she pretty
next to being beautiful oneself and that impossible in my case it would be best to have a beautiful bosom friend when i lived with mrs_thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting room with glass door
there werent any book in it mrs_thomas kept her best china and her preserves there when she had any preserves to keep
but the other was whole and i used to pretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in it
one of the door was broken mr mrs_thomas smashed it one night when he was slightly intoxicated i called her katie maurice and we were very intimate
i used to talk to her by the hour especially on sunday and tell her everything katie was the comfort and consolation of my life
we used to pretend that the bookcase was enchanted and that if i only knew the spell i could open the door and step right into the room where katie maurice lived instead of into mrs_thomas shelves of preserves and china
and then katie maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a wonderful place all flower and sunshine and fairies and we would have lived there happy for ever after
when i went to live with mrs_hammond it just broke my heart to leave katie maurice she felt it dreadfully too
i know she did for she was crying when she kissed me good bye through the bookcase door there was no bookcase at mrs_hammond
but just up the river a little way from the house there was a long green little valley and the loveliest echo lived there
so i imagined that it was a little girl called violetta and we were great friend and i loved her almost as well
it echoed back every word you said even if you didnt talk a bit loud as i loved katie maurice not quite
the night before i went to the asylum i said good bye to violetta and oh her good bye came back to me in such sad sad tones
i had become so attached to her that i hadnt the heart to imagine a bosom friend at the asylum even if there had been any scope for imagination there
but almost you know i think it just as well there wasnt said miss_marilla_cuthbert drily i dont approve of such goings on
you seem to half believe your own imagination it will be well for you to have a real live friend to put such nonsense out of your head
but dont let mrs diana_barry hear you talking about your katie maurices and your violettas or she ll think you tell story
oh i wont i couldnt talk of them to everybody their memories are too sacred for that but i thought i like to have you know about them
oh look here a big bee just tumbled out of an apple blossom just think what a lovely place to live in an apple blossom
fancy going to sleep in it when the wind was rocking it if i wasnt a human girl i think i like to be a bee and live among the flower
yesterday you wanted to be a sea gull sniffed miss_marilla_cuthbert i think you are very fickle minded i told you to learn that prayer and not talk
but it seems impossible for you to stop talking if you ve got anybody that will listen to you so go up to your room and learn it
oh i know it pretty nearly all now all but just the last line well never mind do as i tell you
go to your room and finish learning it well and stay there until i call you down to help me get tea
can i take the apple blossoms with me for company pleaded anne_shirley no you dont want your room cluttered up with flower
you should have left them on the tree in the first place i did feel a little that way too said anne_shirley
i kind of felt i shouldnt shorten their lovely life by picking them i wouldnt want to be picked if i were an apple blossom
but the temptation was irresistible what do you do when you meet with an irresistible temptation anne_shirley did you hear me tell you to go to your room
anne_shirley sighed retreated to the east gable and sat down in a chair by the window there i know this prayer
i learned that last sentence coming upstairs now i going to imagine thing into this room so that they ll always stay imagined
the floor is covered with a white velvet carpet with pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the window
the walls are hung with gold and silver brocade tapestry the furniture is mahogany i never saw any mahogany but it does sound so luxurious
this is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions pink and blue and crimson and gold and i am reclining gracefully on it
i am tall and regal clad in a gown of trailing white lace with a pearl cross on my breast and pearls in my hair
i can see my reflection in that splendid big mirror hanging on the wall my hair is of midnight darkness and my skin is a clear ivory pallor
my name is the lady_cordelia_fitzgerald no it isnt i cant make that seem real she danced up to the little looking glass and peered into it
you re only anne_shirley of green gables she said earnestly and i see you just as you are looking now whenever i try to imagine i the lady_cordelia_fitzgerald
her pointed freckled face and solemn gray eye peered back at her but it a million time nicer to be anne_shirley of green gables than anne_shirley of nowhere in particular isnt it
she bent forward kissed her reflection affectionately and betook herself to the open window dear snow queen good afternoon
and good afternoon dear birches down in the hollow and good afternoon dear gray house up on the hill i wonder if diana_barry is to be my bosom friend
i hope she will and i shall love her very much but i must never quite forget katie maurice and violetta
they would feel so hurt if i did and i hate to hurt anybody feeling even a little bookcase girl or a little echo girl
anne_shirley blew a couple of airy kisses from her fingertips past the cherry blossoms and then with her chin in her hand drifted luxuriously out on a sea of daydreams
mrs_rachel_lynde is properly horrified anne_shirley had been a fortnight at green gables before mrs_rachel_lynde arrived to inspect her
i must be careful to remember them and send them a kiss every day chapter ix mrs_rachel_lynde to do her justice was not to blame for this
a severe and unseasonable attack of grippe had confined that good lady to her house ever since the occasion of her last visit to green gables
mrs_rachel_lynde was not often sick and had a well defined contempt for people who were but grippe she asserted was like no other illness on earth and could only be interpreted as one of the special visitations of providence
as soon as her doctor allowed her to put her foot out of door she hurried up to green gables bursting with curiosity to see matthew_cuthbert and miss_marilla_cuthbert orphan concerning whom all sorts of story and suppositions had gone abroad in avonlea
anne_shirley had made good use of every waking moment of that fortnight already she was acquainted with every tree and shrub about the place
she had discovered that a lane opened out below the apple orchard and ran up through a belt of woodland and she had explored it to its furthest end in all its delicious vagaries of brook and bridge fir coppice and wild cherry arch corners thick with fern and branching byways of maple and mountain ash
she had made friend with the spring down in the hollow that wonderful deep clear icy cold spring it was set about with smooth red sandstones and rimmed in by great palm like clumps of water fern and beyond it was a log bridge over the brook
that bridge led anne_shirley dancing feet up over a wooded hill beyond where perpetual twilight reigned under the straight thick growing firs and spruces the only flower there were myriads of delicate june bells those shyest and sweetest of woodland blooms and a few pale aerial starflowers like the spirit of last year blossoms
all these raptured voyages of exploration were made in the odd half hour which she was allowed for play and anne_shirley talked matthew_cuthbert and miss_marilla_cuthbert
gossamers glimmered like threads of silver among the tree and the fir boughs and tassels seemed to utter friendly speech half deaf over her discoveries
not that matthew_cuthbert complained to be sure he listened to it all with a wordless smile of enjoyment on his face miss_marilla_cuthbert permitted the chatter until she found herself becoming too interested in it whereupon she always promptly quenched anne_shirley by a curt command to hold her tongue
anne_shirley was out in the orchard when mrs_rachel_lynde came wandering at her own sweet will through the lush tremulous grasses splashed with ruddy evening sunshine so that good lady had an excellent chance to talk her illness fully over describing every ache and pulse beat with such evident enjoyment that miss_marilla_cuthbert thought even grippe must bring its compensations
when details were exhausted mrs_rachel_lynde introduced the real reason of her call i ve been hearing some surprising thing about you and matthew_cuthbert
i dont suppose you are any more surprised than i am myself said miss_marilla_cuthbert i getting over my surprise now
it was too bad there was such a mistake said mrs_rachel_lynde sympathetically couldnt you have sent her back
i suppose we could but we decided not to matthew_cuthbert took a fancy to her and i must say i like her myself although i admit she has her faults
the house seems a different place already she a real bright little thing miss_marilla_cuthbert said more than she had intended to say when she began for she read disapproval in mrs_rachel_lynde expression
it a great responsibility you ve taken on yourself said that lady gloomily especially when you ve never had any experience with child
you dont know much about her or her real disposition i suppose and there no guessing how a child like that will turn out
i not feeling discouraged was miss_marilla_cuthbert dry response when i make up my mind to do a thing it stays made up
but i dont want to discourage you i sure miss_marilla_cuthbert i suppose you like to see anne_shirley i ll call her in
anne_shirley came running in presently her face sparkling with the delight of her orchard rovings but abashed at finding the delight herself in the unexpected presence of a stranger she halted confusedly inside the door
she certainly was an odd looking little creature in the short tight wincey dress she had worn from the asylum below which her thin legs seemed ungracefully long
her freckles were more numerous and obtrusive than ever the wind had ruffled her hatless hair into over brilliant disorder it had never looked redder than at that moment
mrs_rachel_lynde was one of those delightful and popular people who pride themselves on speaking their mind without fear or favor
well they didnt pick you for your look that sure and certain was mrs_rachel_lynde emphatic comment
she terrible skinny and homely miss_marilla_cuthbert come here child and let me have a look at you lawful heart did any one ever see such freckles
and hair as red as carrots come here child i say anne_shirley came there but not exactly as mrs_rachel_lynde expected
with one bound she crossed the kitchen floor and stood before mrs_rachel_lynde her face scarlet with anger her lips quivering and her whole slender form trembling from head to foot
i hate you she cried in a choked voice stamping her foot on the floor i hate you i hate you
i hate you a louder stamp with each assertion of hatred how dare you call me skinny and ugly
how dare you say i freckled and redheaded you are a rude impolite unfeeling woman anne_shirley exclaimed miss_marilla_cuthbert in consternation
but anne_shirley continued to face mrs_rachel_lynde undauntedly head up eye blazing hand clenched passionate indignation exhaling from her like an atmosphere
how dare you say such thing about me she repeated vehemently how would you like to have such thing said about you
how would you like to be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably hadnt a spark of imagination in you
i dont care if i do hurt your feeling by saying so i hope i hurt them you have hurt mine worse than they were ever hurt before even by mrs_thomas intoxicated husband
and i ll never forgive you for it never never stamp stamp did anybody ever see such a temper exclaimed the horrified mrs_rachel_lynde
anne_shirley go to your room and stay there until i come up said miss_marilla_cuthbert recovering her powers of speech with difficulty
anne_shirley bursting into tear rushed to the hall door slammed it until the tins on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy and fled through the hall and up the stairs like a whirlwind
a subdued slam above told that the door of the east gable had been shut with equal vehemence well i dont envy you your job bringing that up miss_marilla_cuthbert said mrs_rachel_lynde with unspeakable solemnity
miss_marilla_cuthbert opened her lips to say she knew not what of apology or deprecation what she did say was a surprise to herself then and ever afterwards
miss_marilla_cuthbert you dont mean to say that you are upholding her in such a terrible display of temper as we ve just seen demanded mrs_rachel_lynde indignantly
you shouldnt have twitted her about her look mrs_rachel_lynde no said miss_marilla_cuthbert slowly i not trying to excuse her
she been very naughty and i ll have to give her a talking to about it but we must make allowances for her
she never been taught what is right and you were too hard on her mrs_rachel_lynde miss_marilla_cuthbert could not help tacking on that last sentence although she was again surprised at herself for doing it
well i see that i ll have to be very careful what i say after this miss_marilla_cuthbert since the fine feeling of orphan brought from goodness knows where have to be considered before anything else
mrs_rachel_lynde got up with an air of offended dignity oh no i not vexed dont worry yourself i too sorry for you to leave any room for anger in my mind
but if you ll take my advice which i suppose you wont do although i ve brought up ten child and buried two you ll do that talking to you mention with a fair sized birch switch
you ll have your own trouble with that child i should think that would be the most effective language for that kind of a child
her temper matches her hair i guess well good evening miss_marilla_cuthbert i hope you ll come down to see me often as usual
but you cant expect me to visit here again in a hurry if i liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion
whereat mrs_rachel_lynde swept out and away if a fat woman who always waddled could be said to sweep away and miss_marilla_cuthbert with a very solemn face betook herself to the east gable
it something new in my experience on the way upstairs she pondered uneasily as to what she ought to do
she felt no little dismay over the scene that had just been enacted how unfortunate that anne_shirley should have displayed such temper before mrs_rachel_lynde of all people
then miss_marilla_cuthbert suddenly became aware of an uncomfortable and rebuking consciousness that she felt more humiliation over this than sorrow over the discovery of such a serious defect in anne_shirley disposition
the amiable suggestion of the birch switch to the efficiency of which all of mrs_rachel_lynde own child could have borne smarting testimony did not appeal to miss_marilla_cuthbert
no some other method of punishment must be found to bring anne_shirley to a proper realization of the enormity of her offense
and how was she to punish her she did not believe she could whip a child miss_marilla_cuthbert found anne_shirley face downward on her bed crying bitterly quite oblivious of muddy boots on a clean counterpane
anne_shirley she said not ungently no answer anne_shirley with greater severity get off that bed this minute and listen to what i have to say to you
anne_shirley squirmed off the bed and sat rigidly on a chair beside it her face swollen and tear stained and her eye fixed stubbornly on the floor
this is a nice way for you to behave anne_shirley arent you ashamed of yourself she hadnt any right to call me ugly and redheaded retorted anne_shirley evasive and defiant
you hadnt any right to fly into such a fury and talk the way you did to her anne_shirley i was ashamed of you thoroughly ashamed of you
i wanted you to behave nicely to mrs_rachel_lynde and instead of that you have disgraced me i sure i dont know why you should lose your temper like that
just because mrs_rachel_lynde said you were red haired and homely you say it yourself often enough oh but there such a difference between saying a thing yourself and hearing other people say it wailed anne_shirley
you may know a thing is so but you cant help hoping other people dont quite think it is i suppose you think i have an awful temper but i couldnt help it
when she said those thing something just rose right up in me and choked me i had to fly out at her
well you made a fine exhibition of yourself i must say mrs_rachel_lynde will have a nice story to tell about you everywhere and she ll tell it too
just imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that you were skinny and ugly pleaded anne_shirley tearfully
it was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that anne_shirley an old remembrance suddenly rose up before miss_marilla_cuthbert
she had been a very small child when she had heard one aunt say of her to another what a pity she is such a dark homely little thing
i dont say that i think mrs_rachel_lynde was exactly right in saying what she did to you anne_shirley she admitted in a softer tone
miss_marilla_cuthbert was every day of fifty before the sting had gone out of that memory mrs_rachel_lynde is too outspoken
she was a stranger and an elderly person and my visitor all three very good reasons why you should have been respectful to her
you were rude and saucy and miss_marilla_cuthbert had a saving inspiration of punishment you must go to her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her to forgive you
but that is no excuse for such behavior on your part i can never do that said anne_shirley determinedly and darkly
you can shut me up in a dark damp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and water
you can punish me in any way you like miss_marilla_cuthbert and i shall not complain but i cannot ask mrs_rachel_lynde to forgive me
we re not in the habit of shutting people up in dark damp dungeons said miss_marilla_cuthbert drily especially as they re rather scarce in avonlea
but apologize to mrs_rachel_lynde you must and shall and you ll stay here in your room until you can tell me you re willing to do it
i shall have to stay here forever then said anne_shirley mournfully because i cant tell mrs_rachel_lynde i sorry i said those thing to her
how can i i not sorry i sorry i ve vexed you but i glad i told her just what i did
it was a great satisfaction i cant say i sorry when i not can i i cant even imagine i sorry
perhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the morning said miss_marilla_cuthbert rising to depart you ll have the night to think over your conduct in and come to a better frame of mind
you said you would try to be a very good girl if we kept you at green gables but i must say it hasnt seemed very much like it this evening
leaving this parthian shaft to rankle in anne_shirley stormy bosom miss_marilla_cuthbert descended to the kitchen grievously troubled in mind and vexed in soul
she was as angry with herself as with anne_shirley because whenever she recalled mrs_rachel_lynde dumbfounded countenance her lips twitched with amusement
chapter anne_shirley apology miss_marilla_cuthbert said nothing to matthew_cuthbert about the affair that evening but when anne_shirley proved still refractory the next morning an explanation had to be made to account for her absence from the breakfast table
miss_marilla_cuthbert told matthew_cuthbert the whole story taking pains to impress him with a due sense of the enormity of anne_shirley behavior
and she felt a most reprehensible desire to laugh it a good thing mrs_rachel_lynde got a calling down she a meddlesome old gossip was matthew_cuthbert consolatory rejoinder
matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert i astonished at you you know that anne_shirley behavior was dreadful and yet you take her part i suppose you ll be saying next thing that she oughtnt to be punished at all
well now no not exactly said matthew_cuthbert uneasily i reckon she ought to be punished a little but dont be too hard on her miss_marilla_cuthbert
recollect she hasnt ever had anyone to teach her right you re you re going to give her something to eat arent you
when did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior demanded miss_marilla_cuthbert indignantly she ll have her meals regular and i ll carry them up to her myself
but she ll stay up there until she willing to apologize to mrs_rachel_lynde and that final matthew_cuthbert breakfast dinner and supper were very silent meals for anne_shirley still remained obdurate
after each meal miss_marilla_cuthbert carried a well filled tray to the east gable and brought it down later on not noticeably depleted
when miss_marilla_cuthbert went out that evening to bring the cows from the back pasture matthew_cuthbert who had been hanging about the barns and watching slipped into the house with the air of a burglar and crept upstairs
as a general thing matthew_cuthbert gravitated between the kitchen and the little bedroom off the hall where he slept once in a while he ventured uncomfortably into the parlor or sitting room when the minister came to tea
but he had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he helped miss_marilla_cuthbert paper the spare bedroom and that was four year ago
he tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minute outside the door of the east gable before he summoned courage to tap on it with his fingers and then open the door to peep in
matthew_cuthbert eyed its last descent with a troubled eye had anne_shirley eaten anything at all anne_shirley was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out into the garden
very small and unhappy she looked and matthew_cuthbert heart smote him he softly closed the door and tiptoed over to her
anne_shirley he whispered as if afraid of being overheard how are you making it anne_shirley anne_shirley smiled wanly pretty well
i imagine a good deal and that helps to pass the time of course it rather lonesome but then i may as well get used to that
anne_shirley smiled again bravely facing the long year of solitary imprisonment before her matthew_cuthbert recollected that he must say what he had come to say without loss of time lest miss_marilla_cuthbert return prematurely
well now anne_shirley dont you think you better do it and have it over with he whispered it ll have to be done sooner or later you know for miss_marilla_cuthbert a dreadful deter mined woman dreadful determined anne_shirley
do it right off i say and have it over do you mean apologize to mrs_rachel_lynde yes apologize that the very word said matthew_cuthbert eagerly
just smooth it over so to speak that what i was trying to get at i suppose i could do it to oblige you said anne_shirley thoughtfully
it would be true enough to say i am sorry because i am sorry now i wasnt a bit sorry last night
i was mad clear through and i stayed mad all night i know i did because i woke up three time
and i was just furious every time but this morning it was over i wasnt in a temper anymore and it left a dreadful sort of goneness too
i felt so ashamed of myself but i just couldnt think of going and telling mrs_rachel_lynde so it would be so humiliating
i made up my mind i stay shut up here forever rather than do that but still i do anything for you if you really want me to
well now of course i do it terrible lonesome downstairs without you just go and smooth thing over that a good girl
very well said anne_shirley resignedly i ll tell miss_marilla_cuthbert as soon as she comes in i ve repented that right
that right anne_shirley but dont tell miss_marilla_cuthbert i said anything about it she might think i was putting my oar in
and i promised not to do that wild horses wont drag the secret from me promised anne_shirley solemnly how would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow
he fled hastily to the remotest corner of the horse pasture lest miss_marilla_cuthbert should suspect what he had been up to
miss_marilla_cuthbert herself upon her return to the house was agreeably surprised to hear a plaintive voice calling miss_marilla_cuthbert over the banisters
but matthew_cuthbert was gone scared at his own success well she said going into the hall i sorry i lost my temper and said rude thing and i willing to go and tell mrs_rachel_lynde so
very well miss_marilla_cuthbert crispness gave no sign of her relief she had been wondering what under the canopy she should do if anne_shirley did not give in
accordingly after milking behold miss_marilla_cuthbert and anne_shirley walking down the lane the former erect and triumphant the latter drooping and dejected
she lifted her head and stepped lightly along her eye fixed on the sunset sky and an air of subdued exhilaration about her
i ll take you down after milking but halfway down anne_shirley dejection vanished as if by enchantment miss_marilla_cuthbert beheld the change disapprovingly
this was no meek penitent such as it behooved her to take into the presence of the offended mrs_rachel_lynde
what are you thinking of anne_shirley she asked sharply i imagining out what i must say to mrs_rachel_lynde answered anne_shirley dreamily
this was satisfactory or should have been so but miss_marilla_cuthbert could not rid herself of the notion that something in her scheme of punishment was going askew
rapt and radiant anne_shirley continued until they were in the very presence of mrs_rachel_lynde who was sitting knitting by her kitchen window
anne_shirley had no business to look so rapt and radiant then the radiance vanished mournful penitence appeared on every feature before a word was spoken
anne_shirley suddenly went down on her knees before the astonished mrs_rachel_lynde and held out her hand beseechingly oh mrs_rachel_lynde i am so extremely sorry she said with a quiver in her voice
i could never express all my sorrow no not if i used up a whole dictionary you must just imagine it
i behaved terribly to you and i ve disgraced the dear friend matthew_cuthbert and miss_marilla_cuthbert who have let me stay at green gables although i not a boy
i a dreadfully wicked and ungrateful girl and i deserve to be punished and cast out by respectable people forever it was very wicked of me to fly into a temper because you told me the truth
it was the truth every word you said was true my hair is red and i freckled and skinny and ugly
what i said to you was true too but i shouldnt have said it oh mrs_rachel_lynde please please forgive me
if you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow on a poor little orphan girl would you even if she had a dreadful temper
oh i am sure you wouldnt please say you forgive me mrs_rachel_lynde anne_shirley clasped her hand together bowed her head and waited for the word of judgment
there was no mistaking her sincerity it breathed in every tone of her voice both miss_marilla_cuthbert and mrs_rachel_lynde recognized its unmistakable ring
but the former under stood in dismay that anne_shirley was actually enjoying her valley of humiliation was reveling in the thoroughness of her abasement
where was the wholesome punishment upon which she miss_marilla_cuthbert had plumed herself anne_shirley had turned it into a species of positive pleasure
she only perceived that anne_shirley had made a very thorough apology and all resentment vanished from her kindly if somewhat officious heart
good mrs_rachel_lynde not being overburdened with perception did not see this there there get up child she said heartily
of course i forgive you i guess i was a little too hard on you anyway but i such an outspoken person
it cant be denied your hair is terrible red but i knew a girl once went to school with her in fact whose hair was every mite as red as yours when she was young but when she grew up it darkened to a real handsome auburn
you just mustnt mind me that what i wouldnt be a mite surprised if yours did too not a mite oh mrs_rachel_lynde
anne_shirley drew a long breath as she rose to her feet you have given me a hope i shall always feel that you are a benefactor
oh i could endure anything if i only thought my hair would be a handsome auburn when i grew up it would be so much easier to be good if one hair was a handsome auburn dont you think
and now may i go out into your garden and sit on that bench under the apple tree while you and miss_marilla_cuthbert are talking
there is so much more scope for imagination out there laws yes run along child and you can pick a bouquet of them white june lilies over in the corner if you like
as the door closed behind anne_shirley mrs_rachel_lynde got briskly up to light a lamp she a real odd little thing
take this chair miss_marilla_cuthbert it easier than the one you ve got i just keep that for the hired boy to sit on
yes she certainly is an odd child but there is something kind of taking about her after all i dont feel so surprised at you and matthew_cuthbert keeping her as i did nor so sorry for you either
of course she has a queer way of expressing herself a little too well too kind of forcible you know but she ll likely get over that now that she come to live among civilized folks
and then her temper pretty quick i guess but there one comfort a child that has a quick temper just blaze up and cool down aint never likely to be sly or deceitful
she may turn out all right preserve me from a sly child that what on the whole miss_marilla_cuthbert i kind of like her
when miss_marilla_cuthbert went home anne_shirley came out of the fragrant twilight of the orchard with a sheaf of white narcissi in her hand
i apologized pretty well didnt i she said proudly as they went down the lane i thought since i had to do it
i might as well do it thoroughly you did it thoroughly all right enough was miss_marilla_cuthbert comment miss_marilla_cuthbert was dismayed at finding herself inclined to laugh over the recollection
she had also an uneasy feeling that she ought to scold anne_shirley for apologizing so well but then that was ridiculous
she compromised with her conscience by saying severely i hope you wont have occasion to make many more such apologies i hope you ll try to control your temper now anne_shirley
that wouldnt be so hard if people wouldnt twit me about my look said anne_shirley with a sigh i dont get cross about other thing but i so tired of being twitted about my hair
and it just makes me boil right over do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when i grow up
you shouldnt think so much about your look anne_shirley i afraid you are a very vain little girl how can i be vain when i know i homely protested anne_shirley
i love pretty thing and i hate to look in the glass and see something that isnt pretty it makes me feel so sorrowful just as i feel when i look at any ugly thing
i ve had that said to me before but i have my doubts about it remarked skeptical anne_shirley sniffing at her narcissi
i pity it because it isnt beautiful handsome is as handsome does quoted miss_marilla_cuthbert oh arent these flower sweet
it was lovely of mrs_rachel_lynde to give them to me i have no hard feeling against mrs_rachel_lynde now it gives you a lovely comfortable feeling to apologize and be forgiven doesnt it
arent the stars bright tonight if you could live in a star which one would you pick i like that lovely clear big one away over there above that dark hill
anne_shirley do hold your tongue said miss_marilla_cuthbert thoroughly worn out trying to follow the gyrations of anne_shirley thoughts anne_shirley said no more until they turned into their own lane
a little gypsy wind came down it to meet them laden with the spicy perfume of young dew wet ferns far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out through the tree from the kitchen at green gables
anne_shirley suddenly came close to miss_marilla_cuthbert and slipped her hand into the older woman hard palm it lovely to be going home and know it home she said
i love green gables already and i never loved any place before no place ever seemed like home oh miss_marilla_cuthbert i so happy
something warm and pleasant welled up in miss_marilla_cuthbert heart at touch of that thin little hand in her own a throb of the maternity she had missed perhaps
i could pray right now and not find it a bit hard its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed her she hastened to restore her sensations to their normal calm by inculcating a moral
if you ll be a good girl you ll always be happy anne_shirley and you should never find it hard to say your prayer
saying one prayer isnt exactly the same thing as praying said anne_shirley meditatively but i going to imagine that i the wind that is blowing up there in those tree tops
when i get tired of the tree i ll imagine i gently waving down here in the ferns and then i ll fly over to mrs_rachel_lynde garden and set the flower dancing and then i ll go with one great swoop over the clover field and
then i ll blow over the lake of shining waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling waves oh there so much scope for imagination in a wind
so i ll not talk any more just now miss_marilla_cuthbert thanks be to goodness for that breathed miss_marilla_cuthbert in devout relief
chapter xi anne_shirley impressions of sunday school well how do you like them said miss_marilla_cuthbert anne_shirley was standing in the gable room looking solemnly at three new dress spread out on the bed
one was of snuffy colored gingham which miss_marilla_cuthbert had been tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer because it looked so serviceable one was of black and white checkered sateen which she had picked up at a bargain counter in the winter and one was a stiff print of an ugly blue shade which she had purchased that week at a carmody store
she had made them up herself and they were all made alike plain skirts fulled tightly to plain waists with sleeve as plain as waist and skirt and tight as sleeve could be
i ll imagine that i like them said anne_shirley soberly i dont want you to imagine it said miss_marilla_cuthbert offended
oh i can see you dont like the dress what is the matter with them arent they neat and clean and new
yes then why dont you like them they re they re not pretty said anne_shirley reluctantly pretty miss_marilla_cuthbert sniffed i didnt trouble my head about getting pretty dress for you
those dress are good sensible serviceable dress without any frills or furbelows about them and they re all you ll get this summer
i dont believe in pampering vanity anne_shirley i ll tell you that right off the brown gingham and the blue print will do you for school when you begin to go
the sateen is for church and sunday school i ll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear them
i should think you be grateful to get most anything after those skimpy wincey thing you ve been wearing oh i am grateful protested anne_shirley
but i be ever so much gratefuller if if you made just one of them with puffed sleeve puffed sleeve are so fashionable now
it would give me such a thrill miss_marilla_cuthbert just to wear a dress with puffed sleeve well you ll have to do without your thrill
i hadnt any material to waste on puffed sleeve i think they are ridiculous looking thing anyhow i prefer the plain sensible one
but i rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and sensible all by myself persisted anne_shirley mournfully
trust you for that well hang those dress carefully up in your closet and then sit down and learn the sunday school lesson
i got a quarterly from mr_william_bell for you and you ll go to sunday school tomorrow said miss_marilla_cuthbert disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon
anne_shirley clasped her hand and looked at the dress i did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeve she whispered disconsolately
i prayed for one but i didnt much expect it on that account i didnt suppose god would have time to bother about a little orphan girl dress
i knew i just have to depend on miss_marilla_cuthbert for it well fortunately i can imagine that one of them is of snow white muslin with lovely lace frills and three puffed sleeve
the next morning warnings of a sick headache prevented miss_marilla_cuthbert from going to sunday school with anne_shirley you ll have to go down and call for mrs_rachel_lynde anne_shirley she said
she ll see that you get into the right class now mind you behave yourself properly stay to preaching afterwards and ask mrs_rachel_lynde to show you our pew
here a cent for collection dont stare at people and dont fidget i shall expect you to tell me the text when you come home
anne_shirley started off irreproachable arrayed in the stiff black and white sateen which while decent as regards length and certainly not open to the charge of skimpiness contrived to emphasize every corner and angle of her thin figure
her hat was a little flat glossy new sailor the extreme plainness of which had likewise much disappointed anne_shirley who had permitted herself secret visions of ribbon and flower
the latter however were supplied before anne_shirley reached the main road for being confronted halfway down the lane with a golden frenzy of wind stirred buttercups and a glory of wild roses anne_shirley promptly and liberally garlanded her hat with a heavy wreath of them
whatever other people might have thought of the result it satisfied anne_shirley and she tripped gaily down the road holding her ruddy head with its decoration of pink and yellow very proudly
when she had reached mrs_rachel_lynde house she found that lady gone nothing daunted anne_shirley proceeded onward to the church alone
in the porch she found a crowd of little girl all more or less gaily attired in whites and blues and pinks and all staring with curious eye at this stranger in their midst with her extraordinary head adornment
mrs_rachel_lynde said she had an awful temper jerry buote the hired boy at green gables said she talked all the time to herself or to the tree and flower like a crazy girl
avonlea little girl had already heard queer story about anne_shirley they looked at her and whispered to each other behind their quarterlies
nobody made any friendly advances then or later on when the opening exercises were over and anne_shirley found herself in miss rogerson class
her method of teaching was to ask the printed questions from the quarterly and look sternly over its edge at the particular little girl she thought ought to answer the question
she looked very often at anne_shirley and anne_shirley thanks to miss_marilla_cuthbert drilling answered promptly but it may be questioned if she understood very much about either question or answer
she did not think she liked miss rogerson and she felt very miserable every other little girl in the class had puffed sleeve
miss rogerson was a middle aged lady who had taught a sunday school class for twenty year anne_shirley felt that life was really not worth living without puffed sleeve
her wreath having faded anne_shirley had discarded it in the lane so miss_marilla_cuthbert was spared the knowledge of that for a time
well how did you like sunday school miss_marilla_cuthbert wanted to know when anne_shirley came home i didnt like it a bit
anne_shirley sat down on the rocker with a long sigh kissed one of bonny leaves and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia
it was horrid anne_shirley said miss_marilla_cuthbert rebukingly they might have been lonesome while i was away she explained
and now about the sunday school i behaved well just as you told me mrs_rachel_lynde was gone but i went right on myself
i went into the church with a lot of other little girl and i sat in the corner of a pew by the window while the opening exercises went on
mr_william_bell made an awfully long prayer i would have been dreadfully tired before he got through if i hadnt been sitting by that window
but it looked right out on the lake of shining waters so i just gazed at that and imagined all sorts of splendid thing
you shouldnt have done anything of the sort you should have listened to mr_william_bell but he wasnt talking to me protested anne_shirley
he was talking to god and he didnt seem to be very much inter ested in it either i think he thought god was too far off though
there was a long row of white birches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through them way way down deep into the water
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert it was like a beautiful dream it gave me a thrill and i just said thank you for it god two or three time
well mr_william_bell did get through at last and they told me to go into the classroom with miss rogerson class
not out loud i hope said miss_marilla_cuthbert anxiously oh no just under my breath there were nine other girl in it
it was as easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when i was alone in the east gable but it was awfully hard there among the others who had really truly puffs
they all had puffed sleeve i tried to imagine mine were puffed too but i couldnt why couldnt i you shouldnt have been thinking about your sleeve in sunday school
you should have been attending to the lesson i hope you knew it oh yes and i answered a lot of questions
there were lot i wanted to ask her but i didnt like to because i didnt think she was a kindred spirit
miss rogerson asked ever so many i dont think it was fair for her to do all the asking then all the other little girl recited a paraphrase
she asked me if i knew any i told her i didnt but i could recite the dog at his master grave if she liked
it isnt a really truly religious piece of poetry but it so sad and melancholy that it might as well be
that in the third royal reader she said it wouldnt do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next sunday
i read it over in church afterwards and it splendid there are two lines in particular that just thrill me
quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell in midian evil day i dont know what squadrons means nor midian either but it sounds so tragical
i can hardly wait until next sunday to recite it i ll practice it all the week after sunday school i asked miss rogerson because mrs_rachel_lynde was too far away to show me your pew
i sat just as still as i could and the text was revelations third chapter second and third verses it was a very long text
if i was a minister i pick the short snappy one the sermon was awfully long too i suppose the minister had to match it to the text
i didnt think he was a bit interesting the trouble with him seems to be that he hasnt enough imagination i didnt listen to him very much
miss_marilla_cuthbert felt helplessly that all this should be sternly reproved but she was hampered by the undeniable fact that some of the thing anne_shirley had said especially about the minister sermons and mr_william_bell prayer were what she herself had really thought deep down in her heart for year but had never given expression to
it almost seemed to her that those secret unuttered critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible and accusing shape and form in the person of this outspoken morsel of neglected humanity
a solemn vow and promise it was not until the next friday that miss_marilla_cuthbert heard the story of the flower wreathed hat
i just let my thoughts run and i thought of the most surprising thing chapter xii she came home from mrs_rachel_lynde and called anne_shirley to account
anne_shirley mrs_rachel_lynde says you went to church last sunday with your hat rigged out ridiculous with roses and buttercups
what on earth put you up to such a caper a pretty looking object you must have been oh i know pink and yellow
arent becoming to me began anne_shirley becoming fiddlesticks it was putting flower on your hat at all no matter what color they were that was ridiculous
you are the most aggravating child i dont see why it any more ridiculous to wear flower on your hat than on your dress protested anne_shirley
lot of little girl there had bouquets pinned on their dress what the difference miss_marilla_cuthbert was not to be drawn from the safe concrete into dubious paths of the abstract
dont answer me back like that anne_shirley it was very silly of you to do such a thing never let me catch you at such a trick again
mrs_rachel_lynde says she thought she would sink through the floor when she saw you come in all rigged out like that
she couldnt get near enough to tell you to take them off till it was too late she says people talked about it something dreadful
of course they would think i had no better sense than to let you go decked out like that oh i so sorry said anne_shirley tear welling into her eye
i never thought you mind the roses and buttercups were so sweet and pretty i thought they look lovely on my hat
lot of the little girl had artificial flower on their hats i afraid i going to be a dreadful trial to you
that would be terrible i dont think i could endure it most likely i would go into consumption i so thin as it is you see
maybe you better send me back to the asylum but that would be better than being a trial to you nonsense said miss_marilla_cuthbert vexed at herself for having made the child cry
i dont want to send you back to the asylum i sure all i want is that you should behave like other little girl and not make yourself ridiculous
i going up to see if i can borrow a skirt pattern from mrs diana_barry and if you like you can come with me and get acquainted with diana_barry
anne_shirley rose to her feet with clasped hand the tear still glistening on her cheeks the dish towel she had been hemming slipped unheeded to the floor
dont cry any more i ve got some news for you diana_barry came home this afternoon oh miss_marilla_cuthbert i frightened now that it has come
i actually frightened what if she shouldnt like me it would be the most tragical disappointment of my life now dont get into a fluster
and i do wish you wouldnt use such long word it sounds so funny in a little girl i guess diana_barry ll like you well enough
it her mother you ve got to reckon with if she doesnt like you it wont matter how much diana_barry does if she has heard about your outburst to mrs_rachel_lynde and going to church with buttercups round your hat
i dont know what she ll think of you you must be polite and well behaved and dont make any of your startling speeches
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert you be excited too if you were going to meet a little girl you hoped to be your bosom friend and
for pity sake if the child isnt actually trembling anne_shirley was trembling her face was pale and tense whose mother mightnt like you she said as she hastened to get her hat
they went over to orchard slope by the short cut across the brook and up the firry hill grove mrs diana_barry came to the kitchen door in answer to miss_marilla_cuthbert knock
she was a tall black eyed black haired woman with a very resolute mouth she had the reputation of being very strict with her child
how do you do miss_marilla_cuthbert she said cordially come in and this is the little girl you have adopted i suppose
spelled with an gasped anne_shirley who tremulous and excited as she was was determined there should be no misunderstanding on that important point
yes this is anne_shirley said miss_marilla_cuthbert mrs diana_barry not hearing or not comprehending merely shook hand and said kindly how are you
i am well in body although considerable rumpled up in spirit thank you ma am said anne_shirley gravely then aside to miss_marilla_cuthbert in an audible whisper there wasnt anything startling in that was there miss_marilla_cuthbert
she was a very pretty little girl with her mother black eye and hair and rosy cheeks and the merry expression which was her inheritance from her father
diana_barry was sitting on the sofa reading a book which she dropped when the callers entered this is my little girl diana_barry said mrs diana_barry
diana_barry you might take anne_shirley out into the garden and show her your flower it will be better for you than straining your eye over that book
she reads entirely too much this to miss_marilla_cuthbert as the little girl went out and i cant prevent her for her father aids and abets her
she always poring over a book i glad she has the prospect of a playmate perhaps it will take her more out of door
outside in the garden which was full of mellow sunset light streaming through the dark old firs to the west of it stood anne_shirley and diana_barry gazing bashfully at each other over a clump of gorgeous tiger lilies
the diana_barry garden was a bowery wilderness of flower which would have delighted anne_shirley heart at any time less fraught with destiny
prim right angled paths neatly bordered with clamshells intersected it like moist red ribbons and in the bed between old fashioned flower ran riot
there were rosy bleeding heart and great splendid crimson peonies white fragrant narcissi and thorny sweet scotch roses pink and blue and white columbines and lilac tinted bouncing bets clumps of southernwood and ribbon grass and mint purple adam and eve daffodils and masses of sweet clover white with its delicate fragrant feathery sprays scarlet lightning that shot its fiery lances over prim white musk flower a garden it was where sunshine lingered and bees hummed and winds beguiled into loitering purred and rustled
oh diana_barry said anne_shirley at last clasping her hand and speaking almost in a whisper oh do you think you can like me a little enough to be my bosom friend
it was encircled by huge old willows and tall firs beneath which flourished flower that loved the shade
diana_barry laughed diana_barry always laughed before she spoke why i guess so she said frankly i awfully glad you ve come to live at green gables
it will be jolly to have somebody to play with there isnt any other girl who life near enough to play with and i ve no sisters big enough
will you swear to be my friend forever and ever demanded anne_shirley eagerly diana_barry looked shocked why it dreadfully wicked to swear she said rebukingly
oh no not my kind of swearing there are two kinds you know i never heard of but one kind said diana_barry doubtfully
there really is another oh it isnt wicked at all it just means vowing and promising solemnly well i dont mind doing that agreed diana_barry relieved
how do you do it we must join hand so said anne_shirley gravely it ought to be over running water
i solemnly swear to be faithful to my bosom friend diana_barry as long as the sun and moon shall endure
we ll just imagine this path is running water i ll repeat the oath first now you say it and put my name in
diana_barry repeated the oath with a laugh fore and aft then she said you re a queer girl anne_shirley i heard before that you were queer
but i believe i going to like you real well when miss_marilla_cuthbert and anne_shirley went home diana_barry went with them as far as the log bridge
the two little girl walked with their arms about each other at the brook they parted with many promises to spend the next afternoon together
well did you find diana_barry a kindred spirit asked miss_marilla_cuthbert as they went up through the garden of green gables
oh yes sighed anne_shirley blissfully unconscious of any sarcasm on miss_marilla_cuthbert part oh miss_marilla_cuthbert i the happiest girl on prince edward island this very moment
i assure you i ll say my prayer with a right good will tonight diana_barry and i are going to build a playhouse in mr_william_bell birch grove tomorrow
can i have those broken pieces of china that are out in the woodshed diana_barry birthday is in february and mine is in march
dont you think that is a very strange coincidence diana_barry is going to lend me a book to read she says it perfectly splendid and tremendously exciting
she going to show me a place back in the wood where rice lilies grow dont you think diana_barry has got very soulful eye
i wish i had soulful eye diana_barry is going to teach me to sing a song called nelly in the hazel dell
she going to give me a picture to put up in my room it a perfectly beautiful picture she says a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress
a sewing machine agent gave it to her i wish i had something to give diana_barry i an inch taller than diana_barry but she is ever so much fatter
she says she like to be thin because it so much more graceful but i afraid she only said it to soothe my feeling
we re going to the shore some day to gather shells we have agreed to call the spring down by the log bridge the dryad bubble
isnt that a perfectly elegant name i read a story once about a spring called that a dryad is sort of a grown up fairy i think
well all i hope is you wont talk diana_barry to death said miss_marilla_cuthbert but remember this in all your planning anne_shirley
you re not going to play all the time nor most of it you ll have your work to do and it ll have to be done first
he had just got home from a trip to the store at carmody and he sheepishly produced a small parcel from his pocket and handed it to anne_shirley with a deprecatory look at miss_marilla_cuthbert
anne_shirley cup of happiness was full and matthew_cuthbert caused it to overflow i heard you say you liked chocolate sweeties so i got you some he said
humph sniffed miss_marilla_cuthbert it ll ruin her teeth and stomach there there child dont look so dismal you can eat those since matthew_cuthbert has gone and got them
he better have brought you peppermints they re wholesomer dont sicken yourself eating all them at once now oh no indeed i wont said anne_shirley eagerly
i ll just eat one tonight miss_marilla_cuthbert and i can give diana_barry half of them cant i the other half will taste twice as sweet to me if i give some to her
it delightful to think i have something to give her i will say it for the child said miss_marilla_cuthbert when anne_shirley had gone to her gable she isnt stingy
i glad for of all faults i detest stinginess in a child dear me it only three week since she came and it seems as if she been here always
i cant imagine the place without her now dont be looking i told you so matthew_cuthbert that bad enough in a woman but it isnt to be endured in a man
i perfectly willing to own up that i glad i consented to keep the child and that i getting fond of her but dont you rub it in matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert
the delights of anticipation it time anne_shirley was in to do her sewing said miss_marilla_cuthbert glancing at the clock and then out into the yellow august afternoon where everything drowsed in the heat
i gave her leave to and now she perched out there on the woodpile talking to matthew_cuthbert nineteen to the dozen when she knows perfectly well she ought to be at her work
chapter xiii she stayed playing with diana_barry more than half an hour more and of course he listening to her like a perfect ninny
i never saw such an infatuated man the more she talks and the odder the thing she says the more he delighted evidently
a series of staccato taps on the west window brought anne_shirley flying in from the yard eye shining cheeks faintly flushed with pink unbraided hair streaming behind her in a torrent of brightness
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert she exclaimed breathlessly there going to be a sunday school picnic next week in mr harmon andrews field right near the lake of shining waters
anne_shirley you come right in here this minute do you hear me and mrs superintendent mr_william_bell and mrs_rachel_lynde are going to make ice cream think of it miss_marilla_cuthbert ice cream
and oh miss_marilla_cuthbert can i go to it just look at the clock if you please anne_shirley what time did i tell you to come in
two clock but isnt it splendid about the picnic miss_marilla_cuthbert please can i go oh i ve never been to a picnic i ve dreamed of picnic but i ve never
yes i told you to come at two clock and it a quarter to three i like to know why you didnt obey me anne_shirley
why i meant to miss_marilla_cuthbert as much as could be but you have no idea how fascinating idlewild is and then of course i had to tell matthew_cuthbert about the picnic
matthew_cuthbert is such a sympathetic listener please can i go you ll have to learn to resist the fascination of idle whatever you call it
when i tell you to come in at a certain time i mean that time and not half an hour later
and you neednt stop to discourse with sympathetic listeners on your way either as for the picnic of course you can go
you re a sunday school scholar and it not likely i refuse to let you go when all the other little girl are going
but but faltered anne_shirley diana_barry says that everybody must take a basket of thing to eat i cant cook as you know miss_marilla_cuthbert and
and i dont mind going to a picnic without puffed sleeve so much but i feel terribly humiliated if i had to go without a basket
it been preying on my mind ever since diana_barry told me well it neednt prey any longer i ll bake you a basket
oh you dear good miss_marilla_cuthbert oh you are so kind to me oh i so much obliged to you
getting through with her ohs anne_shirley cast herself into miss_marilla_cuthbert arms and rapturously kissed her sallow cheek it was the first time in her whole life that childish lips had voluntarily touched miss_marilla_cuthbert face
she was secretly vastly pleased at anne_shirley impulsive caress which was probably the reason why she said brusquely there there never mind your kissing nonsense
again that sudden sensation of startling sweetness thrilled her i sooner see you doing strictly as you re told as for cooking i mean to begin giving you lesson in that some of these day
but you re so featherbrained anne_shirley i ve been waiting to see if you sober down a little and learn to be steady before i begin
you ve got to keep your wits about you in cooking and not stop in the middle of thing to let your thoughts rove all over creation
i do not like patchwork said anne_shirley dolefully hunting out her workbasket and sitting down before a little heap of red and white diamonds with a sigh
now get out your patchwork and have your square done before teatime i think some kinds of sewing would be nice but there no scope for imagination in patchwork
but of course i rather be anne_shirley of green gables sewing patchwork than anne_shirley of any other place with nothing to do but play
it just one little seam after another and you never seem to be getting anywhere i wish time went as quick sewing patches as it does when i playing with diana_barry though
oh we do have such elegant time miss_marilla_cuthbert i have to furnish most of the imagination but i well able to do that
diana_barry is simply perfect in every other way you know that little piece of land across the brook that runs up between our farm and mr diana_barry
it belongs to mr_william_bell and right in the corner there is a little ring of white birch tree the most romantic spot miss_marilla_cuthbert
diana_barry and i have our playhouse there we call it idlewild isnt that a poetical name i assure you it took me some time to think it out
i stayed awake nearly a whole night before i invented it then just as i was dropping off to sleep it came like an inspiration
diana_barry was enraptured when she heard it we have got our house fixed up elegantly you must come and see it miss_marilla_cuthbert wont you
we have great big stones all covered with moss for seats and boards from tree to tree for shelves and we have all our dishes on them
of course they re all broken but it the easiest thing in the world to imagine that they are whole there a piece of a plate with a spray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful
we keep it in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there too the fairy glass is as lovely as a dream
diana_barry found it out in the wood behind their chicken house it all full of rainbows just little young rainbows that havent grown big yet and
but it nice to imagine the fairies lost it one night when they had a ball so we call it the fairy glass
diana_barry mother told her it was broken off a hanging lamp they once had matthew_cuthbert is going to make us a table
oh we have named that little round pool over in mr diana_barry field willowmere i got that name out of the book diana_barry lent me
that was a thrilling book miss_marilla_cuthbert the heroine had five lovers i be satisfied with one wouldnt you she was very handsome and she went through great tribulations
she could faint as easy as anything i love to be able to faint wouldnt you miss_marilla_cuthbert it so romantic but i really very healthy for all
i so thin i believe i getting fatter though dont you think i am i look at my elbows every morning when i get up to see if any dimples are coming
diana_barry is having a new dress made with elbow sleeve she is going to wear it to the picnic oh i do hope it will be fine next wednesday
i dont feel that i could endure the disappointment if anything happened to prevent me from getting to the picnic i suppose i live through it but i certain it would be a lifelong sorrow
it wouldnt matter if i got to a hundred picnic in after year they wouldnt make up for missing this one
they re going to have boats on the lake of shining waters and ice cream as i told you i have never tasted ice cream
diana_barry tried to explain what it was like but i guess ice cream is one of those thing that are beyond imagination
anne_shirley you have talked even on for ten minute by the clock said miss_marilla_cuthbert now just for curiosity sake see if you can hold your tongue for the same length of time
anne_shirley held her tongue as desired but for the rest of the week she talked picnic and thought picnic and dreamed picnic
on saturday it rained and she worked herself up into such a frantic state lest it should keep on raining until and over wednesday that miss_marilla_cuthbert made her sew an extra patchwork square by way of steadying her nerves
on sunday anne_shirley confided to miss_marilla_cuthbert on the way home from church that she grew actually cold all over with excitement when the minister announced the picnic from the pulpit
such a thrill as went up and down my back miss_marilla_cuthbert i dont think i ever really believed until then that there was honestly going to be a picnic
i couldnt help fearing i only imagined it but when a minister says a thing in the pulpit you just have to believe it
you set your heart too much on thing anne_shirley said miss_marilla_cuthbert with a sigh i afraid there ll be a great many disappointments in store for you through life
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert looking forward to thing is half the pleasure of them exclaimed anne_shirley you maynt get the thing themselves but nothing can prevent you from having the fun of looking forward to them
mrs_rachel_lynde says blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not be disappointed but i think it would be worse to expect nothing than to be disappointed
miss_marilla_cuthbert wore her amethyst brooch to church that day as usual miss_marilla_cuthbert always wore her amethyst brooch to church she would have thought it rather sacrilegious to leave it off as bad as forgetting her bible or her collection dime
that amethyst brooch was miss_marilla_cuthbert most treasured possession a seafaring uncle had given it to her mother who in turn had bequeathed it to miss_marilla_cuthbert
miss_marilla_cuthbert knew too little about precious stones to realize how fine the amethysts actually were but she thought them very beautiful and was always pleasantly conscious of their violet shimmer at her throat above her good brown satin dress even although she could not see it
it was an old fashioned oval containing a braid of her mother hair surrounded by a border of very fine amethysts anne_shirley had been smitten with delighted admiration when she first saw that brooch
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert it a perfectly elegant brooch i dont know how you can pay attention to the sermon or the prayer when you have it on
long ago before i had ever seen a diamond i read about them and i tried to imagine what they would be like
i couldnt i know i think amethysts are just sweet they are what i used to think diamonds were like i thought they would be lovely glimmering purple stones
when i saw a real diamond in a lady ring one day i was so disappointed i cried of course it was very lovely but it wasnt my idea of a diamond
will you let me hold the brooch for one minute miss_marilla_cuthbert do you think amethysts can be the souls of good violets
chapter xiv anne_shirley confession on the monday evening before the picnic miss_marilla_cuthbert came down from her room with a troubled face
anne_shirley she said to that small personage who was shelling peas by the spotless table and singing nelly of the hazel dell with a vigor and expression that did credit to diana_barry teaching did you see anything of my amethyst brooch
i thought i stuck it in my pincushion when i came home from church yesterday evening but i cant find it anywhere
i i saw it this afternoon when you were away at the aid society said anne_shirley a little slowly
i was passing your door when i saw it on the cushion so i went in to look at it
admitted anne_shirley i took it up and i pinned it on my breast just to see how it would look
did you touch it said miss_marilla_cuthbert sternly e s you had no business to do anything of the sort it very wrong in a little girl to meddle
you shouldnt have gone into my room in the first place and you shouldnt have touched a brooch that didnt belong to you in the second
where did you put it oh i put it back on the bureau i hadnt it on a minute truly i didnt mean to meddle miss_marilla_cuthbert
i didnt think about its being wrong to go in and try on the brooch but i see now that it was and i ll never do it again
that one good thing about me i never do the same naughty thing twice you didnt put it back said miss_marilla_cuthbert
that brooch isnt anywhere on the bureau you ve taken it out or something anne_shirley i did put it back said anne_shirley quickly pertly miss_marilla_cuthbert thought
i dont just remember whether i stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in the china tray but i perfectly certain
i put it back i ll go and have another look said miss_marilla_cuthbert determining to be just if you put that brooch back it there still
if it isnt i ll know you didnt that all miss_marilla_cuthbert went to her room and made a thorough search not only over the bureau but in every other place
she thought the brooch might possibly be it was not to be found and she returned to the kitchen anne_shirley the brooch is gone
by your own admission you were the last person to handle it now what have you done with it tell me the truth at once
did you take it out and lose it no i didnt said anne_shirley solemnly meeting miss_marilla_cuthbert angry gaze squarely
i never took the brooch out of your room and that is the truth if i was to be led to the block for it although i not very certain what a block is
so there miss_marilla_cuthbert anne_shirley so there was only intended to emphasize her assertion but miss_marilla_cuthbert took it as a display of defiance
i believe you are telling me a falsehood anne_shirley she said sharply i know you are there now dont say anything more unless you are prepared to tell the whole truth
go to your room and stay there until you are ready to confess will i take the peas with me said anne_shirley meekly
no i ll finish shelling them myself do as i bid you when anne_shirley had gone miss_marilla_cuthbert went about her evening tasks in a very disturbed state of mind
she was worried about her valuable brooch what if anne_shirley had lost it and how wicked of the child to deny having taken it when anybody could see she must have
with such an innocent face too i dont know what i wouldnt sooner have had happen thought miss_marilla_cuthbert as she nervously shelled the peas
of course i dont suppose she meant to steal it or anything like that she just taken it to play with or help along that imagination of hers
she must have taken it that clear for there hasnt been a soul in that room since she was in it by her own story until i went up tonight
and the brooch is gone there nothing surer i suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for fear she ll be punished
it a dreadful thing to think she tells falsehoods it a far worse thing than her fit of temper it a fearful responsibility to have a child in your house you cant trust
slyness and untruthfulness that what she has displayed i declare i feel worse about that than about the brooch if she only have told the truth about it i wouldnt mind so much
miss_marilla_cuthbert went to her room at intervals all through the evening and searched for the brooch without finding it a bedtime visit to the east gable produced no result
anne_shirley persisted in denying that she knew anything about the brooch but miss_marilla_cuthbert was only the more firmly convinced that she did
she told matthew_cuthbert the story the next morning matthew_cuthbert was confounded and puzzled he could not so quickly lose faith in anne_shirley
but he had to admit that circumstances were against her you re sure it hasnt fell down behind the bureau was the only suggestion he could offer
i ve moved the bureau and i ve taken out the drawers and i ve looked in every crack and cranny was miss_marilla_cuthbert positive answer
the brooch is gone and that child has taken it and lied about it that the plain ugly truth matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert and
we might as well look it in the face well now what are you going to do about it matthew_cuthbert asked forlornly feeling secretly thankful that miss_marilla_cuthbert and not he had to deal with the situation
she ll stay in her room until she confesses said miss_marilla_cuthbert grimly remembering the success of this method in the former case
perhaps we ll be able to find the brooch if she ll only tell where she took it but in any case she ll have to be severely punished matthew_cuthbert
he felt no desire to put his oar in this time then we ll see well now you ll have to punish her said matthew_cuthbert reaching for his hat
i ve nothing to do with it remember you warned me off yourself miss_marilla_cuthbert felt deserted by everyone she could not even go to mrs_rachel_lynde for advice
she went up to the east gable with a very serious face and left it with a face more serious still
anne_shirley steadfastly refused to confess she persisted in asserting that she had not taken the brooch the child had evidently been crying and miss_marilla_cuthbert felt a pang of pity which she sternly repressed
by night she was as she expressed it beat out you ll stay in this room until you confess anne_shirley you can make up your mind to that she said firmly
but the picnic is tomorrow miss_marilla_cuthbert cried anne_shirley you wont keep me from going to that will you you ll just let me out for the afternoon wont you
then i ll stay here as long as you like afterwards cheerfully but i must go to the picnic you ll not go to picnic nor anywhere else until you ve confessed anne_shirley
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert gasped anne_shirley but miss_marilla_cuthbert had gone out and shut the door wednesday morning dawned as bright and fair as if expressly made to order for the picnic
birds sang around green gables the madonna lilies in the garden sent out whiffs of perfume that entered in on viewless winds at every door and window and wandered through hall and room like spirit of benediction
the birches in the hollow waved joyful hand as if watching for anne_shirley usual morning greeting from the east gable but anne_shirley was not at her window
when miss_marilla_cuthbert took her breakfast up to her she found the child sitting primly on her bed pale and resolute with tight shut lips and gleaming eye
miss_marilla_cuthbert i ready to confess ah miss_marilla_cuthbert laid down her tray once again her method had succeeded but her success was very bitter to her
let me hear what you have to say then anne_shirley i took the amethyst brooch said anne_shirley as if repeating a lesson she had learned
but it did look so beautiful miss_marilla_cuthbert when i pinned it on my breast that i was overcome by an irresistible temptation
i took it just as you said i didnt mean to take it when i went in i imagined how perfectly thrilling it would be to take it to idlewild and play
it would be so much easier to imagine i was the lady_cordelia_fitzgerald if i had a real amethyst brooch on
i was the lady_cordelia_fitzgerald diana_barry and i make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts so i took the brooch
i thought i could put it back before you came home i went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the time
when i was going over the bridge across the lake of shining waters i took the brooch off to have another look at it
and then when i was leaning over the bridge it just slipped through my fingers so and went down down down all purply sparkling and sank forevermore beneath the lake of shining waters
oh how it did shine in the sunlight and that the best i can do at confessing miss_marilla_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert felt hot anger surge up into her heart again
this child had taken and lost her treasured amethyst brooch and now sat there calmly reciting the details thereof without the least apparent compunction or repentance
anne_shirley this is terrible she said trying to speak calmly you are the very wickedest girl i ever heard of
yes i suppose i am agreed anne_shirley tranquilly and i know i ll have to be punished it ll be your duty to punish me miss_marilla_cuthbert
wont you please get it over right off because i like to go to the picnic with nothing on my mind
picnic indeed you ll go to no picnic today anne_shirley that shall be your punishment and it isnt half severe enough either for what you ve done
not go to the picnic anne_shirley sprang to her feet and clutched miss_marilla_cuthbert hand but you promised me i might
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert i must go to the picnic that was why i confessed punish me any way you like but that
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert please please let me go to the picnic think of the ice cream for anything you know i may never have a chance to taste ice cream again
miss_marilla_cuthbert disengaged anne_shirley clinging hand stonily you neednt plead anne_shirley you are not going to the picnic and that final
she clasped her hand together gave a piercing shriek and then flung herself face downward on the bed crying and writhing in an utter abandonment of disappointment and despair
no not a word anne_shirley realized that miss_marilla_cuthbert was not to be moved for the land sake gasped miss_marilla_cuthbert hastening from the room
i believe the child is crazy no child in her senses would behave as she does if she isnt she utterly bad
oh dear i afraid mrs_rachel_lynde was right from the first but i ve put my hand to the plow and i wont look back
that was a dismal morning miss_marilla_cuthbert worked fiercely and scrubbed the porch floor and the dairy shelves when she could find nothing else to do
neither the shelves nor the porch needed it but miss_marilla_cuthbert did then she went out and raked the yard when dinner was ready she went to the stairs and called anne_shirley
a tear stained face appeared looking tragically over the banisters come down to your dinner anne_shirley i dont want any dinner miss_marilla_cuthbert said anne_shirley sobbingly
i couldnt eat anything my heart is broken you ll feel remorse of conscience someday i expect for breaking it miss_marilla_cuthbert but i forgive you
remember when the time comes that i forgive you but please dont ask me to eat anything especially boiled pork and greens
exasperated miss_marilla_cuthbert returned to the kitchen and poured out her tale of woe to matthew_cuthbert who between his sense of justice and his unlawful sympathy with anne_shirley was a miserable man
well now she shouldnt have taken the brooch miss_marilla_cuthbert or told story about it he admitted mournfully surveying his plateful of unromantic pork and greens as if he like anne_shirley thought it a food unsuited to crises of feeling but she such a little thing such an interesting little thing
boiled pork and greens are so unromantic when one is in affliction dont you think it pretty rough not to let her go to the picnic when she so set on it
matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert i amazed at you i think i ve let her off entirely too easy and she doesnt appear to realize how wicked she been at all that what worries me most
and you dont seem to realize it neither you re making excuses for her all the time to yourself i can see that
if she really felt sorry it wouldnt be so bad well now she such a little thing feebly reiterated matthew_cuthbert
and there should be allowances made miss_marilla_cuthbert you know she never had any bringing up well she having it now retorted miss_marilla_cuthbert
the only cheerful thing about it was jerry buote the hired boy and miss_marilla_cuthbert resented his cheerfulness as a personal insult
when her dishes were washed and her bread sponge set and her hens fed miss_marilla_cuthbert remembered that she had noticed a small rent in her best black lace shawl when she had taken it off on monday afternoon on returning from the lady aid
the retort silenced matthew_cuthbert if it did not convince him that dinner was a very dismal meal she would go and mend it
as miss_marilla_cuthbert lifted it out the sunlight falling through the vines that clustered thickly about the window struck upon something caught in the shawl something that glittered and sparkled in facets of violet light
the shawl was in a box in her trunk miss_marilla_cuthbert snatched at it with a gasp it was the amethyst brooch hanging to a thread of the lace by its catch
dear life and heart said miss_marilla_cuthbert blankly what does this mean here my brooch safe and sound that i thought was at the bottom of diana_barry pond
whatever did that girl mean by saying she took it and lost it i declare i believe green gables is bewitched
i remember now that when i took off my shawl monday afternoon i laid it on the bureau for a minute
i suppose the brooch got caught in it somehow well miss_marilla_cuthbert betook herself to the east gable brooch in hand anne_shirley had cried herself out and was sitting dejectedly by the window
anne_shirley said miss_marilla_cuthbert solemnly i ve just found my brooch hanging to my black lace shawl now i want to know what that rigmarole you told me this morning meant
why you said you keep me here until i confessed returned anne_shirley wearily and so i decided to confess because i was bound to get to the picnic
i thought out a confession last night after i went to bed and made it as interesting as i could
and i said it over and over so that i wouldnt forget it but you wouldnt let me go to the picnic after all so all my trouble was wasted
miss_marilla_cuthbert had to laugh in spite of herself but her conscience pricked her anne_shirley you do beat all but i was wrong i see that now
of course it wasnt right for you to confess to a thing you hadnt done it was very wrong to do so
i shouldnt have doubted your word when i never known you to tell a story but i drove you to it
so if you ll forgive me anne_shirley i ll forgive you and we ll start square again and now get yourself ready for the picnic
anne_shirley flew up like a rocket oh miss_marilla_cuthbert isnt it too late no it only two clock they wont be more than well gathered yet
and it ll be an hour before they have tea wash your face and comb your hair and put on your gingham
i ll fill a basket for you there plenty of stuff baked in the house and i ll get jerry to hitch up the sorrel and drive you down to the picnic ground
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert exclaimed anne_shirley flying to the washstand five minute ago i was so miserable i was wishing i never been born and now i wouldnt change place with an angel
that night a thoroughly happy completely tired out anne_shirley returned to green gables in a state of beatification impossible to describe
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert i ve had a perfectly scrumptious time scrumptious is a new word i learned today i heard mary alice mr_william_bell use it
we had a splendid tea and then mr harmon andrews took us all for a row on the lake of shining waters six of us at a time
she was leaning out to pick water lilies and if mr andrews hadnt caught her by her sash just in the nick of time she fallen in and prob ly been drowned
isnt it very expressive everything was lovely and jane_andrews nearly fell overboard i wish it had been me it would have been such a romantic experience to have been nearly drowned
it would be such a thrilling tale to tell and we had the ice cream word fail me to describe that ice cream
miss_marilla_cuthbert i assure you it was sublime that evening miss_marilla_cuthbert told the whole story to matthew_cuthbert over her stocking basket
i have to laugh when i think of anne_shirley confession although i suppose i shouldnt for it really was a falsehood
i willing to own up that i made a mistake she concluded candidly but i ve learned a lesson but it doesnt seem as bad as the other would have been somehow and anyhow i responsible for it
that child is hard to understand in some respects but i believe she ll turn out all right yet and there one thing certain no house will ever be dull that she in
chapter xv a tempest in the school teapot what a splendid day said anne_shirley drawing a long breath isnt it good just to be alive on a day like this
i pity the people who arent born yet for missing it they may have good day of course but they can never have this one
it a lot nicer than going round by the road that is so dusty and hot said diana_barry practically peeping into her dinner basket and mentally calculating if the three juicy toothsome raspberry tarts reposing there were divided among ten girl how many bites each girl would have
the little girl of avonlea school always pooled their lunches and to eat three raspberry tarts all alone or even to share them only with one best chum would have forever and ever branded as awful mean the girl who did it
and it splendider still to have such a lovely way to go to school by isnt it and yet when the tarts were divided among ten girl you just got enough to tantalize you
the way anne_shirley and diana_barry went to school was a pretty one anne_shirley thought those walks to and from school with diana_barry couldnt be improved upon even by imagination
going around by the main road would have been so unromantic but to go by lover lane and willowmere and violet vale and the birch path
lover lane opened out below the orchard at green gables and stretched far up into the wood to the end of the miss_marilla_cuthbert farm
it was the way by which the cows were taken to the back pasture and the wood hauled home in winter
was romantic if ever anything was anne_shirley had named it lover lane before she had been a month at green gables
not that lovers ever really walk there she explained to miss_marilla_cuthbert but diana_barry and i are reading a perfectly magnificent book
and there a lover lane in it so we want to have one too and it a very pretty name dont you think
so romantic we cant imagine the lovers into it you know i like that lane because you can think out loud there without people calling you crazy
here diana_barry met her and the two little girl went on up the lane under the leafy arch of maples maples are such sociable tree said anne_shirley they re always rustling and whispering to you until
anne_shirley starting out alone in the morning went down lover lane as far as the brook they came to a rustic bridge
then they left the lane and walked through mr diana_barry back field and past willowmere beyond willowmere came violet vale a little green dimple in the shadow of mr andrew mr_william_bell big wood
of course there are no violets there now anne_shirley told miss_marilla_cuthbert but diana_barry says there are millions of them in spring
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert cant you just imagine you see them it actually takes away my breath i named it violet vale
diana_barry says she never saw the beat of me for hitting on fancy name for place it nice to be clever at something isnt it
she wanted to so i let her but i sure i could have found something more poetical than plain birch path
but diana_barry named the birch path anybody can think of a name like that but the birch path is one of the prettiest place in the world miss_marilla_cuthbert
it was a little narrow twisting path winding down over a long hill straight through mr_william_bell wood where the light came down sifted through so many emerald screens that it was as flawless as the heart of a diamond
it was fringed in all its length with slim young birches white stemmed and lissom boughed ferns and starflowers and wild lilies of the valley and scarlet tufts of pigeonberries grew thickly along it and always there was a delightful spiciness in the air and music of bird calls and the murmur and laugh of wood winds in the tree overhead
now and then you might see a rabbit skipping across the road if you were quiet which with anne_shirley and diana_barry happened about once in a blue moon
down in the valley the path came out to the main road and then it was just up the spruce hill to the school
the avonlea school was a whitewashed building low in the eaves and wide in the window furnished inside with comfortable substantial old fashioned desks that opened and shut and were carved all over their lids with the initials and hieroglyphics of three generations of school child
the schoolhouse was set back from the road and behind it was a dusky fir wood and a brook where all the child put their bottles of milk in the morning to keep cool and sweet until dinner hour
it was other people besides anne_shirley thought so when they stumbled on it miss_marilla_cuthbert had seen anne_shirley start off to school on the first day of september with many secret misgivings
anne_shirley was such an odd girl how would she get on with the other child and how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hour
thing went better than miss_marilla_cuthbert feared however anne_shirley came home that evening in high spirit i think i going to like school here she announced
i dont think much of the master through he all the time curling his mustache and making eye at prissy_andrews
prissy_andrews is grown up you know she sixteen and she studying for the entrance examination into queen academy at charlottetown next year
tillie boulter says the master is dead gone on her she got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair and she does it up so elegantly
she sits in the long seat at the back and he sits there too most of the time to explain her lesson he says
but ruby_gillis says she saw him writing something on her slate and when prissy_andrews read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled and ruby_gillis says she doesnt believe it had anything to do with the lesson
anne_shirley dont let me hear you talking about your teacher in that way again said miss_marilla_cuthbert sharply you dont go to school to criticize the master
i guess he can teach you something and it your business to learn and i want you to understand right off that you are not to come home telling tales about him
that is something i wont encourage i hope you were a good girl indeed i was said anne_shirley comfortably
it wasnt so hard as you might imagine either i sit with diana_barry our seat is right by the window and we can look down to the lake of shining waters
there are a lot of nice girl in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime it so nice to have a lot of little girl to play with
but of course i like diana_barry best and always will i adore diana_barry i dreadfully far behind the others they re all in the fifth book
and i only in the fourth i feel that it kind of a disgrace but there not one of them has such an imagination as i have and i soon found that out
mr_phillips said my spelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could see it all marked over
we had reading and geography and canadian history and dictation today i felt so mortified miss_marilla_cuthbert he might have been politer to a stranger i think
ruby_gillis gave me an apple and sophia sloane lent me a lovely pink card with may i see you home on it
i to give it back to her tomorrow and tillie boulter let me wear her bead ring all the afternoon can i have some of those pearl beads off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring
and oh miss_marilla_cuthbert jane_andrews told me that minnie macpherson told her that she heard prissy_andrews tell sara ruby_gillis that i had a very pretty nose
miss_marilla_cuthbert that is the first compliment i have ever had in my life and you cant imagine what a strange feeling it gave me
miss_marilla_cuthbert have i really a pretty nose i know you ll tell me the truth your nose is well enough said miss_marilla_cuthbert shortly
secretly she thought anne_shirley nose was a remarkable pretty one but she had no intention of telling her so that was three week ago and all had gone smoothly so far
and now this crisp september morning anne_shirley and diana_barry were tripping blithely down the birch path two of the happiest little girl in avonlea
i guess gilbert_blythe will be in school today said diana_barry he been visiting his cousins over in new brunswick all summer and he only came home saturday night
he aw fly handsome anne_shirley and he teases the girl something terrible he just torments our life out diana_barry voice indicated that she rather liked having her life tormented out than not
gilbert_blythe said anne_shirley isnt his name that written up on the porch wall with julia mr_william_bell and a big take notice over them
yes said diana_barry tossing her head but i sure he doesnt like julia mr_william_bell so very much i ve heard him say he studied the multiplication table by her freckles
oh dont speak about freckles to me implored anne_shirley it isnt delicate when i ve got so many but i do think that writing take notices up on the wall about the boy and girl is the silliest ever
i should just like to see anybody dare to write my name up with a boy not of course she hastened to add that anybody would
anne_shirley sighed she didnt want her name written up but it was a little humiliating to know that there was no danger of it
nonsense said diana_barry whose black eye and glossy tresses had played such havoc with the heart of avonlea schoolboys that her name figured on the porch walls in half a dozen take notices
it only meant as a joke and dont you be too sure your name wont ever be written up
charlie_sloane is dead gone on you he told his mother his mother mind you that you were the smartest girl in school
that better than being good looking no it isnt said anne_shirley feminine to the core i rather be pretty than clever
and i hate charlie_sloane i cant bear a boy with goggle eye if anyone wrote my name up with his i never get over it diana_barry
you ll have gilbert_blythe in your class after this said diana_barry and he used to being head of his class i can tell you
four year ago his father was sick and had to go out to alberta for his health and gilbert_blythe went with him
but it is nice to keep head of your class he only in the fourth book although he nearly fourteen they were there three year
and gil didnt go to school hardly any until they came back you wont find it so easy to keep head after this anne_shirley
i glad said anne_shirley quickly i couldnt really feel proud of keeping head of little boy and girl of just nine or ten
i got up yesterday spelling ebullition josie_pye was head and mind you she peeped in her book mr_phillips didnt see her he was looking at prissy_andrews but i did
i just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all
those josie_pye girl are cheats all round said diana_barry indignantly as they climbed the fence of the main road
gertie josie_pye actually went and put her milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday did you ever i dont speak to her now
when mr_phillips was in the back of the room hearing prissy_andrews latin diana_barry whispered to anne_shirley that gilbert_blythe sitting right across the aisle from you anne_shirley
she had a good chance to do so for the said gilbert_blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid of ruby_gillis who sat in front of him to the back of her seat
just look at him and see if you dont think he handsome anne_shirley looked accordingly he was a tall boy with curly brown hair roguish hazel eye and a mouth twisted into a teasing smile
presently ruby_gillis started up to take a sum to the master she fell back into her seat with a little shriek believing that her hair was pulled out by the roots
gilbert_blythe had whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the soberest face in the world but when the commotion subsided he looked at anne_shirley and winked with inexpressible drollery
everybody looked at her and mr_phillips glared so sternly that ruby_gillis began to cry i think your gilbert_blythe is handsome confided anne_shirley to diana_barry but i think he very bold
it isnt good manners to wink at a strange girl but it was not until the afternoon that thing really began to happen
mr_phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to prissy_andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as they pleased eating green apple whispering drawing pictures on their slates and driving crickets harnessed to strings up and down aisle
gilbert_blythe was trying to make anne_shirley look at him and failing utterly because anne_shirley was at that moment totally oblivious not only to the very existence of gilbert_blythe but of every other scholar in avonlea school itself
with her chin propped on her hand and her eye fixed on the blue glimpse of the lake of shining waters that the west window afforded she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and seeing nothing save her own wonderful visions
she should look at him that red haired anne_shirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eye that werent like the eye of any other girl in avonlea school
gilbert_blythe reached across the aisle picked up the end of anne_shirley long red braid held it out at arm length and said in a piercing whisper carrots
gilbert_blythe wasnt used to putting himself out to make a girl look at him and meeting with failure carrots
then anne_shirley looked at him with a vengeance she did more than look she sprang to her feet her bright fancies fallen into cureless ruin
she flashed one indignant glance at gilbert_blythe from eye whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry tear you mean hateful boy
she exclaimed passionately how dare you and then thwack anne_shirley had brought her slate down on gilbert_blythe head and cracked it
slate not head clear across avonlea school always enjoyed a scene this was an especially enjoyable one everybody said oh in horrified delight
diana_barry gasped ruby_gillis who was inclined to be hysterical began to cry tommy sloane let his team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared open mouthed at the tableau
mr_phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on anne_shirley shoulder anne_shirley what does this mean
it was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell before the whole school that she had been called carrots
he said angrily anne_shirley returned no answer gilbert_blythe it was who spoke up stoutly it was my fault mr_phillips
i am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such a vindictive spirit he said in a solemn tone as if the mere fact of being a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the heart of small imperfect mortals
i teased her mr_phillips paid no heed to gilbert_blythe anne_shirley go and stand on the platform in front of the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon
anne_shirley would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under which her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash
with a white set face she obeyed mr_phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the blackboard above her head
ann anne_shirley must learn to control her temper and then read it out loud so that even the primer class who couldnt read writing should understand it
ann anne_shirley has a very bad temper anne_shirley stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her
she did not cry or hang her head anger was still too hot in her heart for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation
with resentful eye and passion red cheeks she confronted alike diana_barry sympathetic gaze and charlie_sloane indignant nods and josie_pye malicious smiles
as for gilbert_blythe she would not even look at him she would never look at him again she would never speak to him
when school was dismissed anne_shirley marched out with her red head held high gilbert_blythe tried to intercept her at the porch door
i awfully sorry i made fun of your hair anne_shirley he whispered contritely honest i am dont be mad for keeps now
anne_shirley swept by disdainfully without look or sign of hearing oh how could you anne_shirley breathed diana_barry as they went down the road half reproachfully half admiringly
diana_barry felt that she could never have resisted gilbert_blythe plea i shall never forgive gilbert_blythe said anne_shirley firmly
and mr_phillips spelled my name without an too the iron has entered into my soul diana_barry diana hadnt the least idea what anne_shirley meant
but she understood it was something terrible you mustnt mind gilbert_blythe making fun of your hair she said soothingly
why he makes fun of all the girl he laughs at mine because it so black he called me a crow a dozen time and i never heard him apologize for anything before either
there a great deal of difference between being called a crow and being called carrots said anne_shirley with dignity
gilbert_blythe has hurt my feeling excruciatingly diana_barry it is possible the matter might have blown over without more excruciation if nothing else had happened
avonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in mr_william_bell spruce grove over the hill and across his big pasture field
but when thing begin to happen they are apt to keep on from there they could keep an eye on eben wright house where the master boarded
when they saw mr_phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse but the distance being about three time longer than mr wright lane they were very apt to arrive there breathless and gasping some three minute too late
on the following day mr_phillips was seized with one of his spasmodic fits of reform and announced before going home to dinner that he should expect to find all the scholars in their seats when he returned
all the boy and some of the girl went to mr_william_bell spruce grove as usual fully intending to stay only long enough to pick a chew
but spruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling they picked and loitered and strayed and as usual the first thing that recalled them to a sense of the flight of time was jimmy glover shouting from the top of a patriarchal old spruce master coming
the girl who were on the ground started first and managed to reach the schoolhouse in time but without a second to spare
the boy who had to wriggle hastily down from the tree were later and anne_shirley who had not been picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the grove waist deep among the bracken singing softly to herself with a wreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity of the shadowy place was latest of all
anne_shirley could run like a deer however run she did with the impish result that she overtook the boy at the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as mr_phillips was in the act of hanging up his hat
mr_phillips brief reforming energy was over he didnt want the bother of punishing a dozen pupils but it was necessary to do something to save his word so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it in anne_shirley who had dropped into her seat gasping for breath with a forgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a particularly rakish and disheveled appearance
anne_shirley since you seem to be so fond of the boy company we shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon he said sarcastically
anyone who came in late would be punished take those flower out of your hair and sit with gilbert_blythe
the other boy snickered diana_barry turning pale with pity plucked the wreath from anne_shirley hair and squeezed her hand anne_shirley stared at the master as if turned to stone
did you hear what i said anne_shirley queried mr_phillips sternly yes sir said anne_shirley slowly but i didnt suppose you really meant it
i assure you i did still with the sarcastic inflection which all the child and anne_shirley especially hated it flicked on the raw
then realizing that there was no help for it she rose haughtily stepped across the aisle sat down beside gilbert_blythe and buried her face in her arms on the desk
ruby_gillis who got a glimpse of it as it went down told the others going home from school that she acksually never seen anything like it it was so white with awful little red spots in it
obey me at once for a moment anne_shirley looked as if she meant to disobey to anne_shirley this was as the end of all thing
it was bad enough to be singled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty one it was worse still to be sent to sit with a boy but that that boy should be
gilbert_blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly unbearable anne_shirley felt that she could not bear it and it would be of no use to try
her whole being seethed with shame and anger and humiliation at first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged
but as anne_shirley never lifted her head and as gilbert_blythe worked fractions as if his whole soul was absorbed in them and them only they soon returned to their own tasks and anne_shirley was forgotten
when mr_phillips called the history class out anne_shirley should have gone but anne_shirley did not move and mr_phillips who had been writing some verses to priscilla before he called the class was thinking about an obstinate rhyme still and never missed her
once when nobody was looking gilbert_blythe took from his desk a little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it you are sweet and slipped it under the curve of anne_shirley arm
anne_shirley arose took the pink heart gingerly between the tips of her fingers dropped it on the floor ground it to powder beneath her heel and resumed her position without deigning to bestow a glance on gilbert_blythe
when school went out anne_shirley marched to her desk ostentatiously took out everything therein book and writing tablet pen and ink testament and arithmetic and piled them neatly on her cracked slate
whereupon what are you taking all those thing home for anne_shirley diana_barry wanted to know as soon as they were out on the road
she had not dared to ask the question before i am not coming back to school any more said anne_shirley
diana_barry gasped and stared at anne_shirley to see if she meant it will miss_marilla_cuthbert let you stay home she asked
she ll have to said anne_shirley i ll never go to school to that man again oh anne_shirley
diana_barry looked as if she were ready to cry i do think you re mean what shall i do mr_phillips will make me sit with that horrid gertie josie_pye
i know he will because she is sitting alone do come back anne_shirley i do almost anything in the world for you diana_barry said anne_shirley sadly
i let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good but i cant do this so please dont ask it
we are going to build the loveliest new house down by the brook and we ll be playing ball next week and you ve never played ball anne_shirley
you harrow up my very soul just think of all the fun you will miss mourned diana_barry it tremendously exciting
and we re going to learn a new song jane_andrews is practicing it up now and alice andrews is going to bring a new pansy book next week
and we re all going to read it out loud chapter about down by the brook and you know you are so fond of reading out loud anne_shirley
nothing moved anne_shirley in the least her mind was made up she would not go to school to mr_phillips again she told miss_marilla_cuthbert so when she got home
nonsense said miss_marilla_cuthbert it isnt nonsense at all said anne_shirley gazing at miss_marilla_cuthbert with solemn reproachful eye dont you understand miss_marilla_cuthbert
i ve been insulted insulted fiddlesticks you ll go to school tomorrow as usual oh no anne_shirley shook her head gently
and i ll be as good as i can be and hold my tongue all the time if it possible at all
i not going back miss_marilla_cuthbert i ll learn my lesson at home but i will not go back to school i assure you
miss_marilla_cuthbert saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking out of anne_shirley small face she understood that she would have trouble in overcoming it but she re solved wisely to say nothing more just then
i ll run down and see mrs_rachel_lynde about it this evening she thought there no use reasoning with anne_shirley now
she too worked up and i ve an idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion far as i can make out from her story mr_phillips has been carrying matter with a rather high hand
but it would never do to say so to her i ll just talk it over with mrs_rachel_lynde she sent ten child to school and she ought to know something about it
she ll have heard the whole story too by this time miss_marilla_cuthbert found mrs_rachel_lynde knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully as usual
i suppose you know what i ve come about she said a little shamefacedly mrs_rachel_lynde nodded about anne_shirley fuss in school i reckon she said
tillie boulter was in on her way home from school and told me about it i dont know what to do with her said miss_marilla_cuthbert
she declares she wont go back to school i never saw a child so worked up i ve been expecting trouble ever since she started to school
i knew thing were going too smooth to last she so high strung what would you advise mrs_rachel_lynde well since you ve asked my advice miss_marilla_cuthbert said mrs_rachel_lynde amiably
mrs_rachel_lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice i just humor her a little at first that what i do
it my belief that mr_phillips was in the wrong of course it doesnt do to say so to the child you know
and of course he did right to punish her yesterday for giving way to temper but today it was different the others who were late should have been punished as well as anne_shirley that what
and i dont believe in making the girl sit with the boy for punishment it isnt modest tillie boulter was real indignant
she took anne_shirley part right through and said all the scholars did too anne_shirley seems real popular among them somehow i never thought she take with them so well
then you really think i better let her stay home said miss_marilla_cuthbert in amazement yes that is i wouldnt say school to her again until she said it herself
depend upon it miss_marilla_cuthbert she ll cool off in a week or so and be ready enough to go back of her own accord that what while if you were to make her go back right off dear knows what freak or tantrum she take next and make more trouble than ever
the less fuss made the better in my opinion she wont miss much by not going to school as far as that goes
the order he keeps is scandalous that what and he neglects the young fry and puts all his time on those big scholars he getting ready for queen
he never have got the school for another year if his uncle hadnt been a trustee the trustee for he just leads the other two around by the nose that what
mr_phillips isnt any good at all as a teacher i declare i dont know what education in this island is coming to
mrs_rachel_lynde shook her head as much as to say if she were only at the head of the educational system of the province thing would be much better managed
she learned her lesson at home did her chores and played with diana_barry in the chilly purple autumn twilights but when she met gilbert_blythe on the road or encountered him in sunday school she passed him by with an icy contempt that was no whit thawed by his evident desire to appease her
miss_marilla_cuthbert took mrs_rachel_lynde advice and not another word was said to anne_shirley about going back to school even diana_barry efforts as a peacemaker were of no avail
as much as she hated gilbert_blythe however did she love diana_barry with all the love of her passionate little heart equally intense in its likes and dislikes
one evening miss_marilla_cuthbert coming in from the orchard with a basket of apple found anne_shirley sitting along by the east window in the twilight crying bitterly
anne_shirley had evidently made up her mind to hate gilbert_blythe to the end of life whatever the matter now anne_shirley
she asked it about diana_barry sobbed anne_shirley luxuriously i love diana_barry so miss_marilla_cuthbert i cannot ever live without her
but i know very well when we grow up that diana_barry will get married and go away and leave me and oh what shall i do
i ve been imagining it all out the wedding and everything diana_barry dressed in snowy garments with a veil and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen and me the bridesmaid with a lovely dress too and puffed sleeve but with a breaking heart hid beneath my smiling face
i hate her husband i just hate him furiously and then bidding diana_barry goodbye e here anne_shirley broke down entirely and wept with increasing bitterness
miss_marilla_cuthbert turned quickly away to hide her twitching face but it was no use she collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and unusual peal of laughter that matthew_cuthbert crossing the yard outside halted in amazement
well anne_shirley said miss_marilla_cuthbert as soon as she could speak if you must borrow trouble for pity sake borrow it handier home
when had he heard miss_marilla_cuthbert laugh like that before i should think you had an imagination sure enough chapter xvi
diana_barry is invited to tea with tragic results october was a beautiful month at green gables when the birches in the hollow turned as golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson and
the wild cherry tree along the lane put on the loveliest shades of dark red and bronzy green while the field sunned themselves in aftermaths
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert she exclaimed one saturday morning coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs i so glad i live in a world where there are octobers
anne_shirley reveled in the world of color about her it would be terrible if we just skipped from september to november wouldnt it
look at these maple branches dont they give you a thrill several thrills i going to decorate my room with them messy thing said miss_marilla_cuthbert whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed
you clutter up your room entirely too much with out of door stuff anne_shirley bedrooms were made to sleep in oh and dream in too miss_marilla_cuthbert
and you know one can dream so much better in a room where there are pretty thing i going to put these boughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table
i going on a meeting of the aid society at carmody this afternoon anne_shirley and i wont likely be home before dark
you ll have to get matthew_cuthbert and jerry their supper so mind you dont forget to put the tea to draw until you sit down at the table as you did last time
mind you dont drop leaves all over the stairs then it was dreadful of me to forget said anne_shirley apologetically but that was the afternoon
i was trying to think of a name for violet vale and it crowded other thing out matthew_cuthbert was so good
he never scolded a bit he put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as not
and i told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting so he didnt find the time long at all
it was a beautiful fairy story miss_marilla_cuthbert i forgot the end of it so i made up an end for it myself
and matthew_cuthbert said he couldnt tell where the join came in matthew_cuthbert would think it all right anne_shirley if you took a notion to get up and have dinner in the middle of the night
and i dont really know if i doing right it may make you more addlepated than ever but you can ask diana_barry to come over and spend the afternoon with you and have tea here
you are able to imagine thing after all or else you never have understood how i ve longed for that very thing
but you keep your wits about you this time oh miss_marilla_cuthbert anne_shirley clasped her hand how perfectly lovely it will seem so nice and grown uppish
no fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when i have company oh miss_marilla_cuthbert can i use the rosebud spray tea set
no indeed the rosebud tea set well what next you know i never use that except for the minister or the aids
you ll put down the old brown tea set but you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves it time it was being used anyhow
i believe it beginning to work and you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and snaps
i can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and pouring out the tea said anne_shirley shutting her eye ecstatically
and asking diana_barry if she takes sugar i know she doesnt but of course i ll ask her just as if i didnt know
and then pressing her to take another piece of fruit cake and another helping of preserves oh miss_marilla_cuthbert it a wonderful sensation just to think of it
can i take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes and then into the parlor to sit
no the sitting room will do for you and your company but there a bottle half full of raspberry cordial that was left over from the church social the other night
it on the second shelf of the sitting room closet and you and diana_barry can have it if you like and a cooky to eat with it along in the afternoon for
anne_shirley flew down to the hollow past the dryad bubble and up the spruce path to orchard slope to ask diana_barry to tea
as a result just after miss_marilla_cuthbert had driven off to carmody diana_barry came over dressed in her second best dress and looking exactly as it is proper to look when asked out to tea
at other time she was wont to run into the kitchen without knocking but now she knocked primly at the front door
and when anne_shirley dressed in her second best as primly opened it both little girl shook hand as gravely as if they had never met before
this unnatural solemnity lasted until after diana_barry had been taken to the east gable to lay off her hat and then had sat for ten minute in the sitting room toes in position
i daresay matthew_cuthbert ll be late coming in to tea since he hauling potatoes to the vessel how is your mother
inquired anne_shirley politely just as if she had not seen mrs diana_barry picking apple that morning in excellent health and spirit
she is very well thank you i suppose mr miss_marilla_cuthbert is hauling potatoes to the lily sands this afternoon is he
said diana_barry who had ridden down to mr harmon andrews that morning in matthew_cuthbert cart yes our potato crop is very good this year
i hope your father crop is good too it is fairly good thank you have you picked many of your apple yet
oh ever so many said anne_shirley forgetting to be dignified and jumping up quickly let go out to the orchard and get some of the red sweetings diana_barry
miss_marilla_cuthbert says we can have all that are left on the tree miss_marilla_cuthbert is a very generous woman she said we could have fruit cake and cherry preserves for tea
but it isnt good manners to tell your company what you are going to give them to eat so i wont tell you what she said we could have to drink
only it begins with an and a and it bright red color i love bright red drinks dont you
the orchard with its great sweeping boughs that bent to the ground with fruit proved so delightful that the little girl spent most of the afternoon in it sitting in a grassy corner where the frost had spared the green and the mellow autumn sunshine lingered warmly eating apple and talking as hard as they could
they taste twice as good as any other color diana_barry had much to tell anne_shirley of what went on in school
she had to sit with gertie josie_pye and she hated it gertie squeaked her pencil all the time and it just made her diana_barry blood run cold
ruby_gillis had charmed all her warts away true you live with a magic pebble that old mary joe from the creek gave her
you had to rub the warts with the pebble and then throw it away over your left shoulder at the time of the new moon and the warts would all go
charlie_sloane name was written up with em white on the porch wall and em white was awful mad about it sam boulter had sassed mr_phillips in class and mr_phillips whipped him and sam father came down to the school and dared mr_phillips to lay a hand on one of his child again and mattie andrews had a new red hood and a blue crossover with tassels on it and the air she put on about it were perfectly sickening and lizzie wright didnt speak to mamie wilson because mamie wilson grown up sister had cut out lizzie wright grown up sister with her beau and everybody missed anne_shirley so and wished she come to school again and gilbert_blythe
but anne_shirley didnt want to hear about gilbert_blythe she jumped up hurriedly and said suppose they go in and have some raspberry cordial
anne_shirley looked on the second shelf of the room pantry but there was no bottle of raspberry cordial there search revealed it away back on the top shelf
anne_shirley put it on a tray and set it on the table with a tumbler now please help yourself diana_barry she said politely
i dont believe i ll have any just now i dont feel as if i wanted any after all those apple
diana_barry poured herself out a tumblerful looked at its bright red hue admiringly and then sipped it daintily that awfully nice raspberry cordial anne_shirley she said
i didnt know raspberry cordial was so nice i real glad you like it take as much as you want
i going to run out and stir the fire up there are so many responsibilities on a person mind when they re keeping house isnt there
when anne_shirley came back from the kitchen diana_barry was drinking her second glassful of cordial and being entreated thereto by anne_shirley she offered no particular objection to the drinking of a third
the tumblerfuls were generous one and the raspberry cordial was certainly very nice the nicest i ever drank said diana_barry
it ever so much nicer than mrs_rachel_lynde although she brags of hers so much it doesnt taste a bit like hers
i should think miss_marilla_cuthbert raspberry cordial would prob ly be much nicer than mrs_rachel_lynde said anne_shirley loyally miss_marilla_cuthbert is a famous cook
she is trying to teach me to cook but i assure you diana_barry it is uphill work there so little scope for imagination in cookery
you just have to go by rules the last time i made a cake i forgot to put the flour in
i thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you but i went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life and then i took the smallpox and died
and i was buried under those poplar tree in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tear and you never never forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed her life for you
i was thinking the loveliest story about you and me diana_barry oh it was such a pathetic tale diana_barry the tear just rained down over my cheeks while i mixed the cake
but i forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure flour is so essential to cake you know miss_marilla_cuthbert was very cross
we had a plum pudding for dinner on tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over
miss_marilla_cuthbert said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it
i meant to cover it just as much as could be diana_barry but when i carried it in i was imagining i was a nun
and i dont wonder i a great trial to her she was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week of course i a protestant
but i imagined i was a catholic taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion and i forgot all about covering the pudding sauce
i thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry diana_barry fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce
i lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then i washed the spoon in three waters
miss_marilla_cuthbert was out milking and i fully intended to ask her when she came in if i give the sauce to the pigs but when she did come in i was imagining that i was a frost fairy going through the wood turning the tree red and yellow whichever they wanted to be so i never thought about the pudding sauce again and miss_marilla_cuthbert sent me out to pick apple
well mr and mrs chester ross from spencervale came here that morning you know they are very stylish people especially mrs chester ross
i tried to be as polite and dignified as i could be for i wanted mrs chester ross to think i was a ladylike little girl even if i wasnt pretty
everything went right until i saw miss_marilla_cuthbert coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce warmed up in the other
when miss_marilla_cuthbert called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table diana_barry that was a terrible moment
i remembered everything and i just stood up in my place and shrieked out miss_marilla_cuthbert you mustnt use that pudding sauce
there was a mouse drowned in it i forgot to tell you before oh diana_barry i shall never forget that awful moment if i live to be a hundred
mrs chester ross just looked at me and i thought i would sink through the floor with mortification she is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she must have thought of us
miss_marilla_cuthbert turned red as fire but she never said a word then she just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves
she even offered me some but i couldnt swallow a mouthful it was like heaping coals of fire on my head
after mrs chester ross went away miss_marilla_cuthbert gave me a dreadful scolding why diana_barry what is the matter diana_barry had stood up very unsteadily then she sat down again putting her hand to her head
i i awful sick she said a little thickly i i must go right home oh you mustnt dream of going home without your tea cried anne_shirley in distress
i ll get it right off i ll go and put the tea down this very minute i must go home repeated diana_barry stupidly but determinedly
let me get you a lunch anyhow implored anne_shirley let me give you a bit of fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves
lie down on the sofa for a little while and you ll be better where do you feel bad i must go home said diana_barry and that was all she would say
in vain anne_shirley pleaded i never heard of company going home without tea she mourned oh diana_barry do you suppose that it possible you re really taking the smallpox
if you are i ll go and nurse you you can depend on that i ll never forsake you but i do wish you stay till after tea
anne_shirley with tear of disappointment in her eye got diana_barry hat and went with her as far as the diana_barry yard fence
then she wept all the way back to green gables where she sorrowfully put the remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the pantry and got tea ready for matthew_cuthbert and jerry with all the zest gone out of the performance
the next day was sunday and as the rain poured down in torrents from dawn till dusk anne_shirley did not stir abroad from green gables
where do you feel bad i awful dizzy said diana_barry and indeed she walked very dizzily monday afternoon miss_marilla_cuthbert sent her down to mrs_rachel_lynde on an errand
in a very short space of time anne_shirley came flying back up the lane with tear rolling down her cheeks into the kitchen she dashed and flung herself face downward on the sofa in an agony
whatever has gone wrong now anne_shirley queried miss_marilla_cuthbert in doubt and dismay i do hope you havent gone and been saucy to mrs_rachel_lynde again
no answer from anne_shirley save more tear and stormier sobs anne_shirley when i ask you a question i want to be answered
sit right up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about anne_shirley sat up tragedy personified
mrs_rachel_lynde was up to see mrs diana_barry today and mrs diana_barry was in an awful state she wailed she says that i set diana_barry drunk saturday and sent her home in a disgraceful condition
and she says i must be a thoroughly bad wicked little girl and she never never going to let diana_barry play with me again
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert i just overcome with woe miss_marilla_cuthbert stared in blank amazement set diana_barry drunk she said when she found her voice
anne_shirley are you or mrs diana_barry crazy what on earth did you give her not a thing but raspberry cordial sobbed anne_shirley
i never thought raspberry cordial would set people drunk miss_marilla_cuthbert not even if they drank three big tumblerfuls as diana_barry did
oh it sounds so so like mrs_thomas husband but i didnt mean to set her drunk drunk fiddlesticks said miss_marilla_cuthbert marching to the sitting room pantry
there on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one containing some of her three year old homemade currant wine for which she was celebrated in avonlea although certain of the stricter sort mrs diana_barry among them disapproved strongly of it
and at the same time miss_marilla_cuthbert recollected that she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial down in the cellar instead of in the pantry as she had told anne_shirley
she went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand her face was twitching in spite of herself
anne_shirley you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble you went and gave diana_barry currant wine instead of raspberry cordial
didnt you know the difference yourself i never tasted it said anne_shirley i thought it was the cordial i meant to be so so hospitable
she just laughed silly like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to sleep and slept for hour
diana_barry got awfully sick and had to go home mrs diana_barry told mrs_rachel_lynde she was simply dead drunk her mother smelled her breath and knew she was drunk
she had a fearful headache all day yesterday mrs diana_barry is so indignant she will never believe but what i did it on purpose
i should think she would better punish diana_barry for being so greedy as to drink three glassfuls of anything said miss_marilla_cuthbert shortly
well this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are so down on me for making currant wine although i havent made any for three year ever since i found out that the minister didnt approve
why three of those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been cordial i just kept that bottle for sickness
there there child dont cry i cant see as you were to blame although i sorry it happened so i must cry said anne_shirley
my heart is broken the stars in their course fight against me miss_marilla_cuthbert diana_barry and i are parted forever oh miss_marilla_cuthbert i little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of friendship
dont be foolish anne_shirley mrs diana_barry will think better of it when she finds you re not to blame i suppose she thinks you ve done it for a silly joke or something of that sort
you best go up this evening and tell her how it was my courage fails me at the thought of facing diana_barry injured mother sighed anne_shirley
i wish you go miss_marilla_cuthbert you re so much more dignified than i am likely she listen to you quicker than to me
well i will said miss_marilla_cuthbert reflecting that it would probably be the wiser course dont cry any more anne_shirley
it will be all right miss_marilla_cuthbert had changed her mind about it being all right by the time she got back from orchard slope
anne_shirley was watching for her coming and flew to the porch door to meet her oh miss_marilla_cuthbert i know by your face that it been no use she said sorrowfully
mrs diana_barry wont forgive me mrs diana_barry indeed snapped miss_marilla_cuthbert of all the unreasonable woman i ever saw she the worst
i told her it was all a mistake and you werent to blame but she just simply didnt believe me and she rubbed it well in about my currant wine and
i just told her plainly that currant wine wasnt meant to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a time and that if a child i had to do with was so greedy
how i always said it couldnt have the least effect on anybody i sober her up with a right good spanking
presently anne_shirley stepped out bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk very determinedly and steadily she took her way down through the sere clover field over the log bridge and up through the spruce grove lighted by a pale little moon hanging low over the western wood
miss_marilla_cuthbert whisked into the kitchen grievously disturbed leaving a very much distracted little soul in the porch behind her mrs diana_barry coming to the door in answer to a timid knock found a white lipped eager eyed suppliant on the doorstep
mrs diana_barry was a woman of strong prejudices and dislikes and her anger was of the cold sullen sort which is always hardest to overcome
to do her justice she really believed anne_shirley had made diana_barry drunk out of sheer malice prepense and she was honestly anxious to preserve her little daughter from the contamination of further intimacy with such a child
her face hardened what do you want she said stiffly anne_shirley clasped her hand oh mrs diana_barry please forgive me
just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all the world
i did not mean to to intoxicate diana_barry how could i do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose i thought it was only raspberry cordial
i was firmly convinced it was raspberry cordial oh please dont say that you wont let diana_barry play with me any more
this speech which would have softened good mrs_rachel_lynde heart in a twinkling had no effect on mrs diana_barry except to irritate her still more
if you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe she was suspicious of anne_shirley big word and dramatic gestures and imagined that the child was making fun of her
so she said coldly and cruelly i dont think you are a fit little girl for diana_barry to associate with you better go home and behave yourself
anne_shirley lips quivered wont you let me see diana_barry just once to say farewell she implored diana_barry has gone over to carmody with her father said mrs diana_barry going in and shutting the door
anne_shirley went back to green gables calm with despair my last hope is gone she told miss_marilla_cuthbert i went up and saw mrs diana_barry myself and she treated me very insultingly
and i havent much hope that that ll do much good because miss_marilla_cuthbert i do not believe that god himself can do very much with such an obstinate person as mrs diana_barry
anne_shirley you shouldnt say such thing rebuked miss_marilla_cuthbert striving to overcome that unholy tendency to laughter which she was dismayed to find growing upon her
miss_marilla_cuthbert i do not think she is a well bred woman there is nothing more to do except to pray and indeed when she told the whole story to matthew_cuthbert that night she did laugh heartily over anne_shirley tribulations
but when she slipped into the east gable before going to bed and found that anne_shirley had cried herself to sleep an unaccustomed softness crept into her face
poor little soul she murmured lifting a loose curl of hair from the child tear stained face then she bent down and kissed the flushed cheek on the pillow
anne_shirley bending over her patchwork at the kitchen window happened to glance out and beheld diana_barry down by the dryad bubble beckoning mysteriously
in a trice anne_shirley was out of the house and flying down to the hollow astonishment and hope struggling in her expressive eye
chapter xvii a new interest in life the next afternoon but the hope faded when she saw diana_barry dejected countenance
your mother hasnt relented she gasped diana_barry shook her head mournfully no and oh anne_shirley she says i never to play with you again
i ve cried and cried and i told her it wasnt your fault but it wasnt any use i had ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good bye to you
she said i was only to stay ten minute and she timing me by the clock ten minute isnt very long to say an eternal farewell in said anne_shirley tearfully
oh diana_barry will you promise faithfully never to forget me the friend of your youth no matter what dearer friend may caress thee
indeed i will sobbed diana_barry and i ll never have another bosom friend i dont want to have i couldnt love anybody as i love you
oh diana_barry cried anne_shirley clasping her hand do you love me why of course i do didnt you know that no
anne_shirley drew a long breath i thought you liked me of course but i never hoped you loved me why diana_barry i didnt think anybody could love me
nobody ever has loved me since i can remember oh this is wonderful it a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness of a path severed from thee diana_barry
oh just say it once again i love you devotedly anne_shirley said diana_barry stanchly and i always will you may be sure of that
in the year to come thy memory will shine like a star over my lonely life as that last story we read together says
and i will always love thee diana_barry said anne_shirley solemnly extending her hand diana_barry wilt thou give me a lock of thy jet black tresses in parting to treasure forevermore
have you got anything to cut it with queried diana_barry wiping away the tear which anne_shirley affecting accents had caused to flow afresh and returning to practicalities
yes i ve got my patchwork scissors in my apron pocket fortunately said anne_shirley she solemnly clipped one of diana_barry curls
fare thee well my beloved friend henceforth we must be as strangers though living side by side but my heart will ever be faithful to thee
anne_shirley stood and watched diana_barry out of sight mournfully waving her hand to the latter whenever she turned to look back
then she returned to the house not a little consoled for the time being by this romantic parting it is all over she informed miss_marilla_cuthbert
i shall never have another friend i really worse off than ever before for i havent katie maurice and violetta now
and even if i had it wouldnt be the same somehow little dream girl are not satisfying after a real friend
diana_barry and i had such an affecting farewell down by the spring it will be sacred in my memory forever i used the most pathetic language i could think of and said thou and thee
diana_barry gave me a lock of her hair and i going to sew it up in a little bag and wear it around my neck all my life
thou and thee seem so much more romantic than you please see that it is buried with me for i dont believe i ll live very long
perhaps when she sees me lying cold and dead before her mrs diana_barry may feel remorse for what she has done and will let diana_barry come to my funeral
i dont think there is much fear of your dying of grief as long as you can talk anne_shirley said miss_marilla_cuthbert unsympathetically
the following monday anne_shirley surprised miss_marilla_cuthbert by coming down from her room with her basket of book on her arm and hip and her lips primmed up into a line of determination
i going back to school she announced that is all there is left in life for me now that my friend has been ruthlessly torn from me
in school i can look at her and muse over day departed you better muse over your lesson and sums said miss_marilla_cuthbert concealing her delight at this development of the situation
if you re going back to school i hope we ll hear no more of breaking slates over people head and such carryings on
behave yourself and do just what your teacher tells you i ll try to be a model pupil agreed anne_shirley dolefully
there wont be much fun in it i expect mr_phillips said minnie andrews was a model pupil and there isnt a spark of imagination or life in her
she is just dull and poky and never seems to have a good time but i feel so depressed that perhaps it will come easy to me now
i going round by the road i couldnt bear to go by the birch path all alone i should weep bitter tear if i did
her imagination had been sorely missed in games her voice in the singing and her dramatic ability in the perusal aloud of book at dinner hour
ruby_gillis smuggled three blue plums over to her during testament reading ella may macpherson gave her an enormous yellow pansy cut from the covers of a floral catalogue a species of desk decoration much prized in avonlea school
anne_shirley was welcomed back to school with open arms sophia sloane offered to teach her a perfectly elegant new pattern of knit lace so nice for trimming aprons
katie boulter gave her a perfume bottle to keep slate water in and julia mr_william_bell copied carefully on a piece of pale pink paper scalloped on the edges the following effusion when twilight drops her curtain down and pins it with a star remember that you have a friend
though she may wander far it so nice to be appreciated sighed anne_shirley rapturously to miss_marilla_cuthbert that night the girl were not the only scholars who appreciated her
when anne_shirley went to her seat after dinner hour she had been told by mr_phillips to sit with the model minnie andrews she found on her desk a big luscious strawberry apple
anne_shirley caught it up all ready to take a bite when she remembered that the only place in avonlea where strawberry apple grew was in the old gilbert_blythe orchard on the other side of the lake of shining waters
the apple lay untouched on her desk until the next morning when little timothy andrews who swept the school and kindled the fire annexed it as one of his perquisites
charlie_sloane slate pencil gorgeously bedizened with striped red and yellow paper costing two cents where ordinary pencils cost only one which he sent up to her after dinner hour met with a more favorable reception
anne_shirley was graciously pleased to accept it and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated youth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to make such fearful errors in his dictation that mr_phillips kept him in after school to rewrite it
but as the caesar pageant shorn of brutus bust did but of rome best son remind her more so the marked absence of any tribute or recognition from diana_barry who was sitting with gertie josie_pye embittered anne_shirley little triumph
anne_shirley dropped the apple as if it were a red hot coal and ostentatiously wiped her fingers on her handkerchief
but the next morning a note most fearfully and wonderfully twisted and folded and a small parcel were passed across to anne_shirley
diana_barry might just have smiled at me once i think she mourned to miss_marilla_cuthbert that night dear anne_shirley ran the former
mother says i not to play with you or talk to you even in school it isnt my fault and dont be cross at me because i love you as much as ever
i miss you awfully to tell all my secrets to and i dont like gertie josie_pye one bit i made you one of the new bookmarkers out of red tissue paper
they are awfully fashionable now and only three girl in school know how to make them when you look at it remember your true friend diana_barry
anne_shirley read the note kissed the bookmark and dispatched a prompt reply back to the other side of the school my own darling diana_barry
of course i am not cross at you because you have to obey your mother our spirit can commune i shall keep your lovely present forever
minnie andrews is a very nice little girl although she has no imagination but after having been diana_barry busum friend i cannot be minnie
please excuse mistake because my spelling isnt very good yet although much improoved yours until death us do part anne_shirley or lady_cordelia_fitzgerald anne_shirley
p i shall sleep with your letter under my pillow tonight a or s miss_marilla_cuthbert pessimistically expected more trouble since anne_shirley had again begun to go to school
perhaps anne_shirley caught something of the model spirit from minnie andrews at least she got on very well with mr_phillips
but none developed thenceforth she flung herself into her studies heart and soul determined not to be outdone in any class by gilbert_blythe
the rivalry between them was soon apparent it was entirely good natured on gilbert_blythe side but it is much to be feared that the same thing cannot be said of anne_shirley who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for holding grudges
she would not stoop to admit that she meant to rival gilbert_blythe in schoolwork because that would have been to acknowledge his existence which anne_shirley persistently ignored but the rivalry was there and honors fluctuated between them
now gilbert_blythe was head of the spelling class now anne_shirley with a toss of her long red braids spelled him down
one morning gilbert_blythe had all his sums done correctly and had his name written on the blackboard on the roll of honor the next morning anne_shirley having wrestled wildly with decimals the entire evening before would be first
she was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves one awful day they were ties and their name were written up together
it was almost as bad as a take notice and anne_shirley mortification was as evident as gilbert_blythe satisfaction when the written examinations at the end of each month were held the suspense was terrible
the first month gilbert_blythe came out three marks ahead the second anne_shirley beat him by five but her triumph was marred by the fact that gilbert_blythe congratulated her heartily before the whole school
mr_phillips might not be a very good teacher but a pupil so inflexibly determined on learning as anne_shirley was could hardly escape making progress under any kind of teacher
by the end of the term anne_shirley and gilbert_blythe were both promoted into the fifth class and allowed to begin studying the elements of the branches by which latin geometry french and algebra were meant
it would have been ever so much sweeter to her if he had felt the sting of his defeat in geometry anne_shirley met her waterloo
it perfectly awful stuff miss_marilla_cuthbert she groaned i sure i ll never be able to make head or tail of it
there is no scope for imagination in it at all mr_phillips says i the worst dunce he ever saw at it
and gil i mean some of the others are so smart at it it is extremely mortifying miss_marilla_cuthbert even diana_barry gets along better than i do
but i dont mind being beaten by diana_barry even although we meet as strangers now i still love her with an inextinguishable love
it makes me very sad at time to think about her but really miss_marilla_cuthbert one cant stay sad very long in such an interesting world can one
at first glance it might not seem that the decision of a certain canadian premier to include prince edward island in a political tour could have much or anything to do with the fortunes of little anne_shirley at green gables
it was a january the premier came to address his loyal supporters and such of his nonsupporters as chose to be present at the monster mass meeting held in charlottetown
most of the avonlea people were on premier side of politics hence on the night of the meeting nearly all the man and a goodly proportion of the woman had gone to town thirty miles away
chapter xviii anne_shirley to the rescue all thing great are wound up with all thing little but it had mrs_rachel_lynde had gone too
mrs_rachel_lynde was a red hot politician and couldnt have believed that the political rally could be carried through without her although she was on the opposite side of politics
so she went to town and took her husband mrs_thomas would be useful in looking after the horse and miss_marilla_cuthbert with her
miss_marilla_cuthbert had a sneaking interest in politics herself and as she thought it might be her only chance to see a real live premier she promptly took it leaving anne_shirley and matthew_cuthbert to keep house until her return the following day
hence while miss_marilla_cuthbert and mrs_rachel_lynde were enjoying themselves hugely at the mass meeting anne_shirley and matthew_cuthbert had the cheerful kitchen at green gables all to themselves
matthew_cuthbert nodded over a farmers advocate on the sofa and anne_shirley at the table studied her lesson with grim determination despite sundry wistful glances at the clock shelf where lay a new book that jane_andrews had lent her that day
jane_andrews had assured her that it was warranted to produce any number of thrills or word to that effect and anne_shirley fingers tingled to reach out for it
a bright fire was glowing in the old fashioned waterloo stove and blue white frost crystals were shining on the windowpanes but that would mean gilbert_blythe triumph on the morrow
anne_shirley turned her back on the clock shelf and tried to imagine it wasnt there matthew_cuthbert did you ever study geometry when you went to school
well now no i didnt said matthew_cuthbert coming out of his doze with a start i wish you had sighed anne_shirley because then you be able to sympathize with me
you cant sympathize properly if you ve never studied it it is casting a cloud over my whole life i such a dunce at it matthew_cuthbert
mr_phillips told me last week in blair store at carmody that you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid progress
well now i dunno said matthew_cuthbert soothingly i guess you re all right at anything rapid progress was his very word
there them as runs down teddy phillips and says he aint much of a teacher but i guess he all right
matthew_cuthbert would have thought anyone who praised anne_shirley was all right i sure i get on better with geometry if only he wouldnt change the letters complained anne_shirley
i learn the proposition off by heart and then he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what are in the book
and i get all mixed up i dont think a teacher should take such a mean advantage do you we re studying agriculture now and i ve found out at last what makes the road red
mrs_rachel_lynde says canada is going to the dogs the way thing are being run at ottawa and that it an awful warning to the electors
it a great comfort i wonder how miss_marilla_cuthbert and mrs_rachel_lynde are enjoying themselves she says if woman were allowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change
what way do you vote matthew_cuthbert conservative said matthew_cuthbert promptly to vote conservative was part of matthew_cuthbert religion then i conservative too said anne_shirley decidedly
i guess mr_phillips is a grit too because prissy_andrews father is one and ruby_gillis says that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girl mother in religion and her father in politics
i glad because gil because some of the boy in school are grits is that true matthew_cuthbert well now i dunno said matthew_cuthbert
well now no i dunno i ever did said matthew_cuthbert who had certainly never thought of such a thing in his whole existence
did you ever go courting matthew_cuthbert anne_shirley reflected with her chin in her hand it must be rather interesting dont you think matthew_cuthbert
ruby_gillis says when she grows up she going to have ever so many beaus on the string and have them all crazy about her but i think that would be too exciting
but ruby_gillis knows a great deal about such matter because she has so many big sisters and mrs_rachel_lynde says the ruby_gillis girl have gone off like hot cake
he says it is to help her with her lesson but miranda sloane is studying for queen too and i should think she needed help a lot more than prissy_andrews because she ever so much stupider but he never goes to help her in the evening at all
i rather have just one in his right mind mr_phillips goes up to see prissy_andrews nearly every evening there are a great many thing in this world that i cant understand very well matthew_cuthbert
well now i dunno as i comprehend them all myself acknowledged matthew_cuthbert well i suppose i must finish up my lesson
i wont allow myself to open that new book jane_andrews lent me until i through but it a terrible temptation matthew_cuthbert
even when i turn my back on it i can see it there just as plain jane_andrews said she cried herself sick over it
but i think i ll carry that book into the sitting room and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key
i love a book that makes me cry and you must not give it to me matthew_cuthbert until my lesson are done not even if i implore you on my bended knees
it all very well to say resist temptation but it ever so much easier to resist it if you cant get the key
and then shall i run down the cellar and get some russets matthew_cuthbert wouldnt you like some russets well now i dunno but what i would said matthew_cuthbert who never ate russets but knew anne_shirley weakness for them
just as anne_shirley emerged triumphantly from the cellar with her plateful of russets came the sound of flying footsteps on the icy board walk outside and the next moment the kitchen door was flung open and in rushed diana_barry white faced and breathless with a shawl wrapped hastily around her head
anne_shirley promptly let go of her candle and plate in her surprise and plate candle and apple crashed together down the cellar ladder and were found at the bottom embedded in melted grease the next day by miss_marilla_cuthbert who gathered them up and thanked mercy the house hadnt been set on fire
whatever is the matter diana_barry cried anne_shirley has your mother relented at last oh anne_shirley do come quick implored diana_barry nervously
minnie_may is awful sick she got croup young mary joe says and father and mother are away to town and there nobody to go for the doctor
minnie_may is awful bad and young mary joe doesnt know what to do and oh anne_shirley i so scared
matthew_cuthbert without a word reached out for cap and coat slipped past diana_barry and away into the darkness of the yard
he gone to harness the sorrel mare to go to carmody for the doctor said anne_shirley who was hurrying on hood and jacket
i know it as well as if he said so matthew_cuthbert and i are such kindred spirit i can read his thoughts without word at all
i dont believe he ll find the doctor at carmody sobbed diana_barry i know that dr blair went to town
and i guess dr mrs_alexander_spencer would go too young mary joe never saw anybody with croup and mrs_rachel_lynde is away
oh anne_shirley dont cry di said anne_shirley cheerily i know exactly what to do for croup you forget that mrs_hammond had twins three time
when you look after three pairs of twins you naturally get a lot of experience they all had croup regularly just wait till i get the ipecac bottle you maynt have any at your house
the two little girl hastened out hand in hand and hurried through lover lane and across the crusted field beyond for the snow was too deep to go by the shorter wood way
anne_shirley although sincerely sorry for minnie_may was far from being insensible to the romance of the situation and to the sweetness of once more sharing that romance with a kindred spirit
the night was clear and frosty all ebony of shadow and silver of snowy slope big stars were shining over the silent field here and there the dark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the wind whistling through them
anne_shirley thought it was truly delightful to go skimming through all this mystery and loveliness with your bosom friend who had been so long estranged
come on now minnie_may aged three was really very sick she lay on the kitchen sofa feverish and restless while her hoarse breathing could be heard all over the house
young mary joe a buxom broad faced french girl from the creek whom mrs diana_barry had engaged to stay with the child during her absence was helpless and bewildered quite incapable of thinking what to do or doing it if she thought of it
anne_shirley went to work with skill and promptness minnie_may has croup all right she pretty bad but i ve seen them worse
first we must have lot of hot water i declare diana_barry there isnt more than a cupful in the kettle there i ve filled it up and mary joe you may put some wood in the stove
i dont want to hurt your feeling but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if you any imagination
now i ll undress minnie_may and put her to bed and you try to find some soft flannel cloths diana_barry i going to give her a dose of ipecac first of all
minnie_may did not take kindly to the ipecac but anne_shirley had not brought up three pairs of twins for nothing
down that ipecac went not only once but many time during the long anxious night when the two little girl worked patiently over the suffering minnie_may and young mary joe honestly anxious to do all she could kept up a roaring fire and heated more water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies
it was three clock when matthew_cuthbert came with a doctor for he had been obliged to go all the way to spencervale for one
but the pressing need for assistance was past minnie_may was much better and was sleeping soundly i was awfully near giving up in despair explained anne_shirley
she got worse and worse until she was sicker than ever the mrs_hammond twins were even the last pair i actually thought she was going to choke to death
i said to myself not to diana_barry or young mary joe because i didnt want to worry them any more than they were worried but i had to say it to myself just to relieve my feeling this
i gave her every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose went down is the last lingering hope
and i fear tis a vain one but in about three minute she coughed up the phlegm and began to get better right away
you must just imagine my relief doctor because i cant express it in word you know there are some thing that cannot be expressed in word
yes i know nodded the doctor he looked at anne_shirley as if he were thinking some thing about her that couldnt be expressed in word
later on however he expressed them to mr and mrs diana_barry that little redheaded girl they have over at miss_marilla_cuthbert is as smart as they make em
i tell you she saved that baby life for it would have been too late by the time i got there
she seems to have a skill and presence of mind perfectly wonderful in a child of her age i never saw anything like the eye of her when she was explaining the case to me
anne_shirley had gone home in the wonderful white frosted winter morning heavy eyed from loss of sleep but still talking unweariedly to matthew_cuthbert as they crossed the long white field and walked under the glittering fairy arch of the lover lane maples
oh matthew_cuthbert isnt it a wonderful morning the world look like something god had just imagined for his own pleasure doesnt it
those tree look as if i could blow them away with a breath pouf i so glad i live in a world where there are white frosts arent you
and i so glad mrs_hammond had three pairs of twins after all if she hadnt i mightnt have known what to do for minnie_may
i real sorry i was ever cross with mrs_hammond for having twins but oh matthew_cuthbert i so sleepy i cant go to school
but i hate to stay home for gil some of the others will get head of the class and it so hard to get up again although of course the harder it is the more satisfaction you have when you do get up havent you
well now i guess you ll manage all right said matthew_cuthbert looking at anne_shirley white little face and the dark shadows under her eye
i just know i couldnt keep my eye open and i be so stupid you just go right to bed and have a good sleep
anne_shirley accordingly went to bed and slept so long and soundly that it was well on in the white and rosy winter afternoon when she awoke and descended to the kitchen where miss_marilla_cuthbert who had arrived home in the meantime was sitting knitting
i ll do all the chores oh did you see the premier exclaimed anne_shirley at once what did he look like miss_marilla_cuthbert
well he never got to be premier on account of his look said miss_marilla_cuthbert such a nose as that man had
but he can speak i was proud of being a conservative mrs_rachel_lynde of course being a liberal had no use for him
your dinner is in the oven anne_shirley and you can get yourself some blue plum preserve out of the pantry i guess you re hungry
matthew_cuthbert has been telling me about last night i must say it was fortunate you knew what to do i wouldnt have had any idea myself for i never saw a case of croup
there now never mind talking till you ve had your dinner i can tell by the look of you that you re just full up with speeches but they ll keep
miss_marilla_cuthbert had something to tell anne_shirley but she did not tell it just then for she knew if she did anne_shirley consequent excitement would lift her clear out of the region of such material matter as appetite or dinner
not until anne_shirley had finished her saucer of blue plums did miss_marilla_cuthbert say mrs diana_barry was here this afternoon anne_shirley
she says you saved minnie_may life and she is very sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine
she says she knows now you didnt mean to set diana_barry drunk and she hopes you ll forgive her and be good friend with diana_barry again
you re to go over this evening if you like for diana_barry cant stir outside the door on account of a bad cold she caught last night
she wanted to see you but i wouldnt wake you up now anne_shirley for pity sake dont fly up into the air
the warning seemed not unnecessary so uplifted and aerial was anne_shirley expression and attitude as she sprang to her feet her face irradiated with the flame of her spirit
i ll wash them when i come back but i cannot tie myself down to anything so unromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert can i go right now without washing my dishes yes yes run along said miss_marilla_cuthbert indulgently
anne_shirley are you crazy come back this instant and put something on you i might as well call to the wind
she gone without a cap or wrap look at her tearing through the orchard with her hair streaming it ll be a mercy if she doesnt catch her death of cold
afar in the southwest was the great shimmering pearl like sparkle of an evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal rose over gleaming white spaces and dark glens of spruce
the tinkles of sleigh bells among the snowy hill came like elfin chimes through the frosty air but their music was not sweeter than the song in anne_shirley heart and on her lips
anne_shirley came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy place you see before you a perfectly happy person miss_marilla_cuthbert she announced
i perfectly happy yes in spite of my red hair just at present i have a soul above red hair mrs diana_barry kissed me and cried and said she was so sorry and she could never repay me
i felt fearfully embarrassed miss_marilla_cuthbert but i just said as politely as i could i have no hard feeling for you mrs diana_barry
i assure you once for all that i did not mean to intoxicate diana_barry and henceforth i shall cover the past with the mantle of oblivion
that was a pretty dignified way of speaking wasnt it miss_marilla_cuthbert i felt that i was heaping coals of fire on mrs diana_barry head
and diana_barry and i had a lovely afternoon diana_barry showed me a new fancy crochet stitch her aunt over at carmody taught her
not a soul in avonlea knows it but us and we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else
diana_barry gave me a beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of poetry if you love me as i love you nothing but death can part us two
we re going to ask mr_phillips to let us sit together in school again and gertie josie_pye can go with minnie andrews
and that is true miss_marilla_cuthbert we had an elegant tea mrs diana_barry had the very best china set out miss_marilla_cuthbert just as if i was real company
i cant tell you what a thrill it gave me nobody ever used their very best china on my account before
and we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of preserves miss_marilla_cuthbert and mrs diana_barry asked me if i took tea and said pa why dont you pass the biscuits to anne_shirley
it must be lovely to be grown up miss_marilla_cuthbert when just being treated as if you were is so nice
well anyway when i am grown up said anne_shirley decidedly i always going to talk to little girl as if they were too and i ll never laugh when they use big word
i dont know about that said miss_marilla_cuthbert with a brief sigh i know from sorrowful experience how that hurts one feeling
after tea diana_barry and i made taffy the taffy wasnt very good i suppose because neither diana_barry nor i had ever made any before
diana_barry left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and i forgot and let it burn and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat walked over one plate and that had to be thrown away
but the making of it was splendid fun then when i came home mrs diana_barry asked me to come over as often as i could
i assure you miss_marilla_cuthbert that i feel like praying tonight and i going to think out a special brand new prayer in honor of the occasion
and diana_barry stood at the window and threw kisses to me all the way down to lover lane chapter xix
a concert a catastrophe and a confession miss_marilla_cuthbert can i go over to see diana_barry just for a minute asked anne_shirley running breathlessly down from the east gable one february evening
you and diana_barry walked home from school together and then stood down there in the snow for half an hour more
i dont see what you want to be traipsing about after dark for said miss_marilla_cuthbert shortly your tongues going the whole blessed time clickety clack
so i dont think you re very badly off to see her again but she wants to see me pleaded anne_shirley
she has something very important to tell me how do you know she has because she just signaled to me from her window
we have arranged a way to signal with our candles and cardboard we set the candle on the window sill and make flashes by passing the cardboard back and forth
so many flashes mean a certain thing it was my idea miss_marilla_cuthbert i ll warrant you it was said miss_marilla_cuthbert emphatically
and the next thing you ll be setting fire to the curtains with your signaling nonsense oh we re very careful miss_marilla_cuthbert
and it so interesting two flashes mean are you there three mean yes and four no five mean come over as soon as possible because i have something important to reveal
diana_barry has just signaled five flashes and i really suffering to know what it is well you neednt suffer any longer said miss_marilla_cuthbert sarcastically
anne_shirley did remember it and was back in the stipulated time although probably no mortal will ever know just what it cost her to confine the discussion of diana_barry important communication within the limits of ten minute
you can go but you re to be back here in just ten minute remember that but at least she had made good use of them
well her mother told her she could ask me to go home with her from school and stay all night with her
and her cousins are coming over from newbridge in a big pung sleigh to go to the debating club concert at the hall tomorrow night
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert what do you think you know tomorrow is diana_barry birthday and they are going to take diana_barry and me to the concert
if you ll let me go that is you will wont you miss_marilla_cuthbert oh i feel so excited you can calm down then because you re not going
you re better at home in your own bed and as for that club concert it all nonsense and little girl should not be allowed to go out to such place at all
i sure the debating club is a most respectable affair pleaded anne_shirley i not saying it isnt but you re not going to begin gadding about to concert and staying out all hour of the night
pretty doings for child i surprised at mrs diana_barry letting diana_barry go but it such a very special occasion mourned anne_shirley on the verge of tear
diana_barry has only one birthday in a year it isnt as if birthdays were common thing miss_marilla_cuthbert prissy_andrews is going to recite curfew must not ring tonight
that is such a good moral piece miss_marilla_cuthbert i sure it would do me lot of good to hear it and the choir are going to sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns
and oh miss_marilla_cuthbert the minister is going to take part yes indeed he is he going to give an address that will be just about the same thing as a sermon
please maynt i go miss_marilla_cuthbert you heard what i said anne_shirley didnt you take off your boots now and go to bed
it past eight there just one more thing miss_marilla_cuthbert said anne_shirley with the air of producing the last shot in her locker
mrs diana_barry told diana_barry that we might sleep in the spare room bed think of the honor of your little anne_shirley being put in the spare room bed
it an honor you ll have to get along without go to bed anne_shirley and dont let me hear another word out of you
when anne_shirley with tear rolling over her cheeks had gone sorrowfully upstairs matthew_cuthbert who had been apparently sound asleep on the lounge during the whole dialogue opened his eye and said decidedly
well now miss_marilla_cuthbert i think you ought to let anne_shirley go i dont then retorted miss_marilla_cuthbert who bringing this child up matthew_cuthbert you or me
well now you admitted matthew_cuthbert dont interfere then well now i aint interfering it aint interfering to have your own opinion
and my opinion is that you ought to let anne_shirley go you think i ought to let anne_shirley go to the moon if she took the notion
i ve no doubt was miss_marilla_cuthbert amiable rejoinder i might have let her spend the night with diana_barry if that was all
but i dont approve of this concert plan she go there and catch cold like as not and have her head filled up with nonsense and excitement
it would unsettle her for a week i understand that child disposition and what good for it better than you matthew_cuthbert
i think you ought to let anne_shirley go repeated matthew_cuthbert firmly argument was not his strong point but holding fast to his opinion certainly was
the next morning when anne_shirley was washing the breakfast dishes in the pantry matthew_cuthbert paused on his way out to the barn to say to miss_marilla_cuthbert again
miss_marilla_cuthbert gave a gasp of helplessness and took refuge in silence i think you ought to let anne_shirley go miss_marilla_cuthbert
for a moment miss_marilla_cuthbert looked thing not lawful to be uttered then she yielded to the inevitable and said tartly very well she can go since nothing else ll please you
anne_shirley flew out of the pantry dripping dishcloth in hand oh miss_marilla_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert say those blessed word again
if you catch pneumonia sleeping in a strange bed or coming out of that hot hall in the middle of the night dont blame me blame matthew_cuthbert
i guess once is enough to say them this is matthew_cuthbert doings and i wash my hand of it anne_shirley you re dripping greasy water all over the floor
i never saw such a careless child oh i know i a great trial to you miss_marilla_cuthbert said anne_shirley repentantly
i make so many mistake but then just think of all the mistake i dont make although i might i ll get some sand and scrub up the spots before i go to school
i never was to a concert in my life and when the other girl talk about them in school i feel so out of it
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert my heart was just set on going to that concert you didnt know just how i felt about it but you see matthew_cuthbert did
matthew_cuthbert understands me and it so nice to be understood miss_marilla_cuthbert anne_shirley was too excited to do herself justice as to lesson that morning in school
gilbert_blythe spelled her down in class and left her clear out of sight in mental arithmetic anne_shirley consequent humiliation was less than it might have been however in view of the concert and the spare room bed
she and diana_barry talked so constantly about it all day that with a stricter teacher than mr_phillips dire disgrace must inevitably have been their portion
anne_shirley felt that she could not have borne it if she had not been going to the concert for nothing else was discussed that day in school
the avonlea debating club which met fortnightly all winter had had several smaller free entertainments but this was to be a big affair admission ten cents in aid of the library
the avonlea young people had been practicing for week and all the scholars were especially interested in it by reason of older brothers and sisters who were going to take part
everybody in school over nine year of age expected to go except carrie sloane whose father shared miss_marilla_cuthbert opinions about small girl going out to night concert
for anne_shirley the real excitement began with the dismissal of school and increased therefrom in crescendo until it reached to a crash of positive ecstasy in the concert itself
carrie sloane cried into her grammar all the afternoon and felt that life was not worth living they had a perfectly elegant tea and then came the delicious occupation of dressing in diana_barry little room upstairs
diana_barry did anne_shirley front hair in the new pompadour style and anne_shirley tied diana_barry bows with the especial knack she possessed and they experimented with at least half a dozen different way of arranging their back hair
true anne_shirley could not help a little pang when she contrasted her plain black tam and shapeless tight sleeved homemade gray cloth coat with diana_barry jaunty fur cap and smart little jacket
at last they were ready cheeks scarlet and eye glowing with excitement but she remembered in time that she had an imagination and could use it
then diana_barry cousins the murrays from newbridge came they all crowded into the big pung sleigh among straw and furry robes
anne_shirley reveled in the drive to the hall slipping along over the satin smooth road with the snow crisping under the runners
there was a magnificent sunset and the snowy hill and deep blue water of the st lawrence gulf seemed to rim in the splendor like a huge bowl of pearl and sapphire brimmed with wine and fire
tinkles of sleigh bells and distant laughter that seemed like the mirth of wood elves came from every quarter oh diana_barry breathed anne_shirley squeezing diana_barry mittened hand under the fur robe isnt it all like a beautiful dream
do i really look the same as usual i feel so different that it seems to me it must show in my look
you look awfully nice said diana_barry who having just received a compliment from one of her cousins felt that she ought to pass it on
the program that night was a series of thrills for at least one listener in the audience and as anne_shirley assured diana_barry every succeeding thrill was thrillier than the last
when prissy_andrews attired in a new pink silk waist with a string of pearls about her smooth white throat and real carnations in her hair rumor whispered that the master had sent all the way to town for them for her climbed the slimy ladder dark without one ray of light anne_shirley shivered in luxurious sympathy when the choir sang far above the gentle daisies anne_shirley gazed at the ceiling as if it were frescoed with angels when sam sloane proceeded to explain and illustrate how sockery set a hen
anne_shirley laughed until people sitting near her laughed too more out of sympathy with her than with amusement at a selection that was rather threadbare even in avonlea and when mr_phillips gave mark antony oration over the dead body of caesar in the most heart stirring tones looking at prissy_andrews at the end of every sentence anne_shirley felt that she could rise and mutiny on the spot
you ve got the loveliest color if but one roman citizen led the way only one number on the program failed to interest her
anne_shirley picked up rhoda murray library book and read it until he had finished when she sat rigidly stiff and motionless while diana_barry clapped her hand until they tingled
it was eleven when they got home sated with dissipation but with the exceeding sweet pleasure of talking it all over still to come
when gilbert_blythe recited bingen on the rhine everybody seemed asleep and the house was dark and silent anne_shirley and diana_barry tiptoed into the parlor a long narrow room out of which the spare room opened
it was pleasantly warm and dimly lighted by the embers of a fire in the grate let undress here said diana_barry
it so nice and warm hasnt it been a delightful time sighed anne_shirley rapturously it must be splendid to get up and recite there
do you suppose we will ever be asked to do it diana_barry yes of course someday they re always wanting the big scholars to recite
gilbert_blythe does often and he only two year older than us oh anne_shirley how could you pretend not to listen to him
diana_barry said anne_shirley with dignity you are my bosom friend but i cannot allow even you to speak to me of that person
when he came to the line there another not a sister he looked right down at you are you ready for bed
the two little white clad figures flew down the long room through the spare room door and bounded on the bed at the same moment
let run a race and see who ll get to the bed first the suggestion appealed to diana_barry and then something moved beneath them there was a gasp and a cry and somebody said in muffled accents
merciful goodness anne_shirley and diana_barry were never able to tell just how they got off that bed and out of the room
they only knew that after one frantic rush they found themselves tiptoeing shiveringly upstairs oh who was it what was it
whispered anne_shirley her teeth chattering with cold and fright it was aunt miss_josephine_barry said diana_barry gasping with laughter
oh anne_shirley it was aunt miss_josephine_barry however she came to be there oh and i know she will be furious it dreadful it really dreadful but did you ever know anything so funny anne_shirley
who is your aunt miss_josephine_barry she father aunt and she life in charlottetown she awfully old seventy anyhow and i dont believe she was ever a little girl
we were expecting her out for a visit but not so soon she awfully prim and proper and she ll scold dreadfully about this i know
well we ll have to sleep with minnie_may and you cant think how she kicks miss miss_josephine_barry diana_barry did not appear at the early breakfast the next morning
i tried to stay awake until you came home for i wanted to tell you aunt miss_josephine_barry had come and that you would have to go upstairs after all but i was so tired i fell asleep
mrs diana_barry smiled kindly at the two little girl did you have a good time last night i hope you didnt disturb your aunt diana_barry
anne_shirley hurried home after breakfast and so remained in blissful ignorance of the disturbance which presently resulted in the diana_barry household until the late afternoon when she went down to mrs_rachel_lynde on an errand for miss_marilla_cuthbert
so you and diana_barry nearly frightened poor old miss diana_barry to death last night said mrs_rachel_lynde severely but with a twinkle in her eye
diana_barry preserved a discreet silence but she and anne_shirley exchanged furtive smiles of guilty amusement across the table
old miss diana_barry was in a terrible temper when she got up this morning and miss_josephine_barry diana_barry temper is no joke i can tell you that
mrs diana_barry was here a few minute ago on her way to carmody she feeling real worried over it she wouldnt speak to diana_barry at all
it wasnt diana_barry fault said anne_shirley contritely it was mine i suggested racing to see who would get into bed first
i knew it said mrs_rachel_lynde with the exultation of a correct guesser i knew that idea came out of your head
old miss diana_barry came out to stay for a month but she declares she wont stay another day and is going right back to town tomorrow sunday and all as it is
she had promised to pay for a quarter music lesson for diana_barry but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a tomboy
well it made a nice lot of trouble that what she have gone today if they could have taken her oh i guess they had a lively time of it there this morning
the barrys must feel cut up old miss diana_barry is rich and they like to keep on the good side of her
of course mrs diana_barry didnt say just that to me but i a pretty good judge of human nature that what
i such an unlucky girl mourned anne_shirley i always getting into scrapes myself and getting my best friend people i shed my heart blood for into them too
can you tell me why it is so mrs_rachel_lynde it because you re too heedless and impulsive child that what
you never stop to think whatever comes into your head to say or do you say or do it without a moment reflection
oh but that the best of it protested anne_shirley something just flashes into your mind so exciting and you must out with it
if you stop to think it over you spoil it all havent you never felt that yourself mrs_rachel_lynde no mrs_rachel_lynde had not
she shook her head sagely you must learn to think a little anne_shirley that what the proverb you need to go by is look before you leap especially into spare room bed
mrs_rachel_lynde laughed comfortably over her mild joke but anne_shirley remained pensive she saw nothing to laugh at in the situation which to her eye appeared very serious
when she left mrs_rachel_lynde she took her way across the crusted field to orchard slope diana_barry met her at the kitchen door
your aunt miss_josephine_barry was very cross about it wasnt she whispered anne_shirley yes answered diana_barry stifling a giggle with an apprehensive glance over her shoulder at the closed sitting room door
she said i was the worst behaved girl she ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed of the way they had brought me up
she was fairly dancing with rage anne_shirley oh how she scolded she says she wont stay and i sure i dont care
but father and mother do why didnt you tell them it was my fault demanded anne_shirley it likely i do such a thing isnt it said diana_barry with just scorn
i no telltale anne_shirley and anyhow i was just as much to blame as you well i going in to tell her myself said anne_shirley resolutely
diana_barry stared anne_shirley you never why she ll eat you alive dont frighten me any more than i am frightened implored anne_shirley
i rather walk up to a cannon mouth but i ve got to do it diana_barry it was my fault and i ve got to confess
i ve had practice in confessing fortunately well she in the room said diana_barry you can go in if you want to
with this encouragement anne_shirley bearded the lion in its den that is to say walked resolutely up to the sitting room door and knocked faintly
miss miss_josephine_barry diana_barry thin prim and rigid was knitting fiercely by the fire her wrath quite unappeased and her eye snapping through her gold rimmed glasses
she wheeled around in her chair expecting to see diana_barry and beheld a white faced girl whose great eye were brimmed up with a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror
i wouldnt dare and i dont believe you ll do a bit of good a sharp come in followed who are you demanded miss miss_josephine_barry diana_barry without ceremony
i anne_shirley of green gables said the small visitor tremulously clasping her hand with her characteristic gesture and i ve come to confess if you please
confess what that it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night i suggested it
diana_barry would never have thought of such a thing i am sure diana_barry is a very ladylike girl miss diana_barry so you must see how unjust it is to blame her
oh i must hey i rather think diana_barry did her share of the jumping at least such carryings on in a respectable house
but we were only in fun persisted anne_shirley i think you ought to forgive us miss diana_barry now that we ve apologized
diana_barry heart is set on her music lesson miss diana_barry and i know too well what it is to set your heart on a thing and not get it
and anyhow please forgive diana_barry and let her have her music lesson if you must be cross with anyone be cross with me
i ve been so used in my early day to having people cross at me that i can endure it much better than diana_barry can
much of the snap had gone out of the old lady eye by this time and was replaced by a twinkle of amused interest
but she still said severely i dont think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun
you dont know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep after a long and arduous journey by two great girl coming bounce down on you
little girl never indulged in that kind of fun when i was young i dont know but i can imagine said anne_shirley eagerly
i sure it must have been very disturbing but then there is our side of it too have you any imagination miss diana_barry
if you have just put yourself in our place we didnt know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly scared us to death
it was simply awful the way we felt and then we couldnt sleep in the spare room after being promised i suppose you are used to sleeping in spare room
but just imagine what you would feel like if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor
miss diana_barry actually laughed a sound which caused diana_barry waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen outside to give a great gasp of relief
all the snap had gone by this time i afraid my imagination is a little rusty it so long since i used it she said
i dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as mine it all depends on the way we look at it
i would like to because you seem like an interesting lady and you might even be a kindred spirit although you dont look very much like it
sit down here and tell me about yourself i am very sorry i cant said anne_shirley firmly but it is my duty to go home to miss_marilla_cuthbert
miss_marilla_cuthbert is a very kind lady who has taken me to bring up properly she is doing her best but it is very discouraging work
but before i go i do wish you would tell me if you will forgive diana_barry and stay just as long as you meant to in avonlea
you must not blame her because i jumped on the bed i think perhaps i will if you will come over and talk to me occasionally said miss diana_barry
that evening miss diana_barry gave diana_barry a silver bangle bracelet and told the senior members of the household that she had unpacked her valise
i ve made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better acquainted with that anne_shirley girl she said frankly
she amuses me and at my time of life an amusing person is a rarity miss_marilla_cuthbert only comment when she heard the story was i told you so
this was for matthew_cuthbert benefit miss diana_barry stayed her month out and over she was a more agreeable guest than usual for anne_shirley kept her in good humor
they became firm friend when miss diana_barry went away she said remember you anne_shirley girl when you come to town you re to visit me
and i ll put you in my very sparest spare room bed to sleep miss diana_barry was a kindred spirit after all anne_shirley confided to miss_marilla_cuthbert
you dont find it right out at first as in matthew_cuthbert case but after a while you come to see it
you wouldnt think so to look at her but she is kindred spirit are not so scarce as i used to think
a good imagination gone wrong spring had come once more to green gables the beautiful capricious reluctant canadian spring lingering along through april and may in a succession of sweet fresh chilly day with pink sunsets and miracles of resurrection and growth
it splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world chapter xx the maples in lover lane were red budded and little curly ferns pushed up around the dryad bubble
away up in the barrens behind mr silas sloane place the mayflowers blossomed out pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves
all the school girl and boy had one golden afternoon gathering them coming home in the clear echoing twilight with arms and baskets full of flowery spoil
i so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no mayflowers said anne_shirley diana_barry says perhaps they have something better but there couldnt be anything better than mayflowers could there miss_marilla_cuthbert
and diana_barry says if they dont know what they are like they dont miss them but i think that is the saddest thing of all
i think it would be tragic miss_marilla_cuthbert not to know what mayflowers are like and not to miss them do you know what i think mayflowers are miss_marilla_cuthbert
i think they must be the souls of the flower that died last summer and this is their heaven but we had a splendid time today miss_marilla_cuthbert
we had our lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well such a romantic spot charlie_sloane dared arty ruby_gillis to jump over it and arty did because he wouldnt take a dare
nobody would in school it is very fashionable to dare mr_phillips gave all the mayflowers he found to prissy_andrews
and i heard him to say sweets to the sweet he got that out of a book i know but it shows he has some imagination
i was offered some mayflowers too but i rejected them with scorn i cant tell you the person name because i have vowed never to let it cross my lips
we marched in procession down the road two by two with our bouquets and wreaths singing my home on the hill
we made wreaths of the mayflowers and put them on our hats and when the time came to go home oh it was so thrilling miss_marilla_cuthbert
all mr silas sloane folks rushed out to see us and everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us
we made a real sensation not much wonder such silly doings was miss_marilla_cuthbert response after the mayflowers came the violets and violet vale was empurpled with them
anne_shirley walked through it on her way to school with reverent steps and worshiping eye as if she trod on holy ground
somehow she told diana_barry when i going through here i dont really care whether gil whether anybody gets ahead of me in class or not
but when i up in school it all different and i care as much as ever there such a lot of different annes in me
if i was just the one anne_shirley it would be ever so much more comfortable but then it wouldnt be half so interesting
one june evening when the orchards were pink blossomed again when the frogs were singing silverly sweet in the marshes about the head of the lake of shining waters and the air was full of the savor of clover field and balsamic fir wood anne_shirley was sitting by her gable window
she had been studying her lesson but it had grown too dark to see the book so she had fallen into wide eyed reverie looking out past the boughs of the snow queen once more bestarred with its tufts of blossom
i sometimes think that is why i such a troublesome person in all essential respects the little gable chamber was unchanged
the walls were as white the pincushion as hard the chairs as stiffly and yellowly upright as ever yet the whole character of the room was altered
it was full of a new vital pulsing personality that seemed to pervade it and to be quite independent of schoolgirl book and dress and ribbons and even of the cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms on the table
it was as if all the dream sleeping and waking of its vivid occupant had taken a visible although unmaterial form and had tapestried the bare room with splendid filmy tissues of rainbow and moonshine
presently miss_marilla_cuthbert came briskly in with some of anne_shirley freshly ironed school aprons she hung them over a chair and sat down with a short sigh
she had had one of her headaches that afternoon and although the pain had gone she felt weak and tuckered out as she expressed it
anne_shirley looked at her with eye limpid with sympathy i do truly wish i could have had the headache in your place miss_marilla_cuthbert
i would have endured it joyfully for your sake i guess you did your part in attending to the work and letting me rest said miss_marilla_cuthbert
you seem to have got on fairly well and made fewer mistake than usual of course it wasnt exactly necessary to starch matthew_cuthbert handkerchiefs
and most people when they put a pie in the oven to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of leaving it to be burned to a crisp
but that doesnt seem to be your way evidently headaches always left miss_marilla_cuthbert somewhat sarcastic oh i so sorry said anne_shirley penitently
i never thought about that pie from the moment i put it in the oven till now although i felt instinctively that there was something missing on the dinner table
i was firmly resolved when you left me in charge this morning not to imagine anything but keep my thoughts on facts
i did pretty well until i put the pie in and then an irresistible temptation came to me to imagine i was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a handsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal black steed
so that is how i came to forget the pie i didnt know i starched the handkerchiefs all the time i was ironing
i was trying to think of a name for a new island diana_barry and i have discovered up the brook it the most ravishing spot miss_marilla_cuthbert
at last it struck me that it would be splendid to call it victoria island because we found it on the queen birthday
there are two maple tree on it and the brook flows right around it both diana_barry and i are very loyal
but i sorry about that pie and the handkerchiefs i wanted to be extra good today because it an anniversary do you remember what happened this day last year miss_marilla_cuthbert
no i cant think of anything special oh miss_marilla_cuthbert it was the day i came to green gables i shall never forget it
it was the turning point in my life of course it wouldnt seem so important to you i ve been here for a year
and i ve been so happy of course i ve had my trouble but one can live down trouble are you sorry you kept me miss_marilla_cuthbert
no i cant say i sorry said miss_marilla_cuthbert who sometimes wondered how she could have lived before anne_shirley came to green gables no not exactly sorry
if you ve finished your lesson anne_shirley i want you to run over and ask mrs diana_barry if she ll lend me diana_barry apron pattern
oh it it too dark cried anne_shirley too dark why it only twilight and goodness knows you ve gone over often enough after dark
i ll go over early in the morning said anne_shirley eagerly i ll get up at sunrise and go over miss_marilla_cuthbert
what has got into your head now anne_shirley i want that pattern to cut out your new apron this evening
go at once and be smart too i ll have to go around by the road then said anne_shirley taking up her hat reluctantly
go by the road and waste half an hour i like to catch you i cant go through the haunted wood miss_marilla_cuthbert cried anne_shirley desperately
miss_marilla_cuthbert stared the haunted wood are you crazy what under the canopy is the haunted wood the spruce wood over the brook said anne_shirley in a whisper
fiddlesticks there is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere who has been telling you such stuff nobody confessed anne_shirley
diana_barry and i just imagined the wood was haunted all the place around here are so so commonplace we just got this up for our own amusement
we began it in april a haunted wood is so very romantic miss_marilla_cuthbert we chose the spruce grove because it so gloomy
there a white lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings her hand and utters wailing cries
and the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the corner up by idlewild it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers on your hand so
oh we have imagined the most harrowing thing she appears when there is to be a death in the family oh miss_marilla_cuthbert it gives me a shudder to think of it
and there a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower at you between the boughs oh miss_marilla_cuthbert i wouldnt go through the haunted wood after dark now for anything
i be sure that white thing would reach out from behind the tree and grab me did ever anyone hear the like
ejaculated miss_marilla_cuthbert who had listened in dumb amazement anne_shirley do you mean to tell me you believe all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination
not believe exactly faltered anne_shirley at least i dont believe it in daylight but after dark miss_marilla_cuthbert it different
that is when ghosts walk there are no such thing as ghosts anne_shirley oh but there are miss_marilla_cuthbert cried anne_shirley eagerly
charlie_sloane says that his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night after he been buried for a year
i know people who have seen them and they are respectable people you know charlie_sloane grandmother wouldnt tell a story for anything
and mrs_thomas father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with its head cut off hanging by a strip of skin
he said he knew it was the spirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine day
she a very religious woman he didnt but he died two year after so you see it was really true and ruby_gillis says
i ve had my doubts about that imagination of yours right along and if this is going to be the outcome of it i wont countenance any such doings
you ll go right over to diana_barry and you ll go through that spruce grove just for a lesson and a warning to you
anne_shirley interrupted miss_marilla_cuthbert firmly i never want to hear you talking in this fashion again and never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted wood again
anne_shirley might plead and cry as she liked and did for her terror was very real her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce grove in mortal dread after nightfall
she marched the shrinking ghost seer down to the spring and ordered her to proceed straightaway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of wailing lady and headless specters beyond
but miss_marilla_cuthbert was inexorable oh miss_marilla_cuthbert how can you be so cruel sobbed anne_shirley what would you feel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off
i ll risk it said miss_marilla_cuthbert unfeelingly you know i always mean what i say i ll cure you of imagining ghosts into place
march now anne_shirley marched that is she stumbled over the bridge and went shuddering up the horrible dim path beyond
the goblins of her fancy lurked in every shadow about her reaching out their cold fleshless hand to grasp the terrified small girl who had called them into being
a white strip of birch bark blowing up from the hollow over the brown floor of the grove made her heart stand still
anne_shirley never forgot that walk bitterly did she repent the license she had given to her imagination the long drawn wail of two old boughs rubbing against each other brought out the perspiration in beads on her forehead
when she reached mr_william_bell field she fled across it as if pursued by an army of white thing and arrived at the diana_barry kitchen door so out of breath that she could hardly gasp out her request for the apron pattern
the swoop of bats in the darkness over her was as the wings of unearthly creatures diana_barry was away so that she had no excuse to linger
anne_shirley went back over it with shut eye preferring to take the risk of dashing her brains out among the boughs to that of seeing a white thing
the dreadful return journey had to be faced when she finally stumbled over the log bridge she drew one long shivering breath of relief
well so nothing caught you said miss_marilla_cuthbert unsympathetically oh mar miss_marilla_cuthbert chattered anne_shirley i ll b be contt tented with c commonplace place after this
a new departure in flavorings dear me there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world as mrs_rachel_lynde says remarked anne_shirley plaintively putting her slate and book down on the kitchen table on the last day of june and wiping her red eye with a very damp handkerchief
chapter xxi wasnt it fortunate miss_marilla_cuthbert that i took an extra handkerchief to school today i had a presentiment that it would be needed
i never thought you were so fond of mr_phillips that you require two handkerchiefs to dry your tear just because he was going away said miss_marilla_cuthbert
i dont think i was crying because i was really so very fond of him reflected anne_shirley i just cried because all the others did
ruby_gillis has always declared she hated mr_phillips but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she burst into tear
it was ruby_gillis started it then all the girl began to cry one after the other i tried to hold out miss_marilla_cuthbert
i tried to remember the time mr_phillips made me sit with gil with a boy and the time he spelled my name without an on the blackboard and how he said i was the worst dunce he ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling and all the time he had been so horrid and sarcastic but somehow i couldnt miss_marilla_cuthbert and i just had to cry too
jane_andrews has been talking for a month about how glad she be when mr_phillips went away and she declared she never shed a tear
well she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a handkerchief from her brother of course the boy didnt cry because she hadnt brought one of her own not expecting to need it
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert it was heartrending mr_phillips made such a beautiful farewell speech beginning the time has come for us to part
oh i felt dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the time i talked in school and drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and prissy_andrews
it was very affecting and he had tear in his eye too miss_marilla_cuthbert i can tell you i wished i been a model pupil like minnie andrews
carrie sloane kept saying every few minute the time has come for us to part and that would start us off again whenever we were in any danger of cheering up
she hadnt anything on her conscience the girl cried all the way home from school i do feel dreadfully sad miss_marilla_cuthbert
but one cant feel quite in the depths of despair with two months vacation before them can they miss_marilla_cuthbert and besides we met the new minister and his wife coming from the station
for all i was feeling so bad about mr_phillips going away i couldnt help taking a little interest in a new minister could i
not exactly regally lovely of course it wouldnt do i suppose for a minister to have a regally lovely wife because it might set a bad example
his wife is very pretty mrs_rachel_lynde says the minister wife over at newbridge sets a very bad example because she dress so fashionably
jane_andrews said she thought puffed sleeve were too worldly for a minister wife but i didnt make any such uncharitable remark miss_marilla_cuthbert because i know what it is to long for puffed sleeve
our new minister wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeve and a hat trimmed with roses besides she only been a minister wife for a little while so one should make allowances shouldnt they
if miss_marilla_cuthbert in going down to mrs_rachel_lynde that evening was actuated by any motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had borrowed the preceding winter it was an amiable weakness shared by most of the avonlea people
many a thing mrs_rachel_lynde had lent sometimes never expecting to see it again came home that night in charge of the borrowers thereof
a new minister and moreover a minister with a wife was a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement where sensations were few and far between
they are going to board with mrs_rachel_lynde until the manse is ready old mr bentley the minister whom anne_shirley had found lacking in imagination had been pastor of avonlea for eighteen year
he was a widower when he came and a widower he remained despite the fact that gossip regularly married him to this that or the other one every year of his sojourn
in the preceding february he had resigned his charge and departed amid the regrets of his people most of whom had the affection born of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his shortcomings as an orator
since then the avonlea church had enjoyed a variety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various candidates and supplies who came sunday after sunday to preach on trial
these stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mother in israel but a certain small red haired girl who sat meekly in the corner of the old miss_marilla_cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and discussed the same in full with matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert always declining from principle to criticize minister in any shape or form
mrs_rachel_lynde says his delivery was so poor but i think his worst fault was just like mr bentley he had no imagination
and mr terry had too much he let it run away with him just as i did mine in the matter of the haunted wood
i dont think mr smith would have done matthew_cuthbert was anne_shirley final summing up besides mrs_rachel_lynde says his theology wasnt sound
mr gresham was a very good man and a very religious man but he told too many funny story and made the people laugh in church
i thought mr marshall was decidedly attractive but mrs_rachel_lynde says he isnt married or even engaged because she made special inquiries about him and she says it would never do to have a young unmarried minister in avonlea because he might marry in the congregation and that would make trouble
he was undignified and you must have some dignity about a minister mustnt you matthew_cuthbert mrs_rachel_lynde is a very farseeing woman isnt she matthew_cuthbert
i liked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he meant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it
mrs_rachel_lynde says he isnt perfect but she says she supposes we couldnt expect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year and anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly on all the points of doctrine
i very glad they ve called mr_allan and she knows his wife people and they are most respectable and the woman are all good housekeepers
mrs_rachel_lynde says that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman make an ideal combination for a minister family
the new minister and his wife were a young pleasant faced couple still on their honeymoon and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for their chosen lifework
old and young liked the frank cheerful young man with his high ideals and the bright gentle little lady who assumed the mistress ship of the manse
avonlea opened its heart to them from the start with mrs_allan anne_shirley fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love she had discovered another kindred spirit
mrs_allan is perfectly lovely she announced one sunday afternoon she taken our class and she a splendid teacher
she said right away she didnt think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions and you know miss_marilla_cuthbert that is exactly what i ve always thought
she said we could ask her any question we liked and i asked ever so many i good at asking questions miss_marilla_cuthbert
i believe you was miss_marilla_cuthbert emphatic comment nobody else asked any except ruby_gillis and she asked if there was to be a sunday school picnic this summer
i didnt think that was a very proper question to ask because it hadnt any connection with the lesson the lesson was about daniel in the lions den but mrs_allan just smiled and said she thought there would be
mrs_allan has a lovely smile she has such exquisite dimples in her cheeks i wish i had dimples in my cheeks miss_marilla_cuthbert
i not half so skinny as i was when i came here but i have no dimples yet if i had perhaps i could influence people for good
mrs_allan said we ought always to try to influence other people for good she talked so nice about everything i never knew before that religion was such a cheerful thing
i always thought it was kind of melancholy but mrs_allan isnt and i like to be a christian if i could be one like her
i wouldnt want to be one like mr superintendent mr_william_bell it very naughty of you to speak so about mr_william_bell said miss_marilla_cuthbert severely
mr_william_bell is a real good man oh of course he good agreed anne_shirley but he doesnt seem to get any comfort out of it
i suppose mrs_allan is too old to dance and sing and of course it wouldnt be dignified in a minister wife
if i could be good i dance and sing all day because i was glad of it but i can just feel she glad
she a christian and that she be one even if she could get to heaven without it i suppose we must have mr and mrs_allan up to tea someday soon said miss_marilla_cuthbert reflectively
but dont say a word to matthew_cuthbert about it for if he knew they were coming he find some excuse to be away that day
they ve been most everywhere but here let me see next wednesday would be a good time to have them he got so used to mr bentley
he didnt mind him but he going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new minister and a new minister wife will frighten him to death
i ll be as secret as the dead assured anne_shirley but oh miss_marilla_cuthbert will you let me make a cake for the occasion
i love to do something for mrs_allan and you know i can make a pretty good cake by this time
having the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important undertaking and miss_marilla_cuthbert was determined not to be eclipsed by any of the avonlea housekeepers
you can make a layer cake promised miss_marilla_cuthbert monday and tuesday great preparations went on at green gables anne_shirley was wild with excitement and delight
she talked it all over with diana_barry tuesday night in the twilight as they sat on the big red stones by the dryad bubble and made rainbows in the water with little twigs dipped in fir balsam
everything is ready diana_barry except my cake which i to make in the morning and the baking powder biscuits which miss_marilla_cuthbert will make just before teatime
i assure you diana_barry that miss_marilla_cuthbert and i have had a busy two day of it it such a responsibility having a minister family to tea
i never went through such an experience before you should just see our pantry it a sight to behold we re going to have jellied chicken and cold tongue
we re to have two kinds of jelly red and yellow and whipped cream and lemon pie and cherry pie and three kinds of cookies and fruit cake and miss_marilla_cuthbert famous yellow plum preserves that she keeps especially for minister and pound cake and layer cake and biscuits as aforesaid and new bread and old both in case the minister is dyspeptic and cant eat new
mrs_rachel_lynde says minister are dyspeptic but i dont think mr_allan has been a minister long enough for it to have had a bad effect on him
i dreamed last night that i was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a head
i just grow cold when i think of my layer cake oh diana_barry what if it shouldnt be good it ll be good all right assured diana_barry who was a very comfortable sort of friend
i sure that piece of the one you made that we had for lunch in idlewild two week ago was perfectly elegant
yes but cake have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just when you especially want them to be good sighed anne_shirley setting a particularly well balsamed twig afloat
however i suppose i shall just have to trust to providence and be careful to put in the flour
oh look diana_barry what a lovely rainbow do you suppose the dryad will come out after we go away and take it for a scarf
you know there is no such thing as a dryad said diana_barry diana mother had found out about the haunted wood and had been decidedly angry over it
as a result diana_barry had abstained from any further imitative flights of imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of belief even in harmless dryads
every night before i go to bed i look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really sitting here combing her locks with the spring for a mirror
but it so easy to imagine there is said anne_shirley sometimes i look for her footprints in the dew in the morning
oh diana_barry dont give up your faith in the dryad wednesday morning came anne_shirley got up at sunrise because she was too excited to sleep
she had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of her dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening but nothing short of absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary matter that morning
after breakfast she proceeded to make her cake when she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath
i sure i havent forgotten anything this time miss_marilla_cuthbert but do you think it will rise just suppose perhaps the baking powder isnt good
i used it out of the new can and mrs_rachel_lynde says you can never be sure of getting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated
mrs_rachel_lynde says the government ought to take the matter up but she says we ll never see the day when a tory government will do it
miss_marilla_cuthbert what if that cake doesnt rise we ll have plenty without it was miss_marilla_cuthbert unimpassioned way of looking at the subject
anne_shirley flushed with delight clapped it together with layers of ruby_gillis jelly and in imagination saw mrs_allan eating it and possibly asking for another piece
the cake did rise however and came out of the oven as light and feathery as golden foam you ll be using the best tea set of course miss_marilla_cuthbert she said
can i fix the table with ferns and wild roses i think that all nonsense sniffed miss_marilla_cuthbert in my opinion it the eatables that matter and not flummery decorations
mrs diana_barry had her table decorated said anne_shirley who was not entirely guiltless of the wisdom of the serpent and the minister paid her an elegant compliment
well do as you like said miss_marilla_cuthbert who was quite determined not to be surpassed by mrs diana_barry or anybody else
he said it was a feast for the eye as well as the palate only mind you leave enough room for the dishes and the food
having abundance of roses and ferns and a very artistic taste of her own she made that tea table such a thing of beauty
anne_shirley laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that should leave mrs diana_barry nowhere that when the minister and his wife sat down to it they exclaimed in chorus over it loveliness
it anne_shirley doings said miss_marilla_cuthbert grimly just and anne_shirley felt that mrs_allan approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world
he had been in such a state of shyness and nervousness that miss_marilla_cuthbert had given him up in despair but anne_shirley took him in hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes and white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly
matthew_cuthbert was there having been inveigled into the party only goodness and anne_shirley knew how he never said a word to mrs_allan but that perhaps was not to be expected
all went merry as a marriage mr_william_bell until anne_shirley layer cake was passed mrs_allan having already been helped to a bewildering variety declined it
but miss_marilla_cuthbert seeing the disappointment on anne_shirley face said smilingly oh you must take a piece of this mrs_allan anne_shirley made it on purpose for you
in that case i must sample it laughed mrs_allan helping herself to a plump triangle as did also the minister and miss_marilla_cuthbert
mrs_allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression crossed her face not a word did she say however but steadily ate away at it
miss_marilla_cuthbert saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake anne_shirley she exclaimed what on earth did you put into that cake
nothing but what the recipe said miss_marilla_cuthbert cried anne_shirley with a look of anguish oh isnt it all right
all right it simply horrible mr_allan dont try to eat it anne_shirley taste it yourself what flavoring did you use
vanilla said anne_shirley her face scarlet with mortification after tasting the cake only vanilla oh miss_marilla_cuthbert it must have been the baking powder
i had my suspicions of that bak baking powder fiddlesticks go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you used
anne_shirley fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially filled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly best vanilla
miss_marilla_cuthbert took it uncorked it smelled it mercy on us anne_shirley you ve flavored that cake with anodyne liniment
i broke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an old empty vanilla bottle i suppose it partly my fault i should have warned you but for pity sake why couldnt you have smelled it
and with this she fairly fled to the gable chamber where she cast herself on the bed and wept as one who refuses to be comforted
anne_shirley dissolved into tear under this double disgrace i couldnt i had such a cold presently a light step sounded on the stairs and somebody entered the room
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert sobbed anne_shirley without looking up i disgraced forever i shall never be able to live this down it will get out thing always do get out in avonlea
diana_barry will ask me how my cake turned out and i shall have to tell her the truth i shall always be pointed at as the girl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert if you have a spark of christian pity dont tell me that i must go down and wash the dishes after this
i ll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone but i cannot ever look mrs_allan in the face again
gil the boy in school will never get over laughing at it perhaps she ll think i tried to poison her mrs_rachel_lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried to poison her benefactor
but the liniment isnt poisonous it meant to be taken internally although not in cake wont you tell mrs_allan so miss_marilla_cuthbert
suppose you jump up and tell her so yourself said a merry voice anne_shirley flew up to find mrs_allan standing by her bed surveying her with laughing eye
my dear little girl you mustnt cry like this she said genuinely disturbed by anne_shirley tragic face why it all just a funny mistake that anybody might make
oh no it takes me to make such a mistake said anne_shirley forlornly and i wanted to have that cake so nice for you mrs_allan
yes i know dear and i assure you i appreciate your kindness and thoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right
now you mustnt cry any more but come down with me and show me your flower garden miss_marilla_cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own
anne_shirley permitted herself to be led down and comforted reflecting that it was really providential that mrs_allan was a kindred spirit
nothing more was said about the liniment cake and when the guests went away anne_shirley found that she had enjoyed the evening more than could have been expected considering that terrible incident
i want to see it for i very much interested in flower nevertheless she sighed deeply miss_marilla_cuthbert isnt it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistake in it yet
i ll warrant you ll make plenty in it said miss_marilla_cuthbert i never saw your beat for making mistake anne_shirley yes and well i know it admitted anne_shirley mournfully
but have you ever noticed one encouraging thing about me miss_marilla_cuthbert i never make the same mistake twice i dont know as that much benefit when you re always making new one
there must be a limit to the mistake one person can make and when i get to the end of them then i ll be through with them
oh dont you see miss_marilla_cuthbert that a very comforting thought well you better go and give that cake to the pigs said miss_marilla_cuthbert
it isnt fit for any human to eat not even jerry boute chapter xxii anne_shirley is invited out to tea and what are your eye popping out of your head about
now asked miss_marilla_cuthbert when anne_shirley had just come in from a run to the post office have you discovered another kindred spirit
she had come dancing up the lane like a wind blown sprite through the mellow sunshine and lazy shadows of the august evening
excitement hung around anne_shirley like a garment shone in her eye kindled in every feature no miss_marilla_cuthbert but oh what do you think
i am invited to tea at the manse tomorrow afternoon mrs_allan left the letter for me at the post office
just look at it miss_marilla_cuthbert miss anne_shirley green gables that is the first time i was ever called miss
mrs_allan told me she meant to have all the members of her sunday school class to tea in turn said miss_marilla_cuthbert regarding the wonderful event very coolly
such a thrill as it gave me i shall cherish it forever among my choicest treasures you neednt get in such a fever over it
do learn to take thing calmly child for anne_shirley to take thing calmly would have been to change her nature
all spirit and fire and dew as she was the pleasures and pains of life came to her with trebled intensity
miss_marilla_cuthbert felt this and was vaguely troubled over it realizing that the ups and downs of existence would probably bear hardly on this impulsive soul and not sufficiently understanding that the equally great capacity for delight might more than compensate
therefore miss_marilla_cuthbert conceived it to be her duty to drill anne_shirley into a tranquil uniformity of disposition as impossible and alien to her as to a dancing sunbeam in one of the brook shallows
she did not make much headway as she sorrowfully admitted to herself the downfall of some dear hope or plan plunged anne_shirley into deeps of affliction
miss_marilla_cuthbert had almost begun to despair of ever fashioning this waif of the world into her model little girl of demure manners and prim deportment
the fulfillment thereof exalted her to dizzy realms of delight neither would she have believed that she really liked anne_shirley much better as she was
anne_shirley went to bed that night speechless with misery because matthew_cuthbert had said the wind was round northeast and he feared it would be a rainy day tomorrow
the rustle of the poplar leaves about the house worried her it sounded so like pattering raindrops and the full faraway roar of the gulf to which she listened delightedly at other time loving its strange sonorous haunting rhythm now seemed like a prophecy of storm and disaster to a small maiden who particularly wanted a fine day
but all thing have an end even night before the day on which you are invited to take tea at the manse
anne_shirley thought that the morning would never come the morning in spite of matthew_cuthbert predictions was fine and anne_shirley spirit soared to their highest
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert there is something in me today that makes me just love everybody i see she exclaimed as she washed the breakfast dishes
you dont know how good i feel wouldnt it be nice if it could last i believe i could be a model child if i were just invited out to tea every day
you know i never had tea at a manse before and i not sure that i know all the rules of etiquette although i ve been studying the rules given in the etiquette department of the family herald ever since i came here
but oh miss_marilla_cuthbert it a solemn occasion too i feel so anxious what if i shouldnt behave properly i so afraid i ll do something silly or forget to do something i should do
would it be good manners to take a second helping of anything if you wanted to very much the trouble with you anne_shirley is that you re thinking too much about yourself
you should just think of mrs_allan and what would be nicest and most agreeable to her said miss_marilla_cuthbert hitting for once in her life on a very sound and pithy piece of advice
anne_shirley evidently got through her visit without any serious breach of etiquette for she came home through the twilight under a great high sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud in a beatified state of mind and told miss_marilla_cuthbert all about it happily sitting on the big red sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her tired curly head in miss_marilla_cuthbert gingham lap
a cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest field from the rims of firry western hill and whistling through the poplars
one clear star hung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in lover lane in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs
anne_shirley watched them as she talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were all tangled up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting
anne_shirley instantly realized this you are right miss_marilla_cuthbert i ll try not to think about myself at all oh miss_marilla_cuthbert i ve had a most fascinating time
i feel that i have not lived in vain and i shall always feel like that even if i should never be invited to tea at a manse again
she was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale pink organdy with dozens of frills and elbow sleeve and she looked just like a seraph
when i got there mrs_allan met me at the door i really think i like to be a minister wife when i grow up miss_marilla_cuthbert
a minister mightnt mind my red hair because he wouldnt be thinking of such worldly thing but then of course one would have to be naturally good
and i ll never be that so i suppose there no use in thinking about it some people are naturally good you know and others are not
i one of the others mrs_rachel_lynde says i full of original sin no matter how hard i try to be good
i can never make such a success of it as those who are naturally good it a good deal like geometry i expect
but dont you think the trying so hard ought to count for something mrs_allan is one of the naturally good people
i love her passionately you know there are some people like matthew_cuthbert and mrs_allan that you can love right off without any trouble
you know you ought to love them because they know so much and are such active workers in the church but you have to keep reminding yourself of it all the time or else you forget
and there are others like mrs_rachel_lynde that you have to try very hard to love there was another little girl at the manse to tea from the white sands sunday school
her name was laurette bradley and she was a very nice little girl not exactly a kindred spirit you know but still very nice
we had an elegant tea and i think i kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well after tea mrs_allan played and sang and she got lauretta and me to sing too
mrs_allan says i have a good voice and she says i must sing in the sunday school choir after this you cant think how i was thrilled at the mere thought
i ve longed so to sing in the sunday school choir as diana_barry does but i feared it was an honor i could never aspire to
lauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the white sands hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it
lauretta says that the americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in aid of the charlottetown hospital and they ask lot of the white sands people to recite
lauretta said she expected to be asked herself someday i just gazed at her in awe after she had gone mrs_allan and i had a heart to heart talk
i told her everything about mrs_thomas and the twins and katie maurice and violetta and coming to green gables and my trouble over geometry
and would you believe it miss_marilla_cuthbert mrs_allan told me she was a dunce at geometry too you dont know how that encouraged me
mrs_rachel_lynde came to the manse just before i left and what do you think miss_marilla_cuthbert the trustees have hired a new teacher and it a lady
her name is miss muriel miss_stacy isnt that a romantic name mrs_rachel_lynde says they ve never had a female teacher in avonlea before and she thinks it is a dangerous innovation
but i think it will be splendid to have a lady teacher and i really dont see how i going to live through the two week before school begins
anne_shirley comes to grief in an affair of honor anne_shirley had to live through more than two week as it happened
almost a month having elapsed since the liniment cake episode it was high time for her to get into fresh trouble of some sort little mistake such as absentmindedly emptying a pan of skim milk into a basket of yarn balls in the pantry instead of into the pigs bucket and walking clean over the edge of the log bridge into the brook while wrapped in imaginative reverie not really being worth counting
i so impatient to see her chapter xxiii a week after the tea at the manse diana_barry gave a party
they had a very good time and nothing untoward happened until after tea when they found themselves in the diana_barry garden a little tired of all their games and ripe for any enticing form of mischief which might present itself
small and select anne_shirley assured miss_marilla_cuthbert just the girl in our class this presently took the form of daring
it had begun among the boy but soon spread to the girl and all the silly thing that were done in avonlea that summer because the doers thereof were dared to do them would fill a book by themselves
first of all carrie sloane dared ruby_gillis to climb to a certain point in the huge old willow tree before the front door which ruby_gillis albeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said tree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eye if she should tear her new muslin dress nimbly did to the discomfiture of the aforesaid carrie sloane
then josie_pye dared jane_andrews to hop on her left leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her right foot to the ground which jane_andrews gamely tried to do but gave out at the third corner and had to confess herself defeated
josie_pye triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted anne_shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which bounded the garden to the east
now to walk board fences requires more skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose who has never tried it
but josie_pye if deficient in some qualities that make for popularity had at least a natural and inborn gift duly cultivated for walking board fences
josie_pye walked the diana_barry fence with an airy unconcern which seemed to imply that a little thing like that wasnt worth a dare
reluctant admiration greeted her exploit for most of the other girl could appreciate it having suffered many thing themselves in their efforts to walk fences
daring was the fashionable amusement among the avonlea small fry just then josie_pye descended from her perch flushed with victory and darted a defiant glance at anne_shirley
anne_shirley tossed her red braids i dont think it such a very wonderful thing to walk a little low board fence she said
i knew a girl in marysville who could walk the ridgepole of a roof i dont believe it said josie_pye flatly
i dont believe anybody could walk a ridgepole you couldnt anyhow couldnt i cried anne_shirley rashly then i dare you to do it said josie_pye defiantly
i dare you to climb up there and walk the ridgepole of mr diana_barry kitchen roof anne_shirley turned pale but there was clearly only one thing to be done
she walked toward the house where a ladder was leaning against the kitchen roof all the fifth class girl said oh partly in excitement partly in dismay
dont you do it anne_shirley entreated diana_barry you ll fall off and be killed never mind josie_pye it isnt fair to dare anybody to do anything so dangerous
i must do it my honor is at stake said anne_shirley solemnly i shall walk that ridgepole diana_barry or perish in the attempt
anne_shirley climbed the ladder amid breathless silence gained the ridgepole balanced herself uprightly on that precarious footing and started to walk along it
dizzily conscious that she was uncomfortably high up in the world and that walking ridgepoles was not a thing in which your imagination helped you out much
if i am killed you are to have my pearl bead ring nevertheless she managed to take several steps before the catastrophe came
then she swayed lost her balance stumbled staggered and fell sliding down over the sun baked roof and crashing off it through the tangle of virginia creeper beneath all before the dismayed circle below could give a simultaneous terrified shriek
if anne_shirley had tumbled off the roof on the side up which she had ascended diana_barry would probably have fallen heir to the pearl bead ring then and there
fortunately she fell on the other side where the roof extended down over the porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was a much less serious thing
nevertheless when diana_barry and the other girl had rushed frantically around the house except ruby_gillis who remained as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics they found anne_shirley lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the virginia creeper
anne_shirley are you killed shrieked diana_barry throwing herself on her knees beside her friend oh anne_shirley dear anne_shirley speak just one word to me and tell me if you re killed
to the immense relief of all the girl and especially of josie_pye who in spite of lack of imagination had been seized with horrible visions of a future branded as the girl who was the cause of anne_shirley early and tragic death anne_shirley sat dizzily up and answered uncertainly no diana_barry i am not killed but i think i am rendered unconscious
where sobbed carrie sloane oh where anne_shirley before anne_shirley could answer mrs diana_barry appeared on the scene
at sight of her anne_shirley tried to scramble to her feet but sank back again with a sharp little cry of pain
what the matter where have you hurt yourself demanded mrs diana_barry my ankle gasped anne_shirley oh diana_barry please find your father and ask him to take me home
i know i can never walk there and i sure i couldnt hop so far on one foot when jane_andrews couldnt even hop around the garden
miss_marilla_cuthbert was out in the orchard picking a panful of summer apple when she saw mr diana_barry coming over the log bridge and up the slope with mrs diana_barry beside him and a whole procession of little girl trailing after him
in his arms he carried anne_shirley whose head lay limply against his shoulder at that moment miss_marilla_cuthbert had a revelation
in the sudden stab of fear that pierced her very heart she realized what anne_shirley had come to mean to her
but now she knew as she hurried wildly down the slope that anne_shirley was dearer to her than anything else on earth
mr diana_barry what has happened to her she gasped more white and shaken than the self contained sensible miss_marilla_cuthbert had been for many year
she would have admitted that she liked anne_shirley nay that she was very fond of anne_shirley anne_shirley herself answered lifting her head
dont be very frightened miss_marilla_cuthbert i was walking the ridgepole and i fell off i expect i have sprained my ankle
i might have known you go and do something of the sort when i let you go to that party said miss_marilla_cuthbert sharp and shrewish in her very relief
but miss_marilla_cuthbert i might have broken my neck let us look on the bright side of thing bring her in here mr diana_barry and lay her on the sofa
mercy me the child has gone and fainted it was quite true overcome by the pain of her injury anne_shirley had one more of her wishes granted to her
matthew_cuthbert hastily summoned from the harvest field was straightway dispatched for the doctor who in due time came to discover that the injury was more serious than they had supposed
that night when miss_marilla_cuthbert went up to the east gable where a white faced girl was lying a plaintive voice greeted her from the bed
she had fainted dead away anne_shirley ankle was broken arent you very sorry for me miss_marilla_cuthbert it was your own fault said miss_marilla_cuthbert twitching down the blind and lighting a lamp
and that is just why you should be sorry for me said anne_shirley because the thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard
if i could blame it on anybody i would feel so much better but what would you have done miss_marilla_cuthbert if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole
i have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away such absurdity said miss_marilla_cuthbert anne_shirley sighed but you have such strength of mind miss_marilla_cuthbert
i havent i just felt that i couldnt bear josie_pye scorn she would have crowed over me all my life
and i think i have been punished so much that you neednt be very cross with me miss_marilla_cuthbert it not a bit nice to faint after all
and the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle i wont be able to go around for six or seven week
and i ll miss the new lady teacher she wont be new any more by the time i able to go to school
and gil everybody will get ahead of me in class oh i am an afflicted mortal but i ll try to bear it all bravely if only you wont be cross with me miss_marilla_cuthbert
there there i not cross said miss_marilla_cuthbert you re an unlucky child there no doubt about that but as you say you ll have the suffering of it
here now try and eat some supper isnt it fortunate i ve got such an imagination said anne_shirley it will help me through splendidly i expect
what do people who havent any imagination do when they break their bones do you suppose miss_marilla_cuthbert anne_shirley had good reason to bless her imagination many a time and oft during the tedious seven week that followed
she had many visitors and not a day passed without one or more of the schoolgirls dropping in to bring her flower and book and tell her all the happenings in the juvenile world of avonlea
everybody has been so good and kind miss_marilla_cuthbert sighed anne_shirley happily on the day when she could first limp across the floor
but she was not solely dependent on it it isnt very pleasant to be laid up but there is a bright side to it miss_marilla_cuthbert
you find out how many friend you have why even superintendent mr_william_bell came to see me and he really a very fine man
i believe now he really does mean them only he has got into the habit of saying them as if he didnt
not a kindred spirit of course but still i like him and i awfully sorry i ever criticized his prayer he could get over that if he take a little trouble
i gave him a good broad hint i told him how hard i tried to make my own little private prayer interesting
he told me all about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy it does seem so strange to think of superintendent mr_william_bell ever being a boy
when i try to imagine him as a boy i see him with gray whiskers and spectacles just as he look in sunday school only small
even my imagination has its limits for i cant imagine that now it so easy to imagine mrs_allan as a little girl
mrs_allan has been to see me fourteen time isnt that something to be proud of miss_marilla_cuthbert when a minister wife has so many claims on her time
she is such a cheerful person to have visit you too she never tells you it your own fault and she hopes you ll be a better girl on account of it
mrs_rachel_lynde always told me that when she came to see me and she said it in a kind of way that made me feel she might hope i be a better girl but didnt really believe i would
even josie_pye came to see me i received her as politely as i could because i think she was sorry
she dared me to walk a ridgepole if i had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden of remorse all her life
but oh i shall be so glad when i can go to school for i ve heard such exciting thing about the new teacher
diana_barry has been a faithful friend she been over every day to cheer my lonely pillow the girl all think she is perfectly sweet
diana_barry says she has the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eye she dress beautifully and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else in avonlea
every other friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody has to say a piece or take part in a dialogue oh it just glorious to think of it
josie_pye says she hates it but that is just because josie_pye has so little imagination diana_barry and ruby_gillis and jane_andrews are preparing a dialogue called a morning visit for next friday
and the friday afternoon they dont have recitations miss_stacy takes them all to the wood for a field day and they study ferns and flower and birds
and they have physical culture exercises every morning and evening mrs_rachel_lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all comes of having a lady teacher
but i think it must be splendid and i believe i shall find that miss_stacy is a kindred spirit
there one thing plain to be seen anne_shirley said miss_marilla_cuthbert and that is that your fall off the diana_barry roof hasnt injured your tongue at all
was october again when anne_shirley was ready to go back to school a glorious october all red and gold with mellow morning when the valleys were filled with delicate mists as if the spirit of autumn had poured them in for the sun to drain amethyst pearl silver rose and smoke blue
the dews were so heavy that the field glistened like cloth of silver and there were such heaps of rustling leaves in the hollows of many stemmed wood to run crisply through
chapter xxiv miss_stacy and her pupils get up a concert it the birch path was a canopy of yellow and the ferns were sear and brown all along it
there was a tang in the very air that inspired the heart of small maidens tripping unlike snails swiftly and willingly to school and it was jolly to be back again at the little brown desk beside diana_barry with ruby_gillis nodding across the aisle and
carrie sloane sending up notes and julia mr_william_bell passing a chew of gum down from the back seat anne_shirley drew a long breath of happiness as she sharpened her pencil and arranged her picture cards in her desk
miss_stacy was a bright sympathetic young woman with the happy gift of winning and holding the affections of her pupils and bringing out the best that was in them mentally and morally
anne_shirley expanded like a flower under this wholesome influence and carried home to the admiring matthew_cuthbert and the critical miss_marilla_cuthbert glowing accounts of schoolwork and aims
life was certainly very interesting in the new teacher she found another true and helpful friend i love miss_stacy with my whole heart miss_marilla_cuthbert
she is so ladylike and she has such a sweet voice when she pronounces my name i feel instinctively that she spelling it with an
we had recitations this afternoon i just wish you could have been there to hear me recite mary queen of scots
ruby_gillis told me coming home that the way i said the line now for my father arm she said my woman heart farewell just made her blood run cold
i just put my whole soul into it well now you might recite it for me some of these day out in the barn suggested matthew_cuthbert
it wont be so exciting as it is when you have a whole schoolful before you hanging breathlessly on your word
of course i will said anne_shirley meditatively but i wont be able to do it so well i know i know i wont be able to make your blood run cold
mrs_rachel_lynde says it made her blood run cold to see the boy climbing to the very tops of those big tree on mr_william_bell hill after crows nests last friday said miss_marilla_cuthbert
i wonder at miss_stacy for encouraging it but we wanted a crow nest for nature study explained anne_shirley
that was on our field afternoon field afternoon are splendid miss_marilla_cuthbert and miss_stacy explains everything so beautifully we have to write compositions on our field afternoon and i write the best one
it very vain of you to say so then you better let your teacher say it but she did say it miss_marilla_cuthbert
and indeed i not vain about it how can i be when i such a dunce at geometry although i really beginning to see through it a little too
miss_stacy makes it so clear still i ll never be good at it and i assure you it is a humbling reflection
mostly miss_stacy lets us choose our own subjects but next week we are to write a composition on some remarkable person
but i love writing compositions it hard to choose among so many remarkable people who have lived mustnt it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after you re dead
i think when i grow up i ll be a trained nurse and go with the red crosses to the field of battle as a messenger of mercy
that would be very romantic but one would have to be very good to be a missionary and that would be a stumbling block
oh i would dearly love to be remarkable that is if i dont go out as a foreign missionary we have physical culture exercises every day too
but all the field afternoon and recitation fridays and physical culture contortions paled before a project which miss_stacy brought forward in november
this was that the scholars of avonlea school should get up a concert and hold it in the hall on christmas night for the laudable purpose of helping to pay for a schoolhouse flag
they make you graceful and promote digestion promote fiddlesticks said miss_marilla_cuthbert who honestly thought it was all nonsense the pupils one and all taking graciously to this plan the preparations for a program were begun at once
and of all the excited performers elect none was so excited as anne_shirley who threw herself into the undertaking heart and soul hampered as she was by miss_marilla_cuthbert disapproval
it just filling your head up with nonsense and taking time that ought to be put on your lesson she grumbled
miss_marilla_cuthbert thought it all rank foolishness i dont approve of child getting up concert and racing about to practices
it makes them vain and forward and fond of gadding but think of the worthy object pleaded anne_shirley
a flag will cultivate a spirit of patriotism miss_marilla_cuthbert fudge there precious little patriotism in the thoughts of any of you
all you want is a good time well when you can combine patriotism and fun isnt it all right
of course it real nice to be getting up a concert we re going to have six choruses and diana_barry is to sing a solo
i in two dialogues the society for the suppression of gossip and the fairy queen the boy are going to have a dialogue too
and i to have two recitations miss_marilla_cuthbert i just tremble when i think of it but it a nice thrilly kind of tremble
and we re to have a tableau at the last faith hope and charity diana_barry and ruby_gillis and i are to be in it all draped in white with flowing hair
i to be hope with my hand clasped so and my eye uplifted i going to practice my recitations in the garret
i have to groan heartrendingly in one of them and it really hard to get up a good artistic groan miss_marilla_cuthbert
dont be alarmed if you hear me groaning josie_pye is sulky because she didnt get the part she wanted in the dialogue
she wanted to be the fairy queen that would have been ridiculous for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as josie_pye
fairy queens must be slender jane_andrews is to be the queen and i am to be one of her maids of honor
josie_pye says she thinks a red haired fairy is just as ridiculous as a fat one but i do not let myself mind what josie_pye says
i to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and ruby_gillis is going to lend me her slippers because i havent any of my own
it necessary for fairies to have slippers you know you couldnt imagine a fairy wearing boots could you especially with copper toes
and we are all to march in two by two after the audience is seated while emma white plays a march on the organ
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert i know you are not so enthusiastic about it as i am but dont you hope your little anne_shirley will distinguish herself
we are going to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with pink tissue paper roses in them all i hope is that you ll behave yourself
i ll be heartily glad when all this fuss is over and you ll be able to settle down you are simply good for nothing just now with your head stuffed full of dialogues and groans and tableaus
anne_shirley sighed and betook herself to the back yard over which a young new moon was shining through the leafless poplar boughs from an apple green western sky and where matthew_cuthbert was splitting wood
anne_shirley perched herself on a block and talked the concert over with him sure of an appreciative and sympathetic listener in this instance at least
as for your tongue it a marvel it not clean worn out well now i reckon it going to be a pretty good concert
and i expect you ll do your part fine he said smiling down into her eager vivacious little face anne_shirley smiled back at him
those two were the best of friend and matthew_cuthbert thanked his stars many a time and oft that he had nothing to do with bringing her up
that was miss_marilla_cuthbert exclusive duty if it had been his he would have been worried over frequent conflicts between inclination and said duty
but it was not such a bad arrangement after all a little appreciation sometimes does quite as much good as all the conscientious bringing up in the world
as it was he was free to spoil anne_shirley miss_marilla_cuthbert phrasing as much as he liked chapter xxv matthew_cuthbert insists on puffed sleeve matthew_cuthbert was having a bad ten minute of it
he had come into the kitchen in the twilight of a cold gray december evening and had sat down in the woodbox corner to take off his heavy boots unconscious of the fact that anne_shirley and a bevy of her schoolmates were having a practice of the fairy queen in the sitting room
they did not see matthew_cuthbert who shrank bashfully back into the shadows beyond the woodbox with a boot in one hand and a bootjack in the other and he watched them shyly for the aforesaid ten minute as they put on caps and jackets and talked about the dialogue and the concert
anne_shirley stood among them bright eyed and animated as they but matthew_cuthbert suddenly became conscious that there was something about her different from her mates
presently they came trooping through the hall and out into the kitchen laughing and chattering gaily and what worried matthew_cuthbert was that the difference impressed him as being something that should not exist
anne_shirley had a brighter face and bigger starrier eye and more delicate features than the other even shy unobservant matthew_cuthbert had learned to take note of these thing but the difference that disturbed him did not consist in any of these respects
then in what did it consist matthew_cuthbert was haunted by this question long after the girl had gone arm in arm down the long hard frozen lane
he could not refer it to miss_marilla_cuthbert who he felt would be quite sure to sniff scornfully and remark that the only difference she saw between anne_shirley and the other girl was that they sometimes kept their tongues quiet while anne_shirley never did
and anne_shirley had betaken herself to her book this matthew_cuthbert felt would be no great help he had recourse to his pipe that evening to help him study it out much to miss_marilla_cuthbert disgust
after two hour of smoking and hard reflection matthew_cuthbert arrived at a solution of his problem anne_shirley was not dressed like the other girl
the more matthew_cuthbert thought about the matter the more he was convinced that anne_shirley never had been dressed like the other girl never since she had come to green gables
miss_marilla_cuthbert kept her clothed in plain dark dress all made after the same unvarying pattern if matthew_cuthbert knew there was such a thing as fashion in dress
it was as much as he did but he was quite sure that anne_shirley sleeve did not look at all like the sleeve the other girl wore
he recalled the cluster of little girl he had seen around her that evening all gay in waists of red and blue and pink and white and he wondered why miss_marilla_cuthbert always kept her so plainly and soberly gowned
of course it must be all right miss_marilla_cuthbert knew best and miss_marilla_cuthbert was bringing her up probably some wise inscrutable motive was to be served thereby
matthew_cuthbert decided that he would give her one that surely could not be objected to as an unwarranted putting in of his oar
but surely it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty dress something like diana_barry always wore christmas was only a fortnight off
matthew_cuthbert with a sigh of satisfaction put away his pipe and went to bed while miss_marilla_cuthbert opened all the door and aired the house
the very next evening matthew_cuthbert betook himself to carmody to buy the dress determined to get the worst over and have done with it
a nice new dress would be the very thing for a present it would be he felt assured no trifling ordeal
there were some thing matthew_cuthbert could buy and prove himself no mean bargainer but he knew he would be at the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl dress
to be sure the cuthberts always had gone to william blair it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them as to attend the presbyterian church and vote conservative
after much cogitation matthew_cuthbert resolved to go to samuel lawson store instead of william blair but william blair two daughters frequently waited on customers there and matthew_cuthbert held them in absolute dread
he could contrive to deal with them when he knew exactly what he wanted and could point it out but in such a matter as this requiring explanation and consultation matthew_cuthbert felt that he must be sure of a man behind the counter
matthew_cuthbert did not know that samuel in the recent expansion of his business had set up a lady clerk also she was a niece of his wife and a very dashing young person indeed with a huge drooping pompadour big rolling brown eye and a most extensive and bewildering smile
she was dressed with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets that glittered and rattled and tinkled with every movement of her hand
matthew_cuthbert was covered with confusion at finding her there at all and those bangles completely wrecked his wits at one fell swoop
so he would go to lawson where samuel or his son would wait on him alas what can i do for you this evening mr miss_marilla_cuthbert
miss lucilla harris inquired briskly and ingratiatingly tapping the counter with both hand have you any any any well now say any garden rakes stammered matthew_cuthbert
miss harris looked somewhat surprised as well she might to hear a man inquiring for garden rakes in the middle of december
i believe we have one or two left over she said but they re upstairs in the lumber room i ll go and see
during her absence matthew_cuthbert collected his scattered senses for another effort when miss harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired anything else tonight mr miss_marilla_cuthbert
matthew_cuthbert took his courage in both hand and replied well now since you suggest it i might as well take that is look at buy some some hayseed
miss harris had heard matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert called odd she now concluded that he was entirely crazy we only keep hayseed in the spring she explained loftily
we ve none on hand just now oh certainly certainly just as you say stammered unhappy matthew_cuthbert seizing the rake and making for the door
at the threshold he recollected that he had not paid for it and he turned miserably back while miss harris was counting out his change he rallied his powers for a final desperate attempt
well now if it isnt too much trouble i might as well that is i like to look at at some sugar white or brown queried miss harris patiently
oh well now brown said matthew_cuthbert feebly there a barrel of it over there said miss harris shaking her bangles at it
it the only kind we have i ll i ll take twenty pounds of it said matthew_cuthbert with beads of perspiration standing on his forehead
it had been a gruesome experience but it served him right he thought for committing the heresy of going to a strange store
matthew_cuthbert had driven halfway home before he was his own man again when he reached home he hid the rake in the tool house but the sugar he carried in to miss_marilla_cuthbert
brown sugar exclaimed miss_marilla_cuthbert whatever possessed you to get so much you know i never use it except for the hired man porridge or black fruit cake
jerry gone and i ve made my cake long ago it not good sugar either it coarse and dark william blair doesnt usually keep sugar like that
i i thought it might come in handy sometime said matthew_cuthbert making good his escape when matthew_cuthbert came to think the matter over he decided that a woman was required to cope with the situation
miss_marilla_cuthbert was out of the question matthew_cuthbert felt sure she would throw cold water on his project at once remained only mrs_rachel_lynde for of no other woman in avonlea would matthew_cuthbert have dared to ask advice
to mrs_rachel_lynde he went accordingly and that good lady promptly took the matter out of the harassed man hand
pick out a dress for you to give anne_shirley to be sure i will i going to carmody tomorrow and i ll attend to it
have you something particular in mind no well i ll just go by my own judgment then i believe a nice rich brown would just suit anne_shirley and william blair has some new gloria in
perhaps you like me to make it up for her too seeing that if miss_marilla_cuthbert was to make it anne_shirley would probably get wind of it before the time and spoil the surprise
i ll make it to fit my niece jenny ruby_gillis for she and anne_shirley are as like as two peas as far as figure goes
that real pretty well i ll do it no it isnt a mite of trouble i like sewing well now i much obliged said matthew_cuthbert and
and i dunno but i like i think they make the sleeve different nowadays to what they used to be if it wouldnt be asking too much i i like them made in the new way
puffs of course you neednt worry a speck more about it matthew_cuthbert i ll make it up in the very latest fashion said mrs_rachel_lynde
to herself she added when matthew_cuthbert had gone it ll be a real satisfaction to see that poor child wearing something decent for once
the way miss_marilla_cuthbert dress her is positively ridiculous that what and i ve ached to tell her so plainly a dozen time
i ve held my tongue though for i can see miss_marilla_cuthbert doesnt want advice and she thinks she knows more about bringing child up than i do for all
folks that has brought up child know that there no hard and fast method in the world that ll suit every child
but them as never have think it all as plain and easy as rule of three just set your three terms down so fashion and the sum ll work out correct
she an old maid but that always the way but flesh and blood dont come under the head of arithmetic and that where miss_marilla_cuthbert makes her mistake
i suppose she trying to cultivate a spirit of humility in anne_shirley by dressing her as she does but it more likely to cultivate envy and discontent
i sure the child must feel the difference between her clothes and the other girl but to think of matthew_cuthbert taking notice of it
miss_marilla_cuthbert knew all the following fortnight that matthew_cuthbert had something on his mind but what it was she could not guess until christmas eve when mrs_rachel_lynde brought up the new dress
miss_marilla_cuthbert behaved pretty well on the whole although it is very likely she distrusted mrs_rachel_lynde diplomatic explanation that she had made the dress because matthew_cuthbert was afraid anne_shirley would find out about it too soon if miss_marilla_cuthbert made it
so this is what matthew_cuthbert has been looking so mysterious over and grinning about to himself for two week is it
that man is waking up after being asleep for over sixty year she said a little stiffly but tolerantly
i knew he was up to some foolishness well i must say i dont think anne_shirley needed any more dress
i made her three good warm serviceable one this fall and anything more is sheer extravagance there enough material in those sleeve alone to make a waist i declare there is
you ll just pamper anne_shirley vanity matthew_cuthbert and she as vain as a peacock now well i hope she ll be satisfied at last
for i know she been hankering after those silly sleeve ever since they came in although she never said a word after the first
the puffs have been getting bigger and more ridiculous right along they re as big as balloons now next year anybody who wears them will have to go through a door sideways
it had been a very mild december and people had looked forward to a green christmas but just enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure avonlea
the firs in the haunted wood were all feathery and wonderful the birches and wild cherry tree were outlined in pearl the plowed field were stretches of snowy dimples and there was a crisp tang in the air that was glorious
christmas morning broke on a beautiful white world anne_shirley peeped out from her frosted gable window with delighted eye anne_shirley ran downstairs singing until her voice reechoed through green gables
merry christmas miss_marilla_cuthbert merry christmas matthew_cuthbert isnt it a lovely christmas i so glad it white any other kind of christmas doesnt seem real does it
i dont like green christmases they re not green they re just nasty faded browns and grays what makes people call them green why why matthew_cuthbert is that for me
matthew_cuthbert had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and held it out with a deprecatory glance at miss_marilla_cuthbert who feigned to be contemptuously filling the teapot but nevertheless watched the scene out of the corner of her eye with a rather interested air
oh how pretty it was a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk a skirt with dainty frills and shirrings a waist elaborately pintucked in the most fashionable way with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck
oh matthew_cuthbert anne_shirley took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence but the sleeve they were the crowning glory
long elbow cuffs and above them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of brown silk ribbon that a christmas present for you anne_shirley said matthew_cuthbert shyly
why why anne_shirley dont you like it well now well now for anne_shirley eye had suddenly filled with tear like it
oh matthew_cuthbert anne_shirley laid the dress over a chair and clasped her hand matthew_cuthbert it perfectly exquisite oh i can never thank you enough
look at those sleeve oh it seems to me this must be a happy dream well well let us have breakfast interrupted miss_marilla_cuthbert
i must say anne_shirley i dont think you needed the dress but since matthew_cuthbert has got it for you see that you take good care of it
there a hair ribbon mrs_rachel_lynde left for you it brown to match the dress come now sit in i dont see how i going to eat breakfast said anne_shirley rapturously
breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment i rather feast my eye on that dress i so glad that puffed sleeve are still fashionable
it did seem to me that i never get over it if they went out before i had a dress with them
i never have felt quite satisfied you see it was lovely of mrs_rachel_lynde to give me the ribbon too i feel that i ought to be a very good girl indeed
it at time like this i sorry i not a model little girl and i always resolve that i will be in future
but somehow it hard to carry out your resolutions when irresistible temptations come still i really will make an extra effort after this
when the commonplace breakfast was over diana_barry appeared crossing the white log bridge in the hollow a gay little figure in her crimson ulster
anne_shirley flew down the slope to meet her merry christmas diana_barry and oh it a wonderful christmas i ve something splendid to show you
matthew_cuthbert has given me the loveliest dress with such sleeve i couldnt even imagine any nicer i ve got something more for you said diana_barry breathlessly
here this box aunt miss_josephine_barry sent us out a big box with ever so many thing in it and this is for you
i have brought it over last night but it didnt come until after dark and i never feel very comfortable coming through the haunted wood in the dark now
first a card with for the anne_shirley girl and merry christmas written on it and then a pair of the daintiest little kid slippers with beaded toes and satin bows and glistening buckles
anne_shirley opened the box and peeped in oh said anne_shirley diana_barry this is too much i must be dreaming
you wont have to borrow ruby_gillis slippers now and that a blessing for they re two sizes too big for you and it would be awful to hear a fairy shuffling
i call it providential said diana_barry josie_pye would be delighted mind you rob wright went home with gertie josie_pye from the practice night before last
all the avonlea scholars were in a fever of excitement that day for the hall had to be decorated and a last grand rehearsal held
did you ever hear anything equal to that the concert came off in the evening and was a pronounced success
the little hall was crowded all the performers did excellently well but anne_shirley was the bright particular star of the occasion as even envy in the shape of josie_pye dared not deny
sighed anne_shirley when it was all over and she and diana_barry were walking home together under a dark starry sky
oh hasnt it been a brilliant evening everything went off very well said diana_barry practically i guess we must have made as much as ten dollars
mind you mr_allan is going to send an account of it to the charlottetown papers oh diana_barry will we really see our name in print
it makes me thrill to think of it your solo was perfectly elegant diana_barry i felt prouder than you did when it was encored
i just said to myself it is my dear bosom friend who is so honored well your recitations just brought down the house anne_shirley
that sad one was simply splendid oh i was so nervous diana_barry when mr_allan called out my name i really cannot tell how i ever got up on that platform
i felt as if a million eye were looking at me and through me and for one dreadful moment i was sure i couldnt begin at all
then i thought of my lovely puffed sleeve and took courage i knew that i must live up to those sleeve diana_barry
so i started in and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so far away i just felt like a parrot
it providential that i practiced those recitations so often up in the garret or i never have been able to get through
did i groan all right yes indeed you groaned lovely assured diana_barry i saw old mrs sloane wiping away tear when i sat down
it was splendid to think i had touched somebody heart it so romantic to take part in a concert isnt it
oh it been a very memorable occasion indeed wasnt the boy dialogue fine said diana_barry gilbert_blythe was just splendid
anne_shirley i do think it awful mean the way you treat gil wait till i tell you when you ran off the platform after the fairy dialogue one of your roses fell out of your hair
i saw gil pick it up and put it in his breast pocket there now you re so romantic that i sure you ought to be pleased at that
it nothing to me what that person does said anne_shirley loftily i simply never waste a thought on him diana_barry
that night miss_marilla_cuthbert and matthew_cuthbert who had been out to a concert for the first time in twenty year sat for a while by the kitchen fire after anne_shirley had gone to bed
well now i guess our anne_shirley did as well as any of them said matthew_cuthbert proudly yes she did admitted miss_marilla_cuthbert
she a bright child matthew_cuthbert and she looked real nice too i ve been kind of opposed to this concert scheme but i suppose there no real harm in it after all
anyhow i was proud of anne_shirley tonight although i not going to tell her so well now i was proud of her
and i did tell her so fore she went upstairs said matthew_cuthbert we must see what we can do for her some of these day miss_marilla_cuthbert
i guess she ll need something more than avonlea school by and by there time enough to think of that said miss_marilla_cuthbert
she only thirteen in march though tonight it struck me she was growing quite a big girl mrs_rachel_lynde made that dress a mite too long and it makes anne_shirley look so tall
and i guess the best thing we can do for her will be to send her to queen after a spell
she quick to learn but nothing need be said about that for a year or two yet well now it ll do no harm to be thinking it over off and on said matthew_cuthbert
thing like that are all the better for lot of thinking over chapter xxvi the story club is formed junior avonlea found it hard to settle down to humdrum existence again
to anne_shirley in particular thing seemed fearfully flat stale and unprofitable after the goblet of excitement she had been sipping for week
could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway day before the concert at first as she told diana_barry she did not really think she could
i positively certain diana_barry that life can never be quite the same again as it was in those olden day she said mournfully as if referring to a period of at least fifty year back
perhaps after a while i ll get used to it but i afraid concert spoil people for everyday life i suppose that is why miss_marilla_cuthbert disapproves of them
it must be a great deal better to be sensible but still i dont believe i really want to be a sensible person because they are so unromantic
miss_marilla_cuthbert is such a sensible woman mrs_rachel_lynde says there is no danger of my ever being one but you can never tell
i feel just now that i may grow up to be sensible yet but perhaps that is only because i tired
i simply couldnt sleep last night for ever so long i just lay awake and imagined the concert over and over again
that one splendid thing about such affairs it so lovely to look back to them eventually however avonlea school slipped back into its old groove and took up its old interests
ruby_gillis and emma white who had quarreled over a point of precedence in their platform seats no longer sat at the same desk and a promising friendship of three year was broken up
josie_pye and julia mr_william_bell did not speak for three months because josie_pye had told bessie wright that julia mr_william_bell bow when she got up to recite made her think of a chicken jerking its head and bessie told julia
none of the sloanes would have any dealings with the bells because the bells had declared that the sloanes had too much to do in the program and the sloanes had retorted that the bells were not capable of doing the little they had to do properly
finally charlie_sloane fought moody_spurgeon_macpherson because moody_spurgeon_macpherson had said that anne_shirley put on air about her recitations and moody_spurgeon_macpherson was licked consequently moody_spurgeon_macpherson sister ella may would not speak to anne_shirley all the rest of the winter
to be sure the concert left traces with the exception of these trifling frictions work in miss_stacy little kingdom went on with regularity and smoothness
it was an unusually mild winter with so little snow that anne_shirley and diana_barry could go to school nearly every day by way of the birch path
on anne_shirley birthday they were tripping lightly down it keeping eye and ears alert amid all their chatter for miss_stacy had told them that they must soon write a composition on a winter walk in the wood and it behooved them to be observant
the winter week slipped by just think diana_barry i thirteen year old today remarked anne_shirley in an awed voice
i can scarcely realize that i in my teens when i woke this morning it seemed to me that everything must be different
you ve been thirteen for a month so i suppose it doesnt seem such a novelty to you as it does to me
it makes life seem so much more interesting in two more year i ll be really grown up it a great comfort to think that i ll be able to use big word then without being laughed at
ruby_gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as she fifteen said diana_barry ruby_gillis thinks of nothing but beaus said anne_shirley disdainfully
she actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a take notice for all she pretends to be so mad
mrs_allan says we should never make uncharitable speeches but they do slip out so often before you think dont they
but i afraid that is an uncharitable speech i simply cant talk about josie_pye without making an uncharitable speech so i never mention her at all
you may have noticed that i trying to be as much like mrs_allan as i possibly can for i think she perfect
mr_allan thinks so too mrs_rachel_lynde says he just worships the ground she treads on and she doesnt really think it right for a minister to set his affections so much on a mortal being
but then diana_barry even minister are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody else i had such an interesting talk with mrs_allan about besetting sins last sunday afternoon
there are just a few thing it proper to talk about on sundays and that is one of them my besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my duties
i striving very hard to overcome it and now that i really thirteen perhaps i ll get on better in four more year we ll be able to put our hair up said diana_barry
alice mr_william_bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up but i think that ridiculous i shall wait until i seventeen
if i had alice mr_william_bell crooked nose said anne_shirley decidedly i wouldnt but there i wont say what i was going to because it was extremely uncharitable
besides i was comparing it with my own nose and that vanity i afraid i think too much about my nose ever since i heard that compliment about it long ago
it really is a great comfort to me oh diana_barry look there a rabbit that something to remember for our wood composition
i really think the wood are just as lovely in winter as in summer they re so white and still as if they were asleep and dreaming pretty dream
i wont mind writing that composition when its time comes sighed diana_barry i can manage to write about the wood but the one we re to hand in monday is terrible
the idea of miss_stacy telling us to write a story out of our own head why it as easy as wink said anne_shirley
it easy for you because you have an imagination retorted diana_barry but what would you do if you had been born without one
i suppose you have your composition all done anne_shirley nodded trying hard not to look virtuously complacent and failing miserably
i wrote it last monday evening it called the jealous rival or in death not divided i read it to miss_marilla_cuthbert and she said it was stuff and nonsense
then i read it to matthew_cuthbert and he said it was fine that is the kind of critic i like it a sad sweet story
it about two beautiful maidens called lady_cordelia_fitzgerald montmorency and geraldine seymour who lived in the same village and were devotedly attached to each other
i just cried like a child while i was writing it lady_cordelia_fitzgerald was a regal brunette with a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eye
geraldine was a queenly blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eye i never saw anybody with purple eye said diana_barry dubiously
neither did i i just imagined them i wanted something out of the common geraldine had an alabaster brow too
i ve found out what an alabaster brow is that is one of the advantages of being thirteen you know so much more than you did when you were only twelve
well what became of lady_cordelia_fitzgerald and geraldine asked diana_barry who was beginning to feel rather interested in their fate
they grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen then bertram devere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair geraldine
he saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a carriage and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three miles
because you understand the carriage was all smashed up i found it rather hard to imagine the proposal because i had no experience to go by
i asked ruby_gillis if she knew anything about how man proposed because i thought she likely be an authority on the subject having so many sisters married
she said malcolm told susan that his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said what do you say darling pet if we get hitched this fall
ruby_gillis told me she was hid in the hall pantry when malcolm andres proposed to her sister susan and susan said yes no i dont know let me see and there they were engaged as quick as that
but i didnt think that sort of a proposal was a very romantic one so in the end i had to imagine it out as well as i could
i made it very flowery and poetical and bertram went on his knees although ruby_gillis says it isnt done nowadays
geraldine accepted him in a speech a page long i can tell you i took a lot of trouble with that speech
bertram gave her a diamond ring and a ruby_gillis necklace and told her they would go to europe for a wedding tour for he was immensely wealthy
i rewrote it five time and i look upon it as my masterpiece but then alas shadows began to darken over their path
lady_cordelia_fitzgerald was secretly in love with bertram herself and when geraldine told her about the engagement she was simply furious especially when she saw the necklace and the diamond ring
all her affection for geraldine turned to bitter hate and she vowed that she should never marry bertram but she pretended to be geraldine friend the same as ever
one evening they were standing on the bridge over a rushing turbulent stream and lady_cordelia_fitzgerald thinking they were alone pushed geraldine over the brink with a wild mocking ha ha ha
but bertram saw it all and he at once plunged into the current exclaiming i will save thee my peerless geraldine
but alas he had forgotten he couldnt swim and they were both drowned clasped in each other arms their bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards
they were buried in the one grave and their funeral was most imposing diana_barry it so much more romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding
as for lady_cordelia_fitzgerald she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic asylum i thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime
how perfectly lovely sighed diana_barry who belonged to matthew_cuthbert school of critics i dont see how you can make up such thrilling thing out of your own head anne_shirley
i wish my imagination was as good as yours it would be if you only cultivate it said anne_shirley cheeringly
i ve just thought of a plan diana_barry let you and me have a story club all our own and write story for practice
i ll help you along until you can do them by yourself you ought to cultivate your imagination you know miss_stacy says so
only we must take the right way i told her about the haunted wood but she said we went the wrong way about it in that
it was limited to diana_barry and anne_shirley at first but soon it was extended to include jane_andrews and ruby_gillis and one or two others who felt that their imagination needed cultivating
no boy were allowed in it although ruby_gillis opined that their admission would make it more exciting and each member had to produce one story a week
this was how the story club came into existence it extremely interesting anne_shirley told miss_marilla_cuthbert each girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over
we are going to keep them all sacredly and have them to read to our descendants we each write under a nom de plume
mine is rosamond montmorency all the girl do pretty well ruby_gillis is rather sentimental she puts too much lovemaking into her story and you know too much is worse than too little
jane_andrews never puts any because she says it makes her feel so silly when she had to read it out loud
she says most of the time she doesnt know what to do with the people so she kills them off to get rid of them
jane_andrews story are extremely sensible then diana_barry puts too many murders into hers i mostly always have to tell them what to write about but that isnt hard for i ve millions of ideas
i think this story writing business is the foolishest yet scoffed miss_marilla_cuthbert you ll get a pack of nonsense into your head and waste time that should be put on your lesson
reading story is bad enough but writing them is worse but we re so careful to put a moral into them all miss_marilla_cuthbert explained anne_shirley
i insist upon that all the good people are rewarded and all the bad one are suitably punished i sure that must have a wholesome effect
the moral is the great thing mr_allan says so i read one of my story to him and mrs_allan and they both agreed that the moral was excellent
only they laughed in the wrong place i like it better when people cry jane_andrews and ruby_gillis almost always cry when i come to the pathetic part
diana_barry wrote her aunt miss_josephine_barry about our club and her aunt miss_josephine_barry wrote back that we were to send her some of our story
so we copied out four of our very best and sent them miss miss_josephine_barry diana_barry wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life
that kind of puzzled us because the story were all very pathetic and almost everybody died but i glad miss diana_barry liked them
it shows our club is doing some good in the world mrs_allan says that ought to be our object in everything
i do really try to make it my object but i forget so often when i having fun i hope i shall be a little like mrs_allan when i grow up
do you think there is any prospect of it miss_marilla_cuthbert i shouldnt say there was a great deal was miss_marilla_cuthbert encouraging answer
i sure mrs_allan was never such a silly forgetful little girl as you are no but she wasnt always so good as she is now either said anne_shirley seriously
she told me so herself that is she said she was a dreadful mischief when she was a girl and was always getting into scrapes
is it very wicked of me miss_marilla_cuthbert to feel encouraged when i hear that other people have been bad and mischievous
mrs_rachel_lynde says she always feels shocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty no matter how small they were
mrs_rachel_lynde says she once heard a minister confess that when he was a boy he stole a strawberry tart out of his aunt pantry
i felt so encouraged when i heard that mrs_rachel_lynde says it is and she never had any respect for that minister again
i have thought that it was real noble of him to confess it and i have thought what an encouraging thing it would be for small boy nowadays who do naughty thing and are sorry for them to know that perhaps they may grow up to be minister in spite of it
now i wouldnt have felt that way that how i feel miss_marilla_cuthbert the way i feel at present anne_shirley said miss_marilla_cuthbert is that it high time you had those dishes washed
you ve taken half an hour longer than you should with all your chattering learn to work first and talk afterwards
one late april evening from an aid meeting realized that the winter was over and gone with the thrill of delight that spring never fails to bring to the oldest and saddest as well as to the youngest and merriest
chapter xxvii vanity and vexation of spirit miss_marilla_cuthbert walking home miss_marilla_cuthbert was not given to subjective analysis of her thoughts and feeling
she probably imagined that she was thinking about the aids and their missionary box and the new carpet for the vestry room but under these reflections was a harmonious consciousness of red field smoking into pale purply mists in the declining sun of long sharp pointed fir shadows falling over the meadow beyond the brook of still crimson budded maples around a mirrorlike wood pool of a wakening in the world and a stir of hidden pulses under the gray sod
the spring was abroad in the land and miss_marilla_cuthbert sober middle aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep primal gladness
her eye dwelt affectionately on green gables peering through its network of tree and reflecting the sunlight back from its window in several little coruscations of glory
miss_marilla_cuthbert as she picked her steps along the damp lane thought that it was really a satisfaction to know that she was going home to a briskly snapping wood fire and a table nicely spread for tea instead of to the cold comfort of old aid meeting evening before anne_shirley had come to green gables
consequently when miss_marilla_cuthbert entered her kitchen and found the fire black out with no sign of anne_shirley anywhere she felt justly disappointed and irritated
she had told anne_shirley to be sure and have tea ready at five clock but now she must hurry to take off her second best dress and prepare the meal herself against matthew_cuthbert return from plowing
i ll settle miss anne_shirley when she comes home said miss_marilla_cuthbert grimly as she shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than was strictly necessary
she gadding off somewhere with diana_barry writing story or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery and never thinking once about the time or her duties
matthew_cuthbert had come in and was waiting patiently for his tea in his corner she just got to be pulled up short and sudden on this sort of thing
she may be bright and sweet enough but her head is full of nonsense and there never any knowing what shape it ll break out in next
i dont care if mrs_allan does say she the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew just as soon as she grows out of one freak she takes up with another
but there here i am saying the very thing i was so riled with mrs_rachel_lynde for saying at the aid today
i was real glad when mrs_allan spoke up for anne_shirley for if she hadnt i know i have said something too sharp to mrs_rachel_lynde before everybody
but i bringing her up and not mrs_rachel_lynde who pick faults in the angel gabriel himself if he lived in avonlea
just the same anne_shirley has no business to leave the house like this when i told her she was to stay home this afternoon and look after thing
anne_shirley got plenty of faults goodness knows and far be it from me to deny it i must say with all her faults i never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before
well now i dunno said matthew_cuthbert who being patient and wise and above all hungry had deemed it best to let miss_marilla_cuthbert talk her wrath out unhindered having learned by experience that she got through with whatever work was on hand much quicker if not delayed by untimely argument
and i real sorry to find her so now perhaps you re judging her too hasty miss_marilla_cuthbert dont call her untrustworthy until you re sure she has disobeyed you
mebbe it can all be explained anne_shirley a great hand at explaining she not here when i told her to stay retorted miss_marilla_cuthbert
i reckon she ll find it hard to explain that to my satisfaction of course i knew you take her part matthew_cuthbert
it was dark when supper was ready and still no sign of anne_shirley coming hurriedly over the log bridge or up lover lane breathless and repentant with a sense of neglected duties
then wanting a candle to light her way down the cellar she went up to the east gable for the one that generally stood on anne_shirley table
but i bringing her up not you miss_marilla_cuthbert washed and put away the dishes grimly lighting it she turned around to see anne_shirley herself lying on the bed face downward among the pillows
mercy on us said astonished miss_marilla_cuthbert have you been asleep anne_shirley no was the muffled reply are you sick then demanded miss_marilla_cuthbert anxiously going over to the bed
anne_shirley cowered deeper into her pillows as if desirous of hiding herself forever from mortal eye no but please miss_marilla_cuthbert go away and dont look at me
and i dont care who gets head in class or writes the best composition or sings in the sunday school choir any more
little thing like that are of no importance now because i dont suppose i ll ever be able to go anywhere again
i in the depths of despair my career is closed please miss_marilla_cuthbert go away and dont look at me did anyone ever hear the like
the mystified miss_marilla_cuthbert wanted to know anne_shirley whatever is the matter with you what have you done get right up this minute and tell me
this minute i say there now what is it anne_shirley had slid to the floor in despairing obedience look at my hair miss_marilla_cuthbert she whispered
accordingly miss_marilla_cuthbert lifted her candle and looked scrutinizingly at anne_shirley hair flowing in heavy masses down her back it certainly had a very strange appearance
green it might be called if it were any earthly color a queer dull bronzy green with streaks here and there of the original red to heighten the ghastly effect
anne_shirley what have you done to your hair why it green never in all her life had miss_marilla_cuthbert seen anything so grotesque as anne_shirley hair at that moment
yes it green moaned anne_shirley i thought nothing could be as bad as red hair but now i know it ten time worse to have green hair
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert you little know how utterly wretched i am i little know how you got into this fix but i mean to find out said miss_marilla_cuthbert
come right down to the kitchen it too cold up here and tell me just what you ve done i ve been expecting something queer for some time
you havent got into any scrape for over two months and i was sure another one was due now then what did you do to your hair
i dyed it dyed it dyed your hair anne_shirley didnt you know it was a wicked thing to do yes i knew it was a little wicked admitted anne_shirley
but i thought it was worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair i counted the cost miss_marilla_cuthbert
besides i meant to be extra good in other way to make up for it well said miss_marilla_cuthbert sarcastically if i decided it was worth while to dye my hair
i have dyed it a decent color at least i wouldnt have dyed it green but i didnt mean to dye it green miss_marilla_cuthbert protested anne_shirley dejectedly
if i was wicked i meant to be wicked to some purpose he said it would turn my hair a beautiful raven black he positively assured me that it would
and mrs_allan says we should never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they re not
how could i doubt his word miss_marilla_cuthbert i know what it feels like to have your word doubted i have proof now green hair is proof enough for anybody
but i hadnt then and i believed every word he said implicitly who said who are you talking about
the peddler that was here this afternoon i bought the dye from him anne_shirley how often have i told you never to let one of those italians in the house
i dont believe in encouraging them to come around at all oh i didnt let him in the house
i remembered what you told me and i went out carefully shut the door and looked at his thing on the step
he had a big box full of very interesting thing and he told me he was working hard to make enough money to bring his wife and child out from germany
besides he wasnt an italian he was a german jew he spoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart i wanted to buy something from him to help him in such a worthy object
then all at once i saw the bottle of hair dye the peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a beautiful raven black and wouldnt wash off
in a trice i saw myself with beautiful raven black hair and the temptation was irresistible but the price of the bottle was seventy five cents
i think the peddler had a very kind heart for he said that seeing it was me he sell it for fifty cents and that was just giving it away
and i had only fifty cents left out of my chicken money so i bought it and as soon as he had gone
i came up here and applied it with an old hairbrush as the directions said i used up the whole bottle and oh miss_marilla_cuthbert when i saw the dreadful color it turned my hair
well i hope you ll repent to good purpose said miss_marilla_cuthbert severely and that you ve got your eye opened to where your vanity has led you anne_shirley
i repented of being wicked i can tell you and i ve been repenting ever since goodness knows what to be done
i suppose the first thing is to give your hair a good washing and see if that will do any good
accordingly anne_shirley washed her hair scrubbing it vigorously with soap and water but for all the difference it made she might as well have been scouring its original red
the peddler had certainly spoken the truth when he declared that the dye wouldnt wash off however his veracity might be impeached in other respects
people have pretty well forgotten my other mistake the liniment cake and setting diana_barry drunk and flying into a temper with mrs_rachel_lynde
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert what shall i do questioned anne_shirley in tear i can never live this down but they ll never forget this
they will think i am not respectable oh miss_marilla_cuthbert what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive
that is poetry but it is true and oh how josie_pye will laugh miss_marilla_cuthbert i cannot face josie_pye i am the unhappiest girl in prince edward island
diana_barry alone of outsiders knew the fatal secret but she promised solemnly never to tell and it may be stated here and now that she kept her word
anne_shirley unhappiness continued for a week during that time she went nowhere and shampooed her hair every day at the end of the week miss_marilla_cuthbert said decidedly it no use anne_shirley
that is fast dye if ever there was any your hair must be cut off there is no other way you cant go out with it looking like that
anne_shirley lips quivered but she realized the bitter truth of miss_marilla_cuthbert remarks with a dismal sigh she went for the scissors
please cut it off at once miss_marilla_cuthbert and have it over oh i feel that my heart is broken this is such an unromantic affliction
the girl in book lose their hair in fevers or sell it to get money for some good deed and i sure i wouldnt mind losing my hair in some such fashion half so much
but there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you ve dyed it a dreadful color is there i going to weep all the time you re cutting it off if it wont interfere
it seems such a tragic thing anne_shirley wept then but later on when she went upstairs and looked in the glass she was calm with despair
miss_marilla_cuthbert had done her work thoroughly and it had been necessary to shingle the hair as closely as possible the result was not becoming to state the case as mildly as may be
anne_shirley promptly turned her glass to the wall i ll never never look at myself again until my hair grows she exclaimed passionately
then she suddenly righted the glass yes i will too i do penance for being wicked that way i ll look at myself every time i come to my room and see how ugly i am
i never thought i was vain about my hair of all thing but now i know i was in spite of its being red because it was so long and thick and curly
anne_shirley clipped head made a sensation in school on the following monday but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it not even josie_pye who however did not fail to inform anne_shirley that she looked like a perfect scarecrow
i didnt say anything when josie_pye said that to me anne_shirley confided that evening to miss_marilla_cuthbert who was lying on the sofa after one of her headaches because i thought it was part of my punishment
and i wont try to imagine it away either i expect something will happen to my nose next and i ought to bear it patiently
it hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and i wanted to say something back but i didnt i just swept her one scornful look
and then i forgave her it makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people doesnt it i mean to devote all my energies to being good after this
and i shall never try to be beautiful again of course it better to be good i know it is but it sometimes so hard to believe a thing even when you know it
i do really want to be good miss_marilla_cuthbert like you and mrs_allan and miss_stacy and grow up to be a credit to you
diana_barry says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side
she says she thinks it will be very becoming i will call it a snood that sounds so romantic but am i talking too much miss_marilla_cuthbert
does it hurt your head my head is better now it was terrible bad this afternoon though these headaches of mine are getting worse and worse
i ll have to see a doctor about them as for your chatter i dont know that i mind it i ve got so used to it
which was miss_marilla_cuthbert way of saying that she liked to hear it chapter xxviii an unfortunate lily maid of course you must be elaine anne_shirley said diana_barry
i could never have the courage to float down there nor i said ruby_gillis with a shiver
i dont mind floating down when there two or three of us in the flat and we can sit up it fun then
but to lie down and pretend i was dead i just couldnt i die really of fright of course it would be romantic conceded jane_andrews but i know i couldnt keep still
i be popping up every minute or so to see where i was and if i wasnt drifting too far out
and you know anne_shirley that would spoil the effect but it so ridiculous to have a redheaded elaine mourned anne_shirley
ruby_gillis ought to be elaine because she is so fair and has such lovely long golden hair elaine had all her bright hair streaming down you know
i not afraid to float down and i love to be elaine but it ridiculous just the same and elaine was the lily maid
your complexion is just as fair as ruby_gillis said diana_barry earnestly and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it
now a red haired person cannot be a lily maid oh do you really think so exclaimed anne_shirley flushing sensitively with delight
i ve sometimes thought it was myself but i never dared to ask anyone for fear she would tell me it wasnt
yes and i think it is real pretty said diana_barry looking admiringly at the short silky curls that clustered over anne_shirley head and were held in place by a very jaunty black velvet ribbon and bow
they were standing on the bank of the pond below orchard slope where a little headland fringed with birches ran out from the bank at its tip was a small wooden platform built out into the water for the convenience of fishermen and duck hunters
do you think it could be called auburn now diana_barry ruby_gillis and jane_andrews were spending the midsummer afternoon with diana_barry and anne_shirley had come over to play with them
idlewild was a thing of the past mr_william_bell having ruthlessly cut down the little circle of tree in his back pasture in the spring
anne_shirley had sat among the stumps and wept not without an eye to the romance of it but she was speedily consoled for after all as she and diana_barry said big girl of thirteen going on fourteen were too old for such childish amusements as playhouses and there were more fascinating sports to be found about the pond
it was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge and the two girl learned to row themselves about in the little flat bottomed dory mr diana_barry kept for duck shooting
anne_shirley and diana_barry had spent most of their playtime that summer on and about the pond it was anne_shirley idea that they dramatize elaine
they had studied tennyson poem in school the preceding winter the superintendent of education having prescribed it in the english course for the prince edward island school
they had analyzed and parsed it and torn it to pieces in general until it was a wonder there was any meaning at all left in it for them but at least the fair lily maid and lancelot and guinevere and king arthur had become very real people to them and anne_shirley was devoured by secret regret that she had not been born in camelot
the girl had discovered that if the flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down with the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another headland lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond
those day she said were so much more romantic than the present anne_shirley plan was hailed with enthusiasm they had often gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing elaine
well i ll be elaine said anne_shirley yielding reluctantly for although she would have been delighted to play the principal character yet her artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this she felt her limitations made impossible
ruby_gillis you must be king arthur and jane_andrews will be guinevere and diana_barry must be lancelot but first you must be the brothers and the father
we cant have the old dumb servitor because there isnt room for two in the flat when one is lying down
we must pall the barge all its length in blackest samite that old black shawl of your mother will be just the thing diana_barry
the black shawl having been procured anne_shirley spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom with closed eye and hand folded over her breast
oh she does look really dead whispered ruby_gillis nervously watching the still white little face under the flickering shadows of the birches
it makes me feel frightened girl do you suppose it really right to act like this mrs_rachel_lynde says that all play acting is abominably wicked
ruby_gillis you shouldnt talk about mrs_rachel_lynde said anne_shirley severely it spoils the effect because this is hundreds of year before mrs_rachel_lynde was born
cloth of gold for coverlet there was none but an old piano scarf of yellow japanese crepe was an excellent substitute
a white lily was not obtainable just then but the effect of a tall blue iris placed in one of anne_shirley folded hand was all that could be desired
jane_andrews you arrange this it silly for elaine to be talking when she dead jane_andrews rose to the occasion
we must kiss her quiet brows and diana_barry you say sister farewell forever and ruby_gillis you say farewell sweet sister both of you as sorrowfully as you possibly can
now she all ready said jane_andrews anne_shirley for goodness sake smile a little you know elaine lay as though she smiled
that better now push the flat off the flat was accordingly pushed off scraping roughly over an old embedded stake in the process
diana_barry and jane_andrews and ruby_gillis only waited long enough to see it caught in the current and headed for the bridge before scampering up through the wood across the road and down to the lower headland where as lancelot and guinevere and the king they were to be in readiness to receive the lily maid
for a few minute anne_shirley drifting slowly down enjoyed the romance of her situation to the full then something happened not at all romantic
in a very few moment it was necessary for elaine to scramble to her feet pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall of blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her barge through which the water was literally pouring
the flat began to leak that sharp stake at the landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat
anne_shirley did not know this but it did not take her long to realize that she was in a dangerous plight
at this rate the flat would fill and sink long before it could drift to the lower headland where were the oars
anne_shirley gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard she was white to the lips but she did not lose her self possession
i was horribly frightened she told mrs_allan the next day and it seemed like year while the flat was drifting down to the bridge and the water rising in it every moment
i prayed mrs_allan most earnestly but i didnt shut my eye to pray for i knew the only way god could save me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge piles for me to climb up on it
you know the piles are just old tree trunks and there are lot of knots and old branch stubs on them
left behind at the landing there was one chance just one it was proper to pray but i had to do my part by watching out and
right well i knew it i just said dear god please take the flat close to a pile and i ll do the rest over and over again
under such circumstances you dont think much about making a flowery prayer but mine was answered for the flat bumped right into a pile for a minute
and i flung the scarf and the shawl over my shoulder and scrambled up on a big providential stub and there i was mrs_allan clinging to that slippery old pile with no way of getting up or down
it was a very unromantic position but i didnt think about that at the time you dont think much about romance when you have just escaped from a watery grave
i said a grateful prayer at once and then i gave all my attention to holding on tight for i knew i should probably have to depend on human aid to get back to dry land
ruby_gillis jane_andrews and diana_barry already awaiting it on the lower headland saw it disappear before their very eye and had not a doubt but that anne_shirley had gone down with it
for a moment they stood still white as sheets frozen with horror at the tragedy then shrieking at the tops of their voice they started on a frantic run up through the wood never pausing as they crossed the main road to glance the way of the bridge
the flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream anne_shirley clinging desperately to her precarious foothold saw their flying forms and heard their shrieks
help would soon come but meanwhile her position was a very uncomfortable one the minute passed by each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid
why didnt somebody come where had the girl gone suppose they had fainted one and all suppose nobody ever came suppose she grew so tired and cramped that she could hold on no longer
anne_shirley looked at the wicked green depths below her wavering with long oily shadows and shivered her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her
then just as she thought she really could not endure the ache in her arms and wrists another moment gilbert_blythe came rowing under the bridge in harmon andrews dory
gilbert_blythe glanced up and much to his amazement beheld a little white scornful face looking down upon him with big frightened but also scornful gray eye
anne_shirley how on earth did you get there he exclaimed without waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended his hand
there was no help for it anne_shirley clinging to gilbert_blythe hand scrambled down into the dory where she sat drabbled and furious in the stern with her arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe
it was certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances what has happened anne_shirley asked gilbert_blythe taking up his oars
we were playing elaine explained anne_shirley frigidly without even looking at her rescuer and i had to drift down to camelot in the barge i mean the flat
the flat began to leak and i climbed out on the pile the girl went for help will you be kind enough to row me to the landing
gilbert_blythe obligingly rowed to the landing and anne_shirley disdaining assistance sprang nimbly on shore i very much obliged to you she said haughtily as she turned away
but gilbert_blythe had also sprung from the boat and now laid a detaining hand on her arm anne_shirley he said hurriedly look here
cant we be good friend i awfully sorry i made fun of your hair that time i didnt mean to vex you
and i only meant it for a joke besides it so long ago i think your hair is awfully pretty now honest i do
she had an odd newly awakened consciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half shy half eager expression in gilbert_blythe hazel eye was something that was very good to see
let be friend for a moment anne_shirley hesitated her heart gave a quick queer little beat but the bitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering determination
that scene of two year before flashed back into her recollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday gilbert_blythe had called her carrots and had brought about her disgrace before the whole school
her resentment which to other and older people might be as laughable as its cause was in no whit allayed and softened by time seemingly
she hated gilbert_blythe she would never forgive him no she said coldly i shall never be friend with you gilbert_blythe and i dont want to be
all right gilbert_blythe sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his cheeks i ll never ask you to be friend again anne_shirley
and i dont care either he pulled away with swift defiant strokes and anne_shirley went up the steep ferny little path under the maples
she held her head very high but she was conscious of an odd feeling of regret she almost wished she had answered gilbert_blythe differently
of course he had insulted her terribly but still altogether anne_shirley rather thought it would be a relief to sit down and have a good cry
she was really quite unstrung for the reaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt halfway up the path she met jane_andrews and diana_barry
rushing back to the pond in a state narrowly removed from positive frenzy they had found nobody at orchard slope both mr and mrs diana_barry being away
here ruby_gillis had succumbed to hysterics and was left to recover from them as best she might while jane_andrews and diana_barry flew through the haunted wood and across the brook to green gables
there they had found nobody either for miss_marilla_cuthbert had gone to carmody and matthew_cuthbert was making hay in the back field
oh anne_shirley gasped diana_barry fairly falling on the former neck and weeping with relief and delight oh anne_shirley we thought you were drowned and we felt like murderers because we had made you be elaine
i climbed up on one of the piles explained anne_shirley wearily and gilbert_blythe came along in mr andrews dory and brought me to land
and ruby_gillis is in hysterics oh anne_shirley how did you escape oh anne_shirley how splendid of him why it so romantic said jane_andrews finding breath enough for utterance at last
of course you ll speak to him after this of course i wont flashed anne_shirley with a momentary return of her old spirit
and i dont want ever to hear the word romantic again jane_andrews i awfully sorry you were so frightened girl
it is all my fault i feel sure i was born under an unlucky star everything i do gets me or my dearest friend into a scrape
we ve gone and lost your father flat diana_barry and i have a presentiment that we ll not be allowed to row on the pond any more
anne_shirley presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt to do great was the consternation in the diana_barry and miss_marilla_cuthbert households when the events of the afternoon became known
will you ever have any sense anne_shirley groaned miss_marilla_cuthbert oh yes i think i will miss_marilla_cuthbert returned anne_shirley optimistically
a good cry indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable had soothed her nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness
i think my prospects of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever i dont see how said miss_marilla_cuthbert
ever since i came to green gables i ve been making mistake and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming
well explained anne_shirley i ve learned a new and valuable lesson today the affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with thing that didnt belong to me
the haunted wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with me the liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in cooking
dyeing my hair cured me of vanity i never think about my hair and nose now at least very seldom and today mistake is going to cure me of being too romantic
i have come to the conclusion that it is no use trying to be romantic in avonlea it was probably easy enough in towered camelot hundreds of year ago but romance is not appreciated now
i feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect miss_marilla_cuthbert i sure i hope so said miss_marilla_cuthbert skeptically
but matthew_cuthbert who had been sitting mutely in his corner laid a hand on anne_shirley shoulder when miss_marilla_cuthbert had gone out
dont give up all your romance anne_shirley he whispered shyly a little of it is a good thing not too much of course but keep a little of it anne_shirley keep a little of it
chapter xxix an epoch in anne_shirley life anne_shirley was bringing the cows home from the back pasture by way of lover lane
it was a september evening and all the gaps and clearings in the wood were brimmed up with ruby_gillis sunset light
here and there the lane was splashed with it but for the most part it was already quite shadowy beneath the maples and the spaces under the firs were filled with a clear violet dusk like airy wine
the winds were out in their tops and there is no sweeter music on earth than that which the wind makes in the fir tree at evening
the cows swung placidly down the lane and anne_shirley followed them dreamily repeating aloud the battle canto from marmion which had also been part of their english course the preceding winter and which miss_stacy had made them learn off by heart and exulting in its rushing lines and the clash of spears in its imagery
when she came to the lines the stubborn spearsmen still made good their dark impenetrable wood she stopped in ecstasy to shut her eye that she might the better fancy herself
when she opened them again it was to behold diana_barry coming through the gate that led into the diana_barry field and looking so important that anne_shirley instantly divined there was news to be told
one of that heroic ring but betray too eager curiosity she would not isnt this evening just like a purple dream diana_barry
it makes me so glad to be alive in the morning i always think the morning are best but when evening comes i think it lovelier still
it a very fine evening said diana_barry but oh i have such news anne_shirley guess you can have three guesses
charlotte ruby_gillis is going to be married in the church after all and mrs_allan wants us to decorate it cried anne_shirley
charlotte beau wont agree to that because nobody ever has been married in the church yet and he thinks it would seem too much like a funeral
no it too mean because it would be such fun guess again jane_andrews mother is going to let her have a birthday party
i cant think what it can be said anne_shirley in despair unless it that moody_spurgeon_macpherson saw you home from prayer meeting last night
diana_barry shook her head her black eye dancing with merriment did he i should think not exclaimed diana_barry indignantly
i wouldnt be likely to boast of it if he did the horrid creature i knew you couldnt guess it
mother had a letter from aunt miss_josephine_barry today and aunt miss_josephine_barry wants you and me to go to town next tuesday and stop with her for the exhibition
oh diana_barry whispered anne_shirley finding it necessary to lean up against a maple tree for support do you really mean it
that was what she said last week when jane_andrews invited me to go with them in their double seated buggy to the american concert at the white sands hotel
there but i afraid miss_marilla_cuthbert wont let me go she will say that she cant encourage gadding about i wanted to go but miss_marilla_cuthbert said i be better at home learning my lesson
and so would jane_andrews i was bitterly disappointed diana_barry i felt so heartbroken that i wouldnt say my prayer when i went to bed
but i repented of that and got up in the middle of the night and said them i ll tell you said diana_barry we ll get mother to ask miss_marilla_cuthbert
she ll be more likely to let you go then and if she does we ll have the time of our life anne_shirley
i ve never been to an exhibition and it so aggravating to hear the other girl talking about their trips jane_andrews and ruby_gillis have been twice and they re going this year again
i not going to think about it at all until i know whether i can go or not said anne_shirley resolutely
if i did and then was disappointed it would be more than i could bear but in case i do go
she said my old one would do very well for another winter and that i ought to be satisfied with having a new dress
i very glad my new coat will be ready by that time miss_marilla_cuthbert didnt think i needed a new coat the dress is very pretty diana_barry navy blue and made so fashionably
miss_marilla_cuthbert always makes my dress fashionably now because she says she doesnt intend to have matthew_cuthbert going to mrs_rachel_lynde to make them
i so glad it is ever so much easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable at least it is easier for me
but matthew_cuthbert said i must have a new coat so miss_marilla_cuthbert bought a lovely piece of blue broadcloth and it being made by a real dressmaker over at carmody
it to be done saturday night and i trying not to imagine myself walking up the church aisle on sunday in my new suit and cap because i afraid it isnt right to imagine such thing
i suppose it doesnt make such a difference to naturally good people but it just slips into my mind in spite of me
my cap is so pretty matthew_cuthbert bought it for me the day we were over at carmody it is one of those little blue velvet one that are all the rage with gold cord and tassels
when i saw you come into church last sunday my heart swelled with pride to think you were my dearest friend
your new hat is elegant diana_barry and so becoming do you suppose it wrong for us to think so much about our clothes
miss_marilla_cuthbert agreed to let anne_shirley go to town and it was arranged that mr diana_barry should take the girl in on the following tuesday
as charlottetown was thirty miles away and mr diana_barry wished to go and return the same day it was necessary to make a very early start
miss_marilla_cuthbert says it is very sinful but it is such an interesting subject isnt it but anne_shirley counted it all joy and was up before sunrise on tuesday morning
a glance from her window assured her that the day would be fine for the eastern sky behind the firs of the haunted wood was all silvery and cloudless
through the gap in the tree a light was shining in the western gable of orchard slope a token that diana_barry was also up
anne_shirley was dressed by the time matthew_cuthbert had the fire on and had the breakfast ready when miss_marilla_cuthbert came down but for her own part was much too excited to eat
after breakfast the jaunty new cap and jacket were donned and anne_shirley hastened over the brook and up through the firs to orchard slope
mr diana_barry and diana_barry were waiting for her and they were soon on the road it was a long drive but anne_shirley and diana_barry enjoyed every minute of it
it was delightful to rattle along over the moist road in the early red sunlight that was creeping across the shorn harvest field
sometimes the road went through wood where maples were beginning to hang out scarlet banners sometimes it crossed rivers on bridge that made anne_shirley flesh cringe with the old half delightful fear sometimes it wound along a harbor shore and passed by a little cluster of weather gray fishing huts again it mounted to hill
whence a far sweep of curving upland or misty blue sky could be seen but wherever it went there was much of interest to discuss
the air was fresh and crisp and little smoke blue mists curled through the valleys and floated off from the hill it was almost noon when they reached town and found their way to beechwood
it was quite a fine old mansion set back from the street in a seclusion of green elms and branching beeches
miss diana_barry met them at the door with a twinkle in her sharp black eye so you ve come to see me at last
you anne_shirley girl she said mercy child how you have grown you re taller than i am i declare and you re ever so much better looking than you used to be too
i know i not so freckled as i used to be so i ve much to be thankful for but i really hadnt dared to hope there was any other improvement
but i dare say you know that without being told indeed i didnt said anne_shirley radiantly i so glad you think there is miss diana_barry
the two little country girl were rather abashed by the splendor of the parlor where miss diana_barry left them when she went to see about dinner
miss diana_barry house was furnished with great magnificence as anne_shirley told miss_marilla_cuthbert afterward isnt it just like a palace
whispered diana_barry i never was in aunt miss_josephine_barry house before and i no idea it was so grand i just wish julia mr_william_bell could see this she puts on such air about her mother parlor
velvet carpet sighed anne_shirley luxuriously and silk curtains i ve dreamed of such thing diana_barry but do you know i dont believe i feel very comfortable with them after all
there are so many thing in this room and all so splendid that there is no scope for imagination that is one consolation when you are poor there are so many more thing you can imagine about
their sojourn in town was something that anne_shirley and diana_barry dated from for year from first to last it was crowded with delights
on wednesday miss diana_barry took them to the exhibition grounds and kept them there all day it was splendid anne_shirley related to miss_marilla_cuthbert later on
i never imagined anything so interesting i dont really know which department was the most interesting i think i liked the horses and the flower and the fancywork best
and i was glad that i felt glad for it shows i improving dont you think miss_marilla_cuthbert when i can rejoice in josie_pye success
josie_pye took first prize for knitted lace i was real glad she did mr harmon andrews took second prize for gravenstein apple and mr_william_bell took first prize for a pig
diana_barry said she thought it was ridiculous for a sunday school superintendent to take a prize in pigs but i dont see why
do you she said she would always think of it after this when he was praying so solemnly clara louise macpherson took a prize for painting and mrs_rachel_lynde got first prize for homemade butter and cheese
mrs_rachel_lynde was there that day and i never knew how much i really liked her until i saw her familiar face among all those strangers
so avonlea was pretty well represented wasnt it there were thousands of people there miss_marilla_cuthbert it made me feel dreadfully insignificant
mrs_rachel_lynde wouldnt go she said horse racing was an abomination and she being a church member thought it her bounden duty to set a good example by staying away
and miss diana_barry took us up to the grandstand to see the horse races but there were so many there i dont believe mrs_rachel_lynde absence would ever be noticed
i dont think though that i ought to go very often to horse races because they are awfully fascinating diana_barry got so excited that she offered to bet me ten cents that the red horse would win
i didnt believe he would but i refused to bet because i wanted to tell mrs_allan all about everything and i felt sure it wouldnt do to tell her that
it always wrong to do anything you cant tell the minister wife it as good as an extra conscience to have a minister wife for your friend
and i was very glad i didnt bet because the red horse did win and i would have lost ten cents
i love to go up in a balloon miss_marilla_cuthbert it would be simply thrilling and we saw a man selling fortunes
so you see that virtue was its own reward we saw a man go up in a balloon you paid him ten cents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you
mine was that i would marry a dark complected man who was very wealthy and i would go across water to live
i looked carefully at all the dark man i saw after that but i didnt care much for any of them and anyhow i suppose it too early to be looking out for him yet
miss diana_barry gave diana_barry and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told oh it was a never to be forgotten day miss_marilla_cuthbert
it was an elegant room miss_marilla_cuthbert but somehow sleeping in a spare room isnt what i used to think it was
i was so tired i couldnt sleep at night miss diana_barry put us in the spare room according to promise that the worst of growing up and i beginning to realize it
the thing you wanted so much when you were a child dont seem half so wonderful to you when you get them
thursday the girl had a drive in the park and in the evening miss diana_barry took them to a concert in the academy of music where a noted prima donna was to sing
to anne_shirley the evening was a glittering vision of delight oh miss_marilla_cuthbert it was beyond description i was so excited i couldnt even talk so you may know what it was like
i just sat in enraptured silence madame selitsky was perfectly beautiful and wore white satin and diamonds but when she began to sing i never thought about anything else
oh i cant tell you how i felt but it seemed to me that it could never be hard to be good any more
i felt like i do when i look up to the stars tear came into my eye but oh they were such happy tear
i was so sorry when it was all over and i told miss diana_barry i didnt see how i was ever to return to common life again
she said she thought if we went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream it might help me
the ice cream was delicious miss_marilla_cuthbert and it was so lovely and dissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven clock at night
that sounded so prosaic but to my surprise i found it true diana_barry said she believed she was born for city life
miss diana_barry asked me what my opinion was but i said i would have to think it over very seriously before i could tell her what i really thought
and i came to the conclusion miss_marilla_cuthbert that i wasnt born for city life and that i was glad of it
it nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant restaurants at eleven clock at night once in a while but as a regular thing i rather be in the east gable at eleven sound asleep but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook
so i thought it over after i went to bed that is the best time to think thing out i told miss diana_barry so at breakfast the next morning and she laughed
miss diana_barry generally laughed at anything i said even when i said the most solemn thing i dont think i liked it miss_marilla_cuthbert because i wasnt trying to be funny
but she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally friday brought going home time and mr diana_barry drove in for the girl
well i hope you ve enjoyed yourselves said miss diana_barry as she bade them good bye indeed we have said diana_barry
i ve enjoyed every minute of the time said anne_shirley throwing her arms impulsively about the old woman neck and kissing her wrinkled cheek
and you anne_shirley girl diana_barry would never have dared to do such a thing and felt rather aghast at anne_shirley freedom
but miss diana_barry was pleased and she stood on her veranda and watched the buggy out of sight then she went back into her big house with a sigh
miss diana_barry was a rather selfish old lady if the truth must be told and had never cared much for anybody but herself
it seemed very lonely lacking those fresh young life she valued people only as they were of service to her or amused her
but miss diana_barry found herself thinking less about anne_shirley quaint speeches than of her fresh enthusiasms her transparent emotions her little winning way and the sweetness of her eye and lips
i thought miss_marilla_cuthbert was an old fool when i heard she adopted a girl out of an orphan asylum she said to herself but i guess she didnt make much of a mistake after all
anne_shirley had amused her and consequently stood high in the old lady good graces if i a child like anne_shirley in the house all the time i be a better and happier woman
anne_shirley and diana_barry found the drive home as pleasant as the drive in pleasanter indeed since there was the delightful consciousness of home waiting at the end of it
it was sunset when they passed through white sands and turned into the shore road beyond the avonlea hill came out darkly against the saffron sky
behind them the moon was rising out of the sea that grew all radiant and transfigured in her light every little cove along the curving road was a marvel of dancing ripples
the waves broke with a soft swish on the rocks below them and the tang of the sea was in the strong fresh air
when she crossed the log bridge over the brook the kitchen light of green gables winked her a friendly welcome back and through the open door shone the hearth fire sending out its warm red glow athwart the chilly autumn night
oh but it good to be alive and to be going home breathed anne_shirley anne_shirley ran blithely up the hill and into the kitchen where a hot supper was waiting on the table
so you ve got back said miss_marilla_cuthbert folding up her knitting yes and oh it so good to be back said anne_shirley joyously
i could kiss everything even to the clock miss_marilla_cuthbert a broiled chicken you dont mean to say you cooked that for me
yes i did said miss_marilla_cuthbert i thought you be hungry after such a drive and need something real appetizing hurry and take off your thing and we ll have supper as soon as matthew_cuthbert comes in
i glad you ve got back i must say it been fearful lonesome here without you and i never put in four longer day
after supper anne_shirley sat before the fire between matthew_cuthbert and miss_marilla_cuthbert and gave them a full account of her visit
i ve had a splendid time she concluded happily and i feel that it marks an epoch in my life but the best of it all was the coming home
chapter xxx the queens class is organized miss_marilla_cuthbert laid her knitting on her lap and leaned back in her chair
her eye were tired and she thought vaguely that she must see about having her glasses changed the next time she went to town for her eye had grown tired very often of late
it was nearly dark for the full november twilight had fallen around green gables and the only light in the kitchen came from the dancing red flames in the stove
anne_shirley was curled up turk fashion on the hearthrug gazing into that joyous glow where the sunshine of a hundred summer was being distilled from the maple cordwood
she had been reading but her book had slipped to the floor and now she was dreaming with a smile on her parted lips
glittering castles in spain were shaping themselves out of the mists and rainbows of her lively fancy adventures wonderful and enthralling were happening to her in cloudland
miss_marilla_cuthbert looked at her with a tenderness that would never have been suffered to reveal itself in any clearer light than that soft mingling of fireshine and shadow
the lesson of a love that should display itself easily in spoken word and open look was one miss_marilla_cuthbert could never learn
but she had learned to love this slim gray eyed girl with an affection all the deeper and stronger from its very undemonstrativeness
adventures that always turned out triumphantly and never involved her in scrapes like those of actual life her love made her afraid of being unduly indulgent indeed
she had an uneasy feeling that it was rather sinful to set one heart so intensely on any human creature as she had set hers on anne_shirley and perhaps she performed a sort of unconscious penance for this by being stricter and more critical than if the girl had been less dear to her
certainly anne_shirley herself had no idea how miss_marilla_cuthbert loved her she sometimes thought wistfully that miss_marilla_cuthbert was very hard to please and distinctly lacking in sympathy and understanding
but she always checked the thought reproachfully remembering what she owed to miss_marilla_cuthbert anne_shirley said miss_marilla_cuthbert abruptly miss_stacy was here this afternoon when you were out with diana_barry
anne_shirley came back from her other world with a start and a sigh was she oh i so sorry i wasnt in
why didnt you call me miss_marilla_cuthbert diana_barry and i were only over in the haunted wood it lovely in the wood now
all the little wood thing the ferns and the satin leaves and the crackerberries have gone to sleep just as if somebody had tucked them away until spring under a blanket of leaves
i think it was a little gray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last moonlight night and did it
diana_barry wouldnt say much about that though diana_barry has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about imagining ghosts into the haunted wood
it had a very bad effect on diana_barry imagination it blighted it mrs_rachel_lynde says myrtle mr_william_bell is a blighted being
i asked ruby_gillis why myrtle was blighted and ruby_gillis said she guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her
ruby_gillis thinks of nothing but young man and the older she gets the worse she is young man are all very well in their place but it doesnt do to drag them into everything does it
diana_barry and i are thinking seriously of promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids and live together forever
diana_barry hasnt quite made up her mind though because she thinks perhaps it would be nobler to marry some wild dashing wicked young man and reform him
we feel that we are so much older than we used to be that it isnt becoming to talk of childish matter
diana_barry and i talk a great deal about serious subjects now you know it such a solemn thing to be almost fourteen miss_marilla_cuthbert
miss_stacy took all us girl who are in our teens down to the brook last wednesday and talked to us about it
she said we couldnt be too careful what habits we formed and what ideals we acquired in our teens because by the time we were twenty
our characters would be developed and the foundation laid for our whole future life and she said if the foundation was shaky we could never build anything really worth while on it
and we decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and form respectable habits and learn all we could and be as sensible as possible so that by the time we were twenty
diana_barry and i talked the matter over coming home from school we felt extremely solemn miss_marilla_cuthbert our characters would be properly developed
it perfectly appalling to think of being twenty miss_marilla_cuthbert it sounds so fearfully old and grown up but why was miss_stacy here this afternoon
that is what i want to tell you anne_shirley if you ll ever give me a chance to get a word in edgewise
she was talking about you about me anne_shirley looked rather scared then she flushed and exclaimed oh i know what she was saying
i meant to tell you miss_marilla_cuthbert honestly i did but i forgot miss_stacy caught me reading ben hur in school yesterday afternoon when i should have been studying my canadian history
jane_andrews lent it to me i was reading it at dinner hour and i had just got to the chariot race when school went in
i was simply wild to know how it turned out although i felt sure ben hur must win because it wouldnt be poetical justice if he didnt
so i spread the history open on my desk lid and then tucked ben hur between the desk and my knee
i just looked as if i were studying canadian history you know while all the while i was reveling in ben hur
i was so interested in it that i never noticed miss_stacy coming down the aisle until all at once i just looked up
and there she was looking down at me so reproachful like i cant tell you how ashamed i felt miss_marilla_cuthbert especially when i heard josie_pye giggling
miss_stacy took ben hur away but she never said a word then she kept me in at recess and talked to me
first i was wasting the time i ought to have put on my studies and secondly i was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear i was reading a history when it was a storybook instead
she said i had done very wrong in two respects i had never realized until that moment miss_marilla_cuthbert that what i was doing was deceitful
and i never do such a thing again and i offered to do penance by never so much as looking at ben hur for a whole week not even to see how the chariot race turned out
i was shocked i cried bitterly and asked miss_stacy to forgive me but miss_stacy said she wouldnt require that and she forgave me freely
miss_stacy never mentioned such a thing to me anne_shirley and its only your guilty conscience that the matter with you
so i think it wasnt very kind of her to come up here to you about it after all you have no business to be taking storybooks to school
you read too many novels anyhow when i was a girl i wasnt so much as allowed to look at a novel
oh how can you call ben hur a novel when it really such a religious book protested anne_shirley
of course it a little too exciting to be proper reading for sunday and i only read it on weekdays
and i never read any book now unless either miss_stacy or mrs_allan thinks it is a proper book for a girl thirteen and three quarters to read
miss_stacy made me promise that she found me reading a book one day called the lurid mystery of the haunted hall
it was one ruby_gillis had lent me and oh miss_marilla_cuthbert it was so fascinating and creepy it just curdled the blood in my veins
but miss_stacy said it was a very silly unwholesome book and she asked me not to read any more of it or any like it
i didnt mind promising not to read any more like it but it was agonizing to give back that book without knowing how it turned out
but my love for miss_stacy stood the test and i did it really wonderful miss_marilla_cuthbert what you can do when you re truly anxious to please a certain person
well i guess i ll light the lamp and get to work said miss_marilla_cuthbert i see plainly that you dont want to hear what miss_stacy had to say
you re more interested in the sound of your own tongue than in anything else oh indeed miss_marilla_cuthbert i do want to hear it cried anne_shirley contritely
i know i talk too much but i am really trying to overcome it and although i say far too much yet if you only knew how many thing i want to say and dont you give me some credit for it
well miss_stacy wants to organize a class among her advanced students who mean to study for the entrance examination into queen
i wont say another word not one please tell me miss_marilla_cuthbert she intends to give them extra lesson for an hour after school
and she came to ask matthew_cuthbert and me if we would like to have you join it what do you think about it yourself anne_shirley
would you like to go to queen and pass for a teacher oh miss_marilla_cuthbert anne_shirley straightened to her knees and clasped her hand
it been the dream of my life that is for the last six months ever since ruby_gillis and jane_andrews began to talk of studying for the entrance
but i didnt say anything about it because i supposed it would be perfectly useless i love to be a teacher
mr andrews says it cost him one hundred and fifty dollars to put prissy_andrews through and prissy_andrews wasnt a dunce in geometry
but wont it be dreadfully expensive i guess you neednt worry about that part of it when matthew_cuthbert and i took you to bring up
we resolved we would do the best we could for you and give you a good education i believe in a girl being fitted to earn her own living whether she ever has to or not
you ll always have a home at green gables as long as matthew_cuthbert and i are here but nobody knows what is going to happen in this uncertain world and it just as well to be prepared
so you can join the queen class if you like anne_shirley oh miss_marilla_cuthbert thank you anne_shirley flung her arms about miss_marilla_cuthbert waist and looked up earnestly into her face
i extremely grateful to you and matthew_cuthbert and i ll study as hard as i can and do my very best to be a credit to you
i warn you not to expect much in geometry but i think i can hold my own in anything else if i work hard
not for world would miss_marilla_cuthbert have told anne_shirley just what miss_stacy had said about her that would have been to pamper vanity
i dare say you ll get along well enough miss_stacy says you are bright and diligent you neednt rush to any extreme of killing yourself over your book
there is no hurry you wont be ready to try the entrance for a year and a half yet but it well to begin in time and be thoroughly grounded miss_stacy says
i shall take more interest than ever in my studies now said anne_shirley blissfully because i have a purpose in life
mr_allan says everybody should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully only he says we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose
i would call it a worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like miss_stacy wouldnt you miss_marilla_cuthbert i think it a very noble profession
the queen class was organized in due time gilbert_blythe anne_shirley ruby_gillis jane_andrews josie_pye charlie_sloane and moody_spurgeon_macpherson joined it
diana_barry did not as her parents did not intend to send her to queen this seemed nothing short of a calamity to anne_shirley
on the evening when the queen class first remained in school for the extra lesson and anne_shirley saw diana_barry go slowly out with the others to walk home alone through the birch path and violet vale it was all the former could do to keep her seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum
a lump came into her throat and she hastily retired behind the pages of her uplifted latin grammar to hide the tear in her eye
never since the night on which minnie_may had had the croup had she and diana_barry been separated in anything not for world would anne_shirley have had gilbert_blythe or josie_pye see those tear
but oh miss_marilla_cuthbert i really felt that i had tasted the bitterness of death as mr_allan said in his sermon last sunday when i saw diana_barry go out alone she said mournfully that night
i thought how splendid it would have been if diana_barry had only been going to study for the entrance too
but we cant have thing perfect in this imperfect world as mrs_rachel_lynde says mrs_rachel_lynde isnt exactly a comforting person sometimes but there no doubt
she says a great many very true thing and i think the queen class is going to be extremely interesting jane_andrews and ruby_gillis are just going to study to be teacher
that is the height of their ambition ruby_gillis says she will only teach for two year after she gets through and then she intends to be married
jane_andrews says she will devote her whole life to teaching and never never marry because you are paid a salary for teaching but a husband wont pay you anything and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money
i expect jane_andrews speaks from mournful experience for mrs_rachel_lynde says that her father is a perfect old crank and meaner than second skimmings
josie_pye says she is just going to college for education sake because she wont have to earn her own living she says of course it is different with orphan who are living on charity they have to hustle
moody_spurgeon_macpherson is going to be a minister mrs_rachel_lynde says he couldnt be anything else with a name like that to live up to
i hope it isnt wicked of me miss_marilla_cuthbert but really the thought of moody_spurgeon_macpherson being a minister makes me laugh
he such a funny looking boy with that big fat face and his little blue eye and his ears sticking out like flaps
charlie_sloane says he going to go into politics and be a member of parliament but mrs_rachel_lynde says he ll never succeed at that because the sloanes are all honest people and it only rascals that get on in politics nowadays
but perhaps he will be more intellectual looking when he grows up what is gilbert_blythe going to be queried miss_marilla_cuthbert seeing that anne_shirley was opening her caesar
i dont happen to know what gilbert_blythe ambition in life is if he has any said anne_shirley scornfully there was open rivalry between gilbert_blythe and anne_shirley now
previously the rivalry had been rather one sided but there was no longer any doubt that gilbert_blythe was as determined to be first in class as anne_shirley was
he was a foeman worthy of her steel the other members of the class tacitly acknowledged their superiority and never dreamed of trying to compete with them
since the day by the pond when she had refused to listen to his plea for forgiveness gilbert_blythe save for the aforesaid determined rivalry had evinced no recognition whatever of the existence of anne_shirley
he talked and jested with the other girl exchanged book and puzzles with them discussed lesson and plans sometimes walked home with one or the other of them from prayer meeting or debating club
but anne_shirley he simply ignored and anne_shirley found out that it is not pleasant to be ignored it was in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head that she did not care
deep down in her wayward feminine little heart she knew that she did care and that if she had that chance of the lake of shining waters again she would answer very differently
all at once as it seemed and to her secret dismay she found that the old resentment she had cherished against him was gone gone just when she most needed its sustaining power
it was in vain that she recalled every incident and emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel the old satisfying anger
that day by the pond had witnessed its last spasmodic flicker anne_shirley realized that she had forgiven and forgotten without knowing it
and at least neither gilbert_blythe nor anybody else not even diana_barry should ever suspect how sorry she was and how much she wished she hadnt been so proud and horrid
she determined to shroud her feeling in deepest oblivion and it may be stated here and now that she did it so successfully that gilbert_blythe who possibly was not quite so indifferent as he seemed could not console himself with any belief that anne_shirley felt his retaliatory scorn
but it was too late the only poor comfort he had was that she snubbed charlie_sloane unmercifully continually and undeservedly
otherwise the winter passed away in a round of pleasant duties and studies for anne_shirley the day slipped by like golden beads on the necklace of the year
she was happy eager interested there were lesson to be learned and honor to be won delightful book to read new pieces to be practiced for the sunday school choir pleasant saturday afternoon at the manse with mrs_allan and then almost before anne_shirley realized it spring had come again to green gables and all the world was abloom once more
studies palled just a wee bit then the queen class left behind in school while the others scattered to green lane and leafy wood cuts and meadow byways looked wistfully out of the window and discovered that latin verbs and french exercises had somehow lost the tang and zest they had possessed in the crisp winter months
even anne_shirley and gilbert_blythe lagged and grew indifferent teacher and taught were alike glad when the term was ended and the glad vacation day stretched rosily before them
but you ve done good work this past year miss_stacy told them on the last evening and you deserve a good jolly vacation
have the best time you can in the out of door world and lay in a good stock of health and vitality and ambition to carry you through next year
it will be the tug of war you know the last year before the entrance are you going to be back next year miss_stacy asked josie_pye
josie_pye never scrupled to ask questions in this instance the rest of the class felt grateful to her none of them would have dared to ask it of miss_stacy but all wanted to for there had been alarming rumors running at large through the school for some time that miss_stacy was not coming back the next year that she had been offered a position in the grade school of her own home district and meant to accept
the queen class listened in breathless suspense for her answer yes i think i will said miss_stacy i thought of taking another school but i have decided to come back to avonlea
to tell the truth i ve grown so interested in my pupils here that i found i couldnt leave them so i ll stay and see you through
moody_spurgeon_macpherson had never been so carried away by his feeling before and he blushed uncomfortably every time he thought about it for a week
hurrah said moody_spurgeon_macpherson oh i so glad said anne_shirley with shining eye dear miss_stacy it would be perfectly dreadful if you didnt come back
i dont believe i could have the heart to go on with my studies at all if another teacher came here
when anne_shirley got home that night she stacked all her textbooks away in an old trunk in the attic locked it and threw the key into the blanket box
i not even going to look at a schoolbook in vacation she told miss_marilla_cuthbert i ve studied as hard all the term as i possibly could
and i ve pored over that geometry until i know every proposition in the first book off by heart even when the letters are changed
i just feel tired of everything sensible and i going to let my imagination run riot for the summer oh you neednt be alarmed miss_marilla_cuthbert
i ll only let it run riot within reasonable limits but i want to have a real good jolly time this summer for maybe it the last summer
mrs_rachel_lynde says that if i keep stretching out next year as i ve done this i ll have to put on longer skirts
and when i put on longer skirts i shall feel that i have to live up to them and be very dignified
i ll be a little girl she says i all running to legs and eye it wont even do to believe in fairies then
i afraid so i going to believe in them with all my whole heart this summer i think we re going to have a very gay vacation
ruby_gillis is going to have a birthday party soon and there the sunday school picnic and the missionary concert next month
and mr diana_barry says that some evening he ll take diana_barry and me over to the white sands hotel and have dinner there
jane_andrews was over once last summer and she says it was a dazzling sight to see the electric lights and the flower and all the lady guests in such beautiful dress
they have dinner there in the evening you know jane_andrews says it was her first glimpse into high life and she ll never forget it to her dying day
mrs_rachel_lynde came up the next afternoon to find out why miss_marilla_cuthbert had not been at the aid meeting on thursday
when miss_marilla_cuthbert was not at aid meeting people knew there was something wrong at green gables matthew_cuthbert had a bad spell with his heart thursday miss_marilla_cuthbert explained and i didnt feel like leaving him
oh yes he all right again now but he takes them spells oftener than he used to and i anxious about him
that easy enough for matthew_cuthbert doesnt go about looking for excitement by any means and never did but he not to do any very heavy work either
the doctor says he must be careful to avoid excitement and you might as well tell matthew_cuthbert not to breathe as not to work
well seeing you re so pressing perhaps i might as well stay said mrs_rachel_lynde who had not the slightest intention of doing anything else
mrs_rachel_lynde and miss_marilla_cuthbert sat comfortably in the parlor while anne_shirley got the tea and made hot biscuits that were light and white enough to defy even mrs_rachel_lynde criticism
i must say anne_shirley has turned out a real smart girl admitted mrs_rachel_lynde as miss_marilla_cuthbert accompanied her to the end of the lane at sunset
come and lay off your thing mrs_rachel_lynde you ll stay to tea she must be a great help to you
i used to be afraid she never get over her featherbrained way but she has and i wouldnt be afraid to trust her in anything now
i never would have thought she have turned out so well that first day i was here three year ago said mrs_rachel_lynde
she is said miss_marilla_cuthbert and she real steady and reliable now lawful heart shall i ever forget that tantrum of hers
when i went home that night i says to mrs_thomas says i mark my word mrs_thomas miss_marilla_cuthbert ll live to rue the step she took
i aint one of those kind of people miss_marilla_cuthbert as can never be brought to own up that they ve made a mistake
i did make a mistake in judging anne_shirley but it werent no wonder for an odder unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in this world that what
but i was mistaken and i real glad of it no that never was my way thank goodness there was no ciphering her out by the rules that worked with other child
she a real pretty girl got to be though i cant say i overly partial to that pale big eyed style myself
it nothing short of wonderful how she improved these three year but especially in look i like more snap and color like diana_barry has or ruby_gillis
but somehow i dont know how it is but when anne_shirley and them are together though she aint half as handsome she makes them look kind of common and overdone something like them white june lilies she calls narcissus alongside of the big red peonies that what
ruby_gillis look are real showy chapter xxxi where the brook and river meet anne_shirley had her good summer and enjoyed it wholeheartedly
she and diana_barry fairly lived outdoors reveling in all the delights that lover lane and the dryad bubble and willowmere and victoria island afforded
minnie_may had the croup met anne_shirley at the house of a patient one afternoon early in vacation looked her over sharply screwed up his mouth shook his head and sent a message to miss_marilla_cuthbert by another person
it was keep that redheaded girl of yours in the open air all summer and dont let her read book until she gets more spring into her step
miss_marilla_cuthbert offered no objections to anne_shirley gypsyings the spencervale doctor who had come the night this message frightened miss_marilla_cuthbert wholesomely
she read anne_shirley death warrant by consumption in it unless it was scrupulously obeyed as a result anne_shirley had the golden summer of her life as far as freedom and frolic went
she walked rowed berried and dreamed to her heart content and when september came she was bright eyed and alert with a step that would have satisfied the spencervale doctor and a heart full of ambition and zest once more
i feel just like studying with might and main she declared as she brought her book down from the attic
i ve had a perfectly beautiful summer miss_marilla_cuthbert and now i rejoicing as a strong man to run a race as mr_allan said last sunday
oh you good old friend i glad to see your honest face once more yes even you geometry doesnt mr_allan preach magnificent sermons
mrs_rachel_lynde says he is improving every day and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up and then we ll be left and have to turn to and break in another green preacher
but i dont see the use of meeting trouble halfway do you miss_marilla_cuthbert i think it would be better just to enjoy mr_allan while we have him
they can have such an influence for good if their theology is sound and it must be thrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers heart
if i were a man i think i be a minister why cant woman be minister miss_marilla_cuthbert i asked mrs_rachel_lynde that
she said there might be female minister in the states and she believed there was but thank goodness we hadnt got to that stage in canada yet
and she was shocked and said it would be a scandalous thing and she hoped we never would but i dont see why
when there is a social to be got up or a church tea or anything else to raise money the woman have to turn to and do the work
i think woman would make splendid minister i sure mrs_rachel_lynde can pray every bit as well as superintendent mr_william_bell and i ve no doubt she could preach too with a little practice
yes i believe she could said miss_marilla_cuthbert dryly she does plenty of unofficial preaching as it is nobody has much of a chance to go wrong in avonlea with mrs_rachel_lynde to oversee them
miss_marilla_cuthbert said anne_shirley in a burst of confidence i want to tell you something and ask you what you think about it
it has worried me terribly on sunday afternoon that is when i think specially about such matter i do really want to be good and when i with you or mrs_allan or miss_stacy
i want it more than ever and i want to do just what would please you and what you would approve of
but mostly when i with mrs_rachel_lynde i feel desperately wicked and as if i wanted to go and do the very thing she tells me
i oughtnt to do i feel irresistibly tempted to do it now what do you think is the reason i feel like that
do you think it because i really bad and unregenerate miss_marilla_cuthbert looked dubious for a moment then she laughed
i sometimes think she have more of an influence for good as you say yourself if she didnt keep nagging people to do right
if you are i guess i am too anne_shirley for mrs_rachel_lynde often has that very effect on me there should have been a special commandment against nagging
but there i shouldnt talk so mrs_rachel_lynde is a good christian woman and she means well there isnt a kinder soul in avonlea and she never shirks her share of work
i very glad you feel the same said anne_shirley decidedly it so encouraging i shant worry so much over that after this
but i dare say there ll be other thing to worry me they keep coming up new all the time thing to perplex you you know
you settle one question and there another right after there are so many thing to be thought over and decided when you re beginning to grow up
it keeps me busy all the time thinking them over and deciding what is right it a serious thing to grow up isnt it miss_marilla_cuthbert
but when i have such good friend as you and matthew_cuthbert and mrs_allan and miss_stacy i ought to grow up successfully and i sure it will be my own fault if i dont
i feel it a great responsibility because i have only the one chance if i dont grow up right i cant go back and begin over again
i ve grown two inches this summer miss_marilla_cuthbert mr ruby_gillis measured me at ruby_gillis party i so glad you made my new dress longer
of course i know it wasnt really necessary but flounces are so stylish this fall and josie_pye has flounces on all her dress
that dark green one is so pretty and it was sweet of you to put on the flounce i know i ll be able to study better because of mine
i shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my mind about that flounce it worth something to have that admitted miss_marilla_cuthbert
especially did the queen class gird up their loins for the fray for at the end of the coming year dimly shadowing their pathway already loomed up that fateful thing known as the entrance at the thought of which one and all felt their heart sink into their very shoes
miss_stacy came back to avonlea school and found all her pupils eager for work once more suppose they did not pass
that thought was doomed to haunt anne_shirley through the waking hour of that winter sunday afternoon inclusive to the almost entire exclusion of moral and theological problems
when anne_shirley had bad dream she found herself staring miserably at pass lists of the entrance exams where gilbert_blythe name was blazoned at the top and in which hers did not appear at all
new world of thought feeling and ambition fresh fascinating field of unexplored knowledge seemed to be opening out before anne_shirley eager eye
but it was a jolly busy happy swift flying winter schoolwork was as interesting class rivalry as absorbing as of yore
hill peeped er hill and alps on alps arose much of all this was due to miss_stacy tactful careful broadminded guidance
she led her class to think and explore and discover for themselves and encouraged straying from the old beaten paths to a degree that quite shocked mrs_rachel_lynde and the school trustees who viewed all innovations on established methods rather dubiously
the debating club flourished and gave several concert there were one or two parties almost verging on grown up affairs there were sleigh drives and skating frolics galore
between time anne_shirley grew shooting up so rapidly that miss_marilla_cuthbert was astonished one day when they were standing side by side to find the girl was taller than herself
apart from her studies anne_shirley expanded socially for miss_marilla_cuthbert mindful of the spencervale doctor dictum no longer vetoed occasional outings
why anne_shirley how you ve grown she said almost unbelievingly a sigh followed on the word miss_marilla_cuthbert felt a queer regret over anne_shirley inches
the child she had learned to love had vanished somehow and here was this tall serious eyed girl of fifteen with the thoughtful brows and the proudly poised little head in her place
miss_marilla_cuthbert loved the girl as much as she had loved the child but she was conscious of a queer sorrowful sense of loss
and that night when anne_shirley had gone to prayer meeting with diana_barry miss_marilla_cuthbert sat alone in the wintry twilight and indulged in the weakness of a cry
matthew_cuthbert coming in with a lantern caught her at it and gazed at her in such consternation that miss_marilla_cuthbert had to laugh through her tear
i was thinking about anne_shirley she explained she got to be such a big girl and she ll probably be away from us next winter
she ll be able to come home often comforted matthew_cuthbert to whom anne_shirley was as yet and always would be the little eager girl he had brought home from bright river on that june evening four year before
it wont be the same thing as having her here all the time sighed miss_marilla_cuthbert gloomily determined to enjoy her luxury of grief uncomforted
i ll miss her terrible the branch railroad will be built to carmody by that time but there man cant understand these thing
there were other changes in anne_shirley no less real than the physical change for one thing she became much quieter
perhaps she thought all the more and dreamed as much as ever but she certainly talked less miss_marilla_cuthbert noticed and commented on this also
you dont chatter half as much as you used to anne_shirley nor use half as many big word what has come over you
anne_shirley colored and laughed a little as she dropped her book and looked dreamily out of the window where big fat red buds were bursting out on the creeper in response to the lure of the spring sunshine
i dont know i dont want to talk as much she said denting her chin thoughtfully with her forefinger it nicer to think dear pretty thoughts and keep them in one heart like treasures
i dont like to have them laughed at or wondered over and somehow i dont want to use big word any more
it almost a pity isnt it now that i really growing big enough to say them if i did want to
it fun to be almost grown up in some way but it not the kind of fun i expected miss_marilla_cuthbert there so much to learn and do and think that there isnt time for big word
besides miss_stacy says the short one are much stronger and better she makes us write all our essays as simply as possible
i was so used to crowding in all the fine big word i could think of and i thought of any number of them
it was hard at first but i ve got used to it now and i see it so much better what has become of your story club
i havent heard you speak of it for a long time the story club isnt in existence any longer we hadnt time for it and
anyhow i think we had got tired of it it was silly to be writing about love and murder and elopements and mysteries
miss_stacy sometimes has us write a story for training in composition but she wont let us write anything but what might happen in avonlea in our own life and she criticizes it very sharply and makes us criticize our own too
i never thought my compositions had so many faults until i began to look for them myself i felt so ashamed i wanted to give up altogether but miss_stacy said i could learn to write well
if i only trained myself to be my own severest critic and so i am trying to you ve only two more months before the entrance said miss_marilla_cuthbert
do you think you ll be able to get through anne_shirley shivered i dont know sometimes i think i ll be all right
and then i get horribly afraid we ve studied hard and miss_stacy has drilled us thoroughly but we maynt get through for all that
we ve each got a stumbling block mine is geometry of course and jane_andrews is latin and ruby_gillis and charlie_sloane is algebra and
josie_pye is arithmetic moody_spurgeon_macpherson says he feels it in his bones that he is going to fail in english history
miss_stacy is going to give us examinations in june just as hard as we ll have at the entrance and mark us just as strictly so we ll have some idea
i wish it was all over miss_marilla_cuthbert it haunts me sometimes i wake up in the night and wonder what i ll do if i dont pass
why go to school next year and try again said miss_marilla_cuthbert unconcernedly oh i dont believe i have the heart for it
it would be such a disgrace to fail especially if gil if the others passed and i get so nervous in an examination that i likely to make a mess of it
anne_shirley sighed and dragging her eye from the witcheries of the spring world the beckoning day of breeze and blue and the green thing upspringing in the garden buried herself resolutely in her book
there would be other springs but if she did not succeed in passing the entrance anne_shirley felt convinced that she would never recover sufficiently to enjoy them
i wish i had nerves like jane_andrews nothing rattles her chapter xxxii the pass list is out with the end of june came the close of the term and the close of miss_stacy rule in avonlea school
red eye and damp handkerchiefs bore convincing testimony to the fact that miss_stacy farewell word must have been quite as touching as mr_phillips had been under similar circumstances three year before
anne_shirley and diana_barry walked home that evening feeling very sober indeed diana_barry looked back at the schoolhouse from the foot of the spruce hill and sighed deeply
you oughtnt to feel half as badly as i do said anne_shirley hunting vainly for a dry spot on her handkerchief
it does seem as if it was the end of everything doesnt it she said dismally you ll be back again next winter but i suppose i ve left the dear old school forever
if i have good luck that is it wont be a bit the same miss_stacy wont be there nor you nor jane_andrews nor ruby_gillis probably
i shall have to sit all alone for i couldnt bear to have another deskmate after you oh we have had jolly time havent we anne_shirley
it dreadful to think they re all over two big tear rolled down by diana_barry nose if you would stop crying i could said anne_shirley imploringly
just as soon as i put away my hanky i see you brimming up and that starts me off again
as mrs_rachel_lynde says if you cant be cheerful be as cheerful as you can after all i dare say i ll be back next year
this is one of the time i know i not going to pass they re getting alarmingly frequent why you came out splendidly in the exams miss_stacy gave
yes but those exams didnt make me nervous when i think of the real thing you cant imagine what a horrid cold fluttery feeling comes round my heart
and then my number is thirteen and josie_pye says it so unlucky i am not superstitious and i know it can make no difference
but still i wish it wasnt thirteen i do wish i was going in with you said diana_barry wouldnt we have a perfectly elegant time
but i suppose you ll have to cram in the evening no miss_stacy has made us promise not to open a book at all
she says it would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not think about the exams at all and go to bed early
prissy_andrews told me that she sat up half the night every night of her entrance week and crammed for dear life and i had determined to sit up at least as long as she did
it good advice but i expect it will be hard to follow good advice is apt to be i think it was so kind of your aunt miss_josephine_barry to ask me to stay at beechwood while i in town
you ll write to me while you re in wont you i ll write tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes promised anne_shirley
anne_shirley went to town the following monday and on wednesday diana_barry haunted the post office as agreed and got her letter
i ll be haunting the post office wednesday vowed diana_barry dearest diana_barry wrote anne_shirley here it is tuesday night and i writing this in the library at beechwood
i couldnt cram because i promised miss_stacy not to but it was as hard to keep from opening my history as it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lesson were learned
this morning miss_stacy came for me and we went to the academy calling for jane_andrews and ruby_gillis and josie_pye on our way
last night i was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and wished so much you were with me ruby_gillis asked me to feel her hand and they were as cold as ice
and she didnt believe i was strong enough to stand the grind of the teacher course even if i did get through
there are time and seasons even yet when i dont feel that i ve made any great headway in learning to like josie_pye
josie_pye said i looked as if i hadnt slept a wink when we reached the academy there were scores of students there from all over the island
the first person we saw was moody_spurgeon_macpherson sitting on the steps and muttering away to himself jane_andrews asked him what on earth he was doing
and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over and over to steady his nerves and for pity sake not to interrupt him because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot everything he ever knew but the multiplication table kept all his facts firmly in their proper place
when we were assigned to our room miss_stacy had to leave us jane_andrews and i sat together and jane_andrews was so composed that i envied her
no need of the multiplication table for good steady sensible jane_andrews i wondered if i looked as i felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear across the room
then a man came in and began distributing the english examination sheets my hand grew cold then and my head fairly whirled around as i picked it up
just one awful moment diana_barry i felt exactly as i did four year ago when i asked miss_marilla_cuthbert if i might stay at green gables and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began beating again
i forgot to say that it had stopped altogether for i knew i could do something with that paper anyhow at noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in the afternoon
the history was a pretty hard paper and i got dreadfully mixed up in the dates still i think i did fairly well today
but oh diana_barry tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when i think of it it takes every bit of determination i possess to keep from opening my euclid
if i thought the multiplication table would help me any i would recite it from now till tomorrow morning i went down to see the other girl this evening
on my way i met moody_spurgeon_macpherson wandering distractedly around he said he knew he had failed in history and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents
and he was going home on the morning train and it would be easier to be a carpenter than a minister anyhow
i cheered him up and persuaded him to stay to the end because it would be unfair to miss_stacy if he didnt
sometimes i have wished i was born a boy but when i see moody_spurgeon_macpherson i always glad i a girl and not his sister
ruby_gillis was in hysterics when i reached their boardinghouse she had just discovered a fearful mistake she had made in her english paper
when she recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream how we wished you had been with us
but there as mrs_rachel_lynde would say the sun will go on rising and setting whether i fail in geometry or not
oh diana_barry if only the geometry examination were over that is true but not especially comforting i think i rather it didnt go on if i failed
yours devotedly anne_shirley the geometry examination and all the others were over in due time and anne_shirley arrived home on friday evening rather tired but with an air of chastened triumph about her
diana_barry was over at green gables when she arrived and they met as if they had been parted for year
you old darling it perfectly splendid to see you back again it seems like an age since you went to town
and oh anne_shirley how did you get along pretty well i think in everything but the geometry i dont know whether i passed in it or not
and i have a creepy crawly presentiment that i didnt oh how good it is to be back green gables is the dearest loveliest spot in the world
how did the others do the girl say they know they didnt pass but i think they did pretty well
josie_pye says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it moody_spurgeon_macpherson still thinks he failed in history and charlie_sloane says he failed in algebra
but we dont really know anything about it and wont until the pass list is out that wont be for a fortnight
fancy living a fortnight in such suspense i wish i could go to sleep and never wake up until it is over
diana_barry knew it would be useless to ask how gilbert_blythe had fared so she merely said oh you ll pass all right
i rather not pass at all than not come out pretty well up on the list flashed anne_shirley by which she meant and diana_barry knew she meant that success would be incomplete and bitter if she did not come out ahead of gilbert_blythe
they had met and passed each other on the street a dozen time without any sign of recognition and every time anne_shirley had held her head a little higher and wished a little more earnestly that she had made friend with gilbert_blythe when he asked her and vowed a little more determinedly to surpass him in the examination
she knew that all avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first she even knew that jimmy glover and ned wright had a bet on the question and that josie_pye had said there was no doubt in the world that gilbert_blythe would be first and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable if she failed
dont worry with this end in view anne_shirley had strained every nerve during the examinations so had gilbert_blythe but she had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well
she wanted to pass high for the sake of matthew_cuthbert and miss_marilla_cuthbert especially matthew_cuthbert matthew_cuthbert had declared to her his conviction that she would beat the whole island
but she did hope fervently that she would be among the first ten at least so that she might see matthew_cuthbert kindly brown eye gleam with pride in her achievement
that she felt would be a sweet reward indeed for all her hard work and patient grubbing among unimaginative equations and conjugations
at the end of the fortnight anne_shirley took to haunting the post office also in the distracted company of jane_andrews ruby_gillis and josie_pye opening the charlottetown dailies with shaking hand and cold sinkaway feeling as bad as any experienced during the entrance week
that anne_shirley felt was something it would be foolish to hope for even in the wildest dream charlie_sloane and gilbert_blythe were not above doing this too but moody_spurgeon_macpherson stayed resolutely away
i havent got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood he told anne_shirley
when three week had gone by without the pass list appearing anne_shirley began to feel that she really couldnt stand the strain much longer
i just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me suddenly whether i ve passed or not her appetite failed and her interest in avonlea doings languished
mrs_rachel_lynde wanted to know what else you could expect with a tory superintendent of education at the head of affairs and
matthew_cuthbert noting anne_shirley paleness and indifference and the lagging steps that bore her home from the post office every afternoon began seriously to wonder if he hadnt better vote grit at the next election
anne_shirley was sitting at her open window for the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the world as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk sweet scented with flower breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the stir of poplars
the eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the reflection of the west and anne_shirley was wondering dreamily if the spirit of color looked like that when she saw diana_barry come flying down through the firs over the log bridge and up the slope with a fluttering newspaper in her hand
but one evening the news came anne_shirley sprang to her feet knowing at once what that paper contained the pass list was out
it seemed an hour to her before diana_barry came rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even knocking so great was her excitement
her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt her she could not move a step anne_shirley you ve passed she cried passed the very first you and gilbert_blythe both you re ties but your name is first
oh i so proud diana_barry flung the paper on the table and herself on anne_shirley bed utterly breathless and incapable of further speech
anne_shirley lighted the lamp oversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her shaking hand could accomplish the task
then she snatched up the paper yes she had passed there was her name at the very top of a list of two hundred
you did just splendidly anne_shirley puffed diana_barry recovering sufficiently to sit up and speak for anne_shirley starry eyed and rapt had not uttered a word
father brought the paper home from bright river not ten minute ago it came out on the afternoon train you know and wont be here till tomorrow by mail and when i saw the pass list i just rushed over like a wild thing
that moment was worth living for you ve all passed every one of you moody_spurgeon_macpherson and all although he conditioned in history
josie_pye just scraped through with three marks to spare but you ll see she ll put on as many air as if she led
jane_andrews and ruby_gillis did pretty well they re halfway up and so did charlie_sloane wont miss_stacy be delighted oh anne_shirley what does it feel like to see your name at the head of a pass list like that
if it were me i know i go crazy with joy i am pretty near crazy as it is but you re as calm and cool as a spring evening
i just dazzled inside said anne_shirley i want to say a hundred thing and i cant find word to say them in
i never dreamed of this yes i did too just once i let myself think once what if i should come out first
quakingly you know for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to think i could lead the island excuse me a minute diana_barry
i must run right out to the field to tell matthew_cuthbert then we ll go up the road and tell the good news to the others
they hurried to the hayfield below the barn where matthew_cuthbert was coiling hay and as luck would have it mrs_rachel_lynde was talking to miss_marilla_cuthbert at the lane fence
oh matthew_cuthbert exclaimed anne_shirley i ve passed and i first or one of the first i not vain but i thankful
well now i always said it said matthew_cuthbert gazing at the pass list delightedly i knew you could beat them all easy
you ve done pretty well i must say anne_shirley said miss_marilla_cuthbert trying to hide her extreme pride in anne_shirley from mrs_rachel_lynde critical eye
but that good soul said heartily i just guess she has done well and far be it from me to be backward in saying it
that night anne_shirley who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious little talk with mrs_allan at the manse knelt sweetly by her open window in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude and aspiration that came straight from her heart
there was in it thankfulness for the past and reverent petition for the future and when she slept on her white pillow
you re a credit to your friend anne_shirley that what and we re all proud of you her dream were as fair and bright and beautiful as maidenhood might desire
they were together in the east gable chamber outside it was only twilight a lovely yellowish green twilight with a clear blue cloudless sky
a big round moon slowly deepening from her pallid luster into burnished silver hung over the haunted wood the air was full of sweet summer sounds sleepy birds twittering freakish breezes faraway voice and laughter
chapter xxxiii the hotel concert put on your white organdy by all means anne_shirley advised diana_barry decidedly but in anne_shirley room the blind was drawn and the lamp lighted for an important toilet was being made
the east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that night four year before when anne_shirley had felt its bareness penetrate to the marrow of her spirit with its inhospitable chill
changes had crept in miss_marilla_cuthbert conniving at them resignedly until it was as sweet and dainty a nest as a young girl could desire
the velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of anne_shirley early visions had certainly never materialized but her dream had kept pace with her growth and it is not probable she lamented them
the floor was covered with a pretty matting and the curtains that softened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of pale green art muslin
the walls hung not with gold and silver brocade tapestry but with a dainty apple blossom paper were adorned with a few good pictures given anne_shirley by mrs_allan
miss_stacy photograph occupied the place of honor and anne_shirley made a sentimental point of keeping fresh flower on the bracket under it
there was no mahogany furniture but there was a white painted bookcase filled with book a cushioned wicker rocker a toilet table befrilled with white muslin a quaint gilt framed mirror with chubby pink cupids and purple grapes painted over its arched top that used to hang in the spare room and a low white bed
tonight a spike of white lilies faintly perfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance anne_shirley was dressing for a concert at the white sands hotel
the guests had got it up in aid of the charlottetown hospital and had hunted out all the available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it along
bertha sampson and pearl clay of the white sands baptist choir had been asked to sing a duet milton clark of newbridge was to give a violin solo winnie adella blair of carmody was to sing a scotch ballad and laura mrs_alexander_spencer of spencervale and anne_shirley of avonlea were to recite
as anne_shirley would have said at one time it was an epoch in her life and she was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it
matthew_cuthbert was in the seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his anne_shirley and miss_marilla_cuthbert was not far behind although she would have died rather than admit it and said she didnt think it was very proper for a lot of young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible person with them
anne_shirley and diana_barry were to drive over with jane_andrews and her brother billy in their double seated buggy and several other avonlea girl and boy were going too
there was a party of visitors expected out from town and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers
do you really think the organdy will be best queried anne_shirley anxiously i dont think it as pretty as my blue flowered muslin and it certainly isnt so fashionable
but it suits you ever so much better said diana_barry it so soft and frilly and clinging the muslin is stiff and makes you look too dressed up
diana_barry was beginning to have a reputation for notable taste in dressing and her advice on such subjects was much sought after
she was looking very pretty herself on this particular night in a dress of the lovely wild rose pink from which anne_shirley was forever debarred but she was not to take any part in the concert so her appearance was of minor importance
all her pains were bestowed upon anne_shirley who she vowed must for the credit of avonlea be dressed and combed and adorned to the queen taste
but the organdy seems as if it grew on you anne_shirley sighed and yielded pull out that frill a little more so here let me tie your sash now for your slippers
i going to braid your hair in two thick braids and tie them halfway up with big white bows no dont pull out a single curl over your forehead just have the soft part
there is no way you do your hair suits you so well anne_shirley and mrs_allan says you look like a madonna when you part it so
i shall fasten this little white house rose just behind your ear there was just one on my bush and i saved it for you
shall i put my pearl beads on asked anne_shirley matthew_cuthbert brought me a string from town last week and i know he like to see them on me
diana_barry pursed up her lips put her black head on one side critically and finally pronounced in favor of the beads which were thereupon tied around anne_shirley slim milk white throat
there something so stylish about you anne_shirley said diana_barry with unenvious admiration you hold your head with such an air
i suppose it your figure i am just a dumpling i ve always been afraid of it and now i know it is so
well i suppose i shall just have to resign myself to it but you have such dimples said anne_shirley smiling affectionately into the pretty vivacious face so near her own
lovely dimples like little dents in cream i have given up all hope of dimples my dimple dream will never come true but so many of my dream have that i mustnt complain
all ready assured diana_barry as miss_marilla_cuthbert appeared in the doorway a gaunt figure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles but with a much softer face
am i all ready now come right in and look at our elocutionist miss_marilla_cuthbert doesnt she look lovely miss_marilla_cuthbert emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt
but i expect she ll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew with it and it look most too thin for these damp night
she look neat and proper i like that way of fixing her hair organdy the most unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow and i told matthew_cuthbert so when he got it
time was when he would take my advice but now he just buys thing for anne_shirley regardless and the clerks at carmody know they can palm anything off on him
but there is no use in saying anything to matthew_cuthbert nowadays just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable and matthew_cuthbert plunks his money down for it
then miss_marilla_cuthbert stalked downstairs thinking proudly how sweet anne_shirley looked with that one moonbeam from the forehead to the crown and regretting that she could not go to the concert herself to hear her girl recite
mind you keep your skirt clear of the wheel anne_shirley and put your warm jacket on i wonder if it is too damp for my dress said anne_shirley anxiously
not a bit of it said diana_barry pulling up the window blind it a perfect night and there wont be any dew
look at the moonlight i so glad my window look east into the sun rising said anne_shirley going over to diana_barry
it so splendid to see the morning coming up over those long hill and glowing through those sharp fir tops
it new every morning and i feel as if i washed my very soul in that bath of earliest sunshine oh diana_barry i love this little room so dearly
i dont know how i ll get along without it when i go to town next month dont speak of your going away tonight begged diana_barry
i dont want to think of it it makes me so miserable and i do want to have a good time this evening
what are you going to recite anne_shirley and are you nervous not a bit i ve recited so often in public
i dont mind at all now i ve decided to give the maiden vow it so pathetic laura mrs_alexander_spencer is going to give a comic recitation but i rather make people cry than laugh
they wont dream of encoring me scoffed anne_shirley who was not without her own secret hopes that they would and already visioned herself telling matthew_cuthbert all about it at the next morning breakfast table
what will you recite if they encore you there are billy and jane_andrews now i hear the wheels come on
she would have much preferred to sit back with the girl where she could have laughed and chattered to her heart content
billy andrews insisted that anne_shirley should ride on the front seat with him so she unwillingly climbed up there was not much of either laughter or chatter in billy
he was a big fat stolid youth of twenty with a round expressionless face and a painful lack of conversational gifts
but he admired anne_shirley immensely and was puffed up with pride over the prospect of driving to white sands with that slim upright figure beside him
anne_shirley by dint of talking over her shoulder to the girl and occasionally passing a sop of civility to billy who grinned and chuckled and never could think of any reply until it was too late contrived to enjoy the drive in spite of all
it was a night for enjoyment the road was full of buggies all bound for the hotel and laughter silver clear echoed and reechoed along it
they were met by the lady of the concert committee one of whom took anne_shirley off to the performers dressing room which was filled with the members of a charlottetown symphony club among whom anne_shirley felt suddenly shy and frightened and countrified
her dress which in the east gable had seemed so dainty and pretty now seemed simple and plain too simple and plain she thought among all the silks and laces that glistened and rustled around her
when they reached the hotel it was a blaze of light from top to bottom what were her pearl beads compared to the diamonds of the big handsome lady near her
and how poor her one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse flower the others wore anne_shirley laid her hat and jacket away and shrank miserably into a corner
she wished herself back in the white room at green gables it was still worse on the platform of the big concert hall of the hotel where she presently found herself
she wished she were sitting down in the audience with diana_barry and jane_andrews who seemed to be having a splendid time away at the back
the electric lights dazzled her eye the perfume and hum bewildered her she was wedged in between a stout lady in pink silk and a tall scornful looking girl in a white lace dress
the stout lady occasionally turned her head squarely around and surveyed anne_shirley through her eyeglasses until anne_shirley acutely sensitive of being so scrutinized felt that she must scream aloud and the white lace girl kept talking audibly to her next neighbor about the country bumpkins and rustic belles in the audience languidly anticipating such fun from the displays of local talent on the program
anne_shirley believed that she would hate that white lace girl to the end of life unfortunately for anne_shirley a professional elocutionist was staying at the hotel and had consented to recite
she was a lithe dark eyed woman in a wonderful gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams with gems on her neck and in her dark hair
anne_shirley forgetting all about herself and her trouble for the time listened with rapt and shining eye but when the recitation ended she suddenly put her hand over her face
she had a marvelously flexible voice and wonderful power of expression the audience went wild over her selection she could never get up and recite after that never
had she ever thought she could recite oh if she were only back at green gables at this unpropitious moment her name was called
somehow anne_shirley who did not notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white lace girl gave and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied therein if she had got on her feet and moved dizzily out to the front
she was so pale that diana_barry and jane_andrews down in the audience clasped each other hand in nervous sympathy anne_shirley was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright
often as she had recited in public she had never before faced such an audience as this and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely
everything was so strange so brilliant so bewildering the rows of lady in evening dress the critical face the whole atmosphere of wealth and culture about her
very different this from the plain benches at the debating club filled with the homely sympathetic face of friend and neighbors
these people she thought would be merciless critics perhaps like the white lace girl they anticipated amusement from her rustic efforts she felt hopelessly helplessly ashamed and miserable
her knees trembled her heart fluttered a horrible faintness came over her not a word could she utter and the next moment she would have fled from the platform despite the humiliation which she felt must ever after be her portion if she did so
but suddenly as her dilated frightened eye gazed out over the audience she saw gilbert_blythe away at the back of the room bending forward with a smile on his face a smile which seemed to anne_shirley at once triumphant and taunting
gilbert_blythe was merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and of the effect produced by anne_shirley slender white form and spiritual face against a background of palms in particular
in reality it was nothing of the kind josie_pye whom he had driven over sat beside him and her face certainly was both triumphant and taunting
she drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly courage and determination tingling over her like an electric shock
but anne_shirley did not see josie_pye and would not have cared if she had she would not fail before gilbert_blythe he should never be able to laugh at her never never
her fright and nervousness vanished and she began her recitation her clear sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of the room without a tremor or a break
self possession was fully restored to her and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness she recited as she had never done before
anne_shirley stepping back to her seat blushing with shyness and delight found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken by the stout lady in pink silk
when she finished there were bursts of honest applause my dear you did splendidly she puffed i ve been crying like a baby actually i have
there they re encoring you they re bound to have you back oh i cant go said anne_shirley confusedly but yet i must or matthew_cuthbert will be disappointed
he said they would encore me then dont disappoint matthew_cuthbert said the pink lady laughing smiling blushing limpid eyed anne_shirley tripped back and gave a quaint funny little selection that captivated her audience still further
when the concert was over the stout pink lady who was the wife of an american millionaire took her under her wing and introduced her to everybody and everybody was very nice to her
the professional elocutionist mrs evans came and chatted with her telling her that she had a charming voice and interpreted her selections beautifully
the rest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her even the white lace girl paid her a languid little compliment
they had supper in the big beautifully decorated dining room diana_barry and jane_andrews were invited to partake of this also since they had come with anne_shirley but billy was nowhere to be found having decamped in mortal fear of some such invitation
he was in waiting for them with the team however when it was all over and the three girl came merrily out into the calm white moonshine radiance
anne_shirley breathed deeply and looked into the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs oh it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night
how great and still and wonderful everything was with the murmur of the sea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants guarding enchanted coasts
i just wish i was a rich american and could spend my summer at a hotel and wear jewels and low necked dress and have ice cream and chicken salad every blessed day
hasnt it been a perfectly splendid time sighed jane_andrews as they drove away i sure it would be ever so much more fun than teaching school
anne_shirley your recitation was simply great although i thought at first you were never going to begin i think it was better than mrs evans
it couldnt be better than mrs evans you know for she is a professional and i only a schoolgirl with a little knack of reciting
oh no dont say thing like that jane_andrews said anne_shirley quickly because it sounds silly i quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty well
i ve a compliment for you anne_shirley said diana_barry at least i think it must be a compliment because of the tone he said it in
part of it was anyhow there was an american sitting behind jane_andrews and me such a romantic looking man with coal black hair and eye
josie_pye says he is a distinguished artist and that her mother cousin in boston is married to a man that used to go to school with him
well we heard him say didnt we jane_andrews who is that girl on the platform with the splendid titian hair she has a face i should like to paint
there now anne_shirley but what does titian hair mean being interpreted it means plain red i guess laughed anne_shirley titian was a very famous artist who liked to paint red haired woman
did you see all the diamonds those lady wore sighed jane_andrews they were simply dazzling wouldnt you just love to be rich girl
why we have sixteen year to our credit and we re happy as queens and we ve all got imagination more or less
we are rich said anne_shirley staunchly look at that sea girl all silver and shadow and vision of thing not seen
we couldnt enjoy its loveliness any more if we had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds you wouldnt change into any of those woman if you could
would you want to be that white lace girl and wear a sour look all your life as if you been born turning up your nose at the world
or the pink lady kind and nice as she is so stout and short that you really no figure at all
or even mrs evans with that sad sad look in her eye she must have been dreadfully unhappy sometime to have such a look
you know you wouldnt jane_andrews i dont know exactly said jane_andrews unconvinced i think diamonds would comfort a person for a good deal
well i dont want to be anyone but myself even if i go uncomforted by diamonds all my life declared anne_shirley
i quite content to be anne_shirley of green gables with my string of pearl beads i know matthew_cuthbert gave me as much love with them as ever went with madame the pink lady jewels
a queen girl the next three week were busy one at green gables for anne_shirley was getting ready to go to queen and there was much sewing to be done and many thing to be talked over and arranged
anne_shirley outfit was ample and pretty for matthew_cuthbert saw to that and miss_marilla_cuthbert for once made no objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested
chapter xxxiv more one evening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate pale green material
i dont suppose you really need it you ve plenty of pretty waists but i thought maybe you like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere of an evening in town to a party or anything like that
i hear that jane_andrews and ruby_gillis and josie_pye have got evening dress as they call them and i dont mean you shall be behind them
i got mrs_allan to help me pick it in town last week and we ll get emily ruby_gillis to make it for you
anne_shirley here something for a nice light dress for you emily has got taste and her fits arent to be equaled
i dont believe you ought to be so kind to me it making it harder every day for me to go away
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert it just lovely said anne_shirley thank you so much the green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as emily taste permitted
anne_shirley put it on one evening for matthew_cuthbert and miss_marilla_cuthbert benefit and recited the maiden vow for them in the kitchen
as miss_marilla_cuthbert watched the bright animated face and graceful motions her thoughts went back to the evening anne_shirley had arrived at green gables and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd frightened child in her preposterous yellowish brown wincey dress the heartbreak looking out of her tearful eye
i declare my recitation has made you cry miss_marilla_cuthbert said anne_shirley gaily stooping over miss_marilla_cuthbert chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady cheek
no i wasnt crying over your piece said miss_marilla_cuthbert who would have scorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff
something in the memory brought tear to miss_marilla_cuthbert own eye now i call that a positive triumph
i just couldnt help thinking of the little girl you used to be anne_shirley and i was wishing you could have stayed a little girl even with all your queer way
you ve grown up now and you re going away and you look so tall and stylish and so so different altogether in that dress as if you didnt belong in avonlea at all and i just got lonesome thinking it all over
anne_shirley sat down on miss_marilla_cuthbert gingham lap took miss_marilla_cuthbert lined face between her hand and looked gravely and tenderly into miss_marilla_cuthbert eye
miss_marilla_cuthbert i not a bit changed not really i only just pruned down and branched out the real me back here is just the same
it wont make a bit of difference where i go or how much i change outwardly at heart i shall always be your little anne_shirley who will love you and matthew_cuthbert and dear green gables more and better every day of her life
miss_marilla_cuthbert would have given much just then to have possessed anne_shirley power of putting her feeling into word but nature and habit had willed it otherwise and she could only put her arms close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart wishing that she need never let her go
anne_shirley laid her fresh young cheek against miss_marilla_cuthbert faded one and reached out a hand to pat matthew_cuthbert shoulder matthew_cuthbert with a suspicious moisture in his eye got up and went out of door
under the stars of the blue summer night he walked agitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars
well now i guess she aint been much spoiled he muttered proudly i guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all
she been a blessing to us and there never was a luckier mistake than what mrs_alexander_spencer made if it was luck
she smart and pretty and loving too which is better than all the rest i dont believe it was any such thing
it was providence because the almighty saw we needed her i reckon the day finally came when anne_shirley must go to town
she and matthew_cuthbert drove in one fine september morning after a tearful parting with diana_barry and an untearful practical one on miss_marilla_cuthbert side at least with miss_marilla_cuthbert
but when anne_shirley had gone diana_barry dried her tear and went to a beach picnic at white sands with some of her carmody cousins where she contrived to enjoy herself tolerably well while miss_marilla_cuthbert plunged fiercely into unnecessary work and kept at it all day long with the bitterest kind of heartache the ache that burns and gnaws and cannot wash itself away in ready tear
but that night when miss_marilla_cuthbert went to bed acutely and miserably conscious that the little gable room at the end of the hall was untenanted by any vivid young life and unstirred by any soft breathing she buried her face in her pillow and wept for her girl in a passion of sobs that appalled her when she grew calm enough to reflect how very wicked it must be to take on so about a sinful fellow creature
that first day passed pleasantly enough in a whirl of excitement meeting all the new students learning to know the professors by sight and being assorted and organized into class
anne_shirley intended taking up the second year work being advised to do so by miss_stacy gilbert_blythe elected to do the same
this meant getting a first class teacher license in one year instead of two if they were successful but it also meant much more and harder work
jane_andrews ruby_gillis josie_pye charlie_sloane and moody_spurgeon_macpherson not being troubled with the stirrings of ambition were content to take up the second class work
anne_shirley was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in a room with fifty other students not one of whom she knew except the tall brown haired boy across the room and knowing him in the fashion she did did not help her much as she reflected pessimistically
yet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class the old rivalry could still be carried on and anne_shirley would hardly have known what to do if it had been lacking
anne_shirley and the rest of the avonlea scholars reached town just in time to hurry off to the academy i wouldnt feel comfortable without it she thought
gilbert_blythe look awfully determined i suppose he making up his mind here and now to win the medal what a splendid chin he has
i never noticed it before i do wish jane_andrews and ruby_gillis had gone in for first class too i suppose i wont feel so much like a cat in a strange garret when i get acquainted though
of course i promised diana_barry that no queen girl no matter how much i liked her should ever be as dear to me as she is but i ve lot of second best affections to bestow
i wonder which of the girl here are going to be my friend it really an interesting speculation i like the look of that girl with the brown eye and the crimson waist
she look vivid and red rosy there that pale fair one gazing out of the window she has lovely hair and look as if she knew a thing or two about dream
i like to know them both know them well well enough to walk with my arm about their waists and call them nicknames
but just now i dont know them and they dont know me and probably dont want to know me particularly oh it lonesome
it was lonesomer still when anne_shirley found herself alone in her hall bedroom that night at twilight she was not to board with the other girl who all had relatives in town to take pity on them
miss miss_josephine_barry diana_barry would have liked to board her but beechwood was so far from the academy that it was out of the question so miss diana_barry hunted up a boarding house assuring matthew_cuthbert and miss_marilla_cuthbert that it was the very place for anne_shirley
the lady who keeps it is a reduced gentlewoman explained miss diana_barry her husband was a british officer and she is very careful what sort of boarders she takes
anne_shirley will not meet with any objectionable person under her roof the table is good and the house is near the academy in a quiet neighborhood
all this might be quite true and indeed proved to be so but it did not materially help anne_shirley in the first agony of homesickness that seized upon her
she looked dismally about her narrow little room with its dull papered pictureless walls its small iron bedstead and empty book case and a horrible choke came into her throat as she thought of her own white room at green gables where she would have the pleasant consciousness of a great green still outdoors of sweet peas growing in the garden and moonlight falling on the orchard of the brook below the slope and the spruce boughs tossing in the night wind beyond it of a vast starry sky and the light from diana_barry window shining out through the gap in the tree
here there was nothing of this anne_shirley knew that outside of her window was a hard street with a network of telephone wires shutting out the sky the tramp of alien feet and a thousand lights gleaming on stranger face
she knew that she was going to cry and fought against it i wont cry it silly and weak there the third tear splashing down by my nose
there are more coming i must think of something funny to stop them but there nothing funny except what is connected with avonlea and that only makes thing worse four five
i going home next friday but that seems a hundred year away oh matthew_cuthbert is nearly home by now and miss_marilla_cuthbert is at the gate looking down the lane for him six seven eight
oh there no use in counting them they re coming in a flood presently i cant cheer up i dont want to cheer up
it nicer to be miserable the flood of tear would have come no doubt had not josie_pye appeared at that moment
in the joy of seeing a familiar face anne_shirley forgot that there had never been much love lost between her and josie_pye
as a part of avonlea life even a josie_pye was welcome i so glad you came up anne_shirley said sincerely
you ve been crying remarked josie_pye with aggravating pity i suppose you re homesick some people have so little self control in that respect
i ve no intention of being homesick i can tell you town too jolly after that poky old avonlea i wonder how i ever existed there so long
you shouldnt cry anne_shirley it isnt becoming for your nose and eye get red and then you seem all red i a perfectly scrumptious time in the academy today
our french professor is simply a duck his moustache would give you kerwollowps of the heart have you anything eatable around anne_shirley
i literally starving ah i guessed likely miss_marilla_cuthbert load you up with cake that why i called round otherwise i have gone to the park to hear the band play with frank stockley
he boards same place as i do and he a sport he noticed you in class today and asked me who the red headed girl was
i told him you were an orphan that the cuthberts had adopted and nobody knew very much about what you been before that
anne_shirley was wondering if after all solitude and tear were not more satisfactory than josie_pye companionship when jane_andrews and ruby_gillis appeared each with an inch of queen color ribbon purple and scarlet pinned proudly to her coat
as josie_pye was not speaking to jane_andrews just then she had to subside into comparative harmlessness well said jane_andrews with a sigh i feel as if i lived many moons since the morning
i ought to be home studying my virgil that horrid old professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow but i simply couldnt settle down to study tonight
anne_shirley methinks i see the traces of tear if you ve been crying do own up it will restore my self respect for i was shedding tear freely before ruby_gillis came along
i dont mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey too cake you ll give me a teeny piece wont you
ruby_gillis perceiving the queen calendar lying on the table wanted to know if anne_shirley meant to try for the gold medal
thank you it has the real avonlea flavor anne_shirley blushed and admitted she was thinking of it oh that reminds me said josie_pye queen is to get one of the avery scholarships after all
the word came today frank stockley told me his uncle is one of the board of governors you know it will be announced in the academy tomorrow
an avery scholarship anne_shirley felt her heart beat more quickly and the horizons of her ambition shifted and broadened as if by magic
before josie_pye had told the news anne_shirley highest pinnacle of aspiration had been a teacher provincial license first class at the end of the year and perhaps the medal
but now in one moment anne_shirley saw herself winning the avery scholarship taking an arts course at redmond college and graduating in a gown and mortar board before the echo of josie_pye word had died away
a wealthy manufacturer of new brunswick had died and left part of his fortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed among the various high school and academies of the maritime provinces according to their respective standings
there had been much doubt whether one would be allotted to queen but the matter was settled at last and at the end of the year the graduate who made the highest mark in english and english literature would win the scholarship two hundred and fifty dollars a year for four year at redmond college
for the avery scholarship was in english and anne_shirley felt that here her foot was on native heath no wonder that anne_shirley went to bed that night with tingling cheeks
i ll win that scholarship if hard work can do it she resolved wouldnt matthew_cuthbert be proud if i got to be a a
oh it delightful to have ambitions i so glad i have such a lot and there never seems to be any end to them that the best of it
just as soon as you attain to one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still it does make life so interesting
chapter xxxv the winter at queen anne_shirley homesickness wore off greatly helped in the wearing by her weekend visits home
as long as the open weather lasted the avonlea students went out to carmody on the new branch railway every friday night
diana_barry and several other avonlea young folks were generally on hand to meet them and they all walked over to avonlea in a merry party
anne_shirley thought those friday evening gypsyings over the autumnal hill in the crisp golden air with the homelights of avonlea twinkling beyond were the best and dearest hour in the whole week
ruby_gillis was a very handsome young lady now thinking herself quite as grown up as she really was she wore her skirts as long as her mother would let her and did her hair up in town though she had to take it down when she went home
gilbert_blythe nearly always walked with ruby_gillis and carried her satchel for her she had large bright blue eye a brilliant complexion and a plump showy figure
she laughed a great deal was cheerful and good tempered and enjoyed the pleasant thing of life frankly but i shouldnt think she was the sort of girl gilbert_blythe would like whispered jane_andrews to anne_shirley
she could not help thinking too that it would be very pleasant to have such a friend as gilbert_blythe to jest and chatter with and exchange ideas about book and studies and ambitions
gilbert_blythe had ambitions she knew and ruby_gillis did not seem the sort of person with whom such could be profitably discussed
anne_shirley did not think so either but she would not have said so for the avery scholarship there was no silly sentiment in anne_shirley ideas concerning gilbert_blythe
if she and gilbert_blythe had been friend she would not have cared how many other friend he had nor with whom he walked
she had a genius for friendship girl friend she had in plenty but she had a vague consciousness that masculine friendship might also be a good thing to round out one conceptions of companionship and furnish broader standpoints of judgment and comparison
boy were to her when she thought about them at all merely possible good comrades not that anne_shirley could have put her feeling on the matter into just such clear definition
but she thought that if gilbert_blythe had ever walked home with her from the train over the crisp field and along the ferny byways they might have had many and merry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening around them and their hopes and ambitions therein
gilbert_blythe was a clever young fellow with his own thoughts about thing and a determination to get the best out of life and put the best into it
ruby_gillis told jane_andrews that she didnt understand half the thing gilbert_blythe said he talked just like anne_shirley did when she had a thoughtful fit on and for her part
she didnt think it any fun to be bothering about book and that sort of thing when you didnt have to
frank stockley had lot more dash and go but then he wasnt half as good looking as gilbert_blythe and she really couldnt decide which she liked best
with the rose red girl stella maynard and the dream girl priscilla grant she soon became intimate finding the latter pale spiritual looking maiden to be full to the brim of mischief and pranks and fun while the vivid black eyed stella had a heartful of wistful dream and fancies as aerial and rainbow like as anne_shirley own
in the academy anne_shirley gradually drew a little circle of friend about her thoughtful imaginative ambitious students like herself after the christmas holidays the avonlea students gave up going home on fridays and settled down to hard work
by this time all the queen scholars had gravitated into their own place in the ranks and the various class had assumed distinct and settled shadings of individuality
it was admitted that the medal contestants had practically narrowed down to three gilbert_blythe anne_shirley and lewis wilson the avery scholarship was more doubtful any one of a certain six being a possible winner
the bronze medal for mathematics was considered as good as won by a fat funny little up country boy with a bumpy forehead and a patched coat
ruby_gillis was the handsomest girl of the year at the academy in the second year class stella maynard carried off the palm for beauty with small but critical minority in favor of anne_shirley
ethel marr was admitted by all competent judges to have the most stylish modes of hair dressing and jane_andrews plain plodding conscientious jane_andrews carried off the honors in the domestic science course
certain facts had become generally accepted even josie_pye attained a certain preeminence as the sharpest tongued young lady in attendance at queen
so it may be fairly stated that miss_stacy old pupils held their own in the wider arena of the academical course
her rivalry with gilbert_blythe was as intense as it had ever been in avonlea school although it was not known in the class at large but somehow the bitterness had gone out of it
anne_shirley no longer wished to win for the sake of defeating gilbert_blythe rather for the proud consciousness of a well won victory over a worthy foeman
anne_shirley worked hard and steadily it would be worth while to win but she no longer thought life would be insupportable if she did not
anne_shirley spent many of her spare hour at beechwood and generally ate her sunday dinner there and went to church with miss diana_barry
the latter was as she admitted growing old but her black eye were not dim nor the vigor of her tongue in the least abated
in spite of lesson the students found opportunities for pleasant time but she never sharpened the latter on anne_shirley who continued to be a prime favorite with the critical old lady
that anne_shirley girl improves all the time she said i get tired of other girl there is such a provoking and eternal sameness about them
i dont know that she is as amusing as she was when she was a child but she makes me love her
anne_shirley has as many shades as a rainbow and every shade is the prettiest while it lasts and i like people who make me love them
then almost before anybody realized it spring had come out in avonlea the mayflowers were peeping pinkly out on the sere barrens where snow wreaths lingered and the mist of green was on the wood and in the valleys
it saves me so much trouble in making myself love them but in charlottetown harassed queen students thought and talked only of examinations
it doesnt seem possible that the term is nearly over said anne_shirley why last fall it seemed so long to look forward to a whole winter of studies and class
girl sometimes i feel as if those exams meant everything but when i look at the big buds swelling on those chestnut tree and the misty blue air at the end of the streets they dont seem half so important
and here we are with the exams looming up next week jane_andrews and ruby_gillis and josie_pye who had dropped in did not take this view of it
it was all very well for anne_shirley who was sure of passing at least to have her moment of belittling them but when your whole future depended on them as the girl truly thought theirs did you could not regard them philosophically
to them the coming examinations were constantly very important indeed far more important than chestnut buds or maytime hazes i ve lost seven pounds in the last two week sighed jane_andrews
it no use to say dont worry i will worry worrying helps you some it seems as if you were doing something when you re worrying
it would be dreadful if i failed to get my license after going to queen all winter and spending so much money
i dont care said josie_pye if i dont pass this year i coming back next my father can afford to send me
anne_shirley frank stockley says that professor tremaine said gilbert_blythe was sure to get the medal and that emily clay would likely win the avery scholarship
that may make me feel badly tomorrow josie_pye laughed anne_shirley but just now i honestly feel that as long as i know the violets are coming out all purple down in the hollow below green gables and that little ferns are poking their head up in lovers lane it not a great deal of difference whether i win the avery or not
i ve done my best and i begin to understand what is meant by the joy of the strife next to trying and winning the best thing is trying and failing
look at that arch of pale green sky over those house and picture to yourself what it must look like over the purply dark beech wood back of avonlea
girl dont talk about exams what are you going to wear for commencement jane_andrews asked ruby_gillis practically jane_andrews and josie_pye both answered at once and the chatter drifted into a side eddy of fashions
but anne_shirley with her elbows on the window sill her soft cheek laid against her clasped hand and her eye filled with visions looked out unheedingly across city roof and spire to that glorious dome of sunset sky and wove her dream of a possible future from the golden tissue of youth own optimism
all the beyond was hers with its possibilities lurking rosily in the oncoming year each year a rose of promise to be woven into an immortal chaplet
the glory and the dream on the morning when the final results of all the examinations were to be posted on the bulletin board at queen anne_shirley and jane_andrews walked down the street together
chapter xxxvi jane_andrews was smiling and happy examinations were over and she was comfortably sure she had made a pass at least
further considerations troubled jane_andrews not at all she had no soaring ambitions and consequently was not affected with the unrest attendant thereon
for we pay a price for everything we get or take in this world and although ambitions are well worth having they are not to be cheaply won but exact their dues of work and self denial anxiety and discouragement
anne_shirley was pale and quiet in ten more minute she would know who had won the medal and who the avery
of course you ll win one of them anyhow said jane_andrews who couldnt understand how the faculty could be so unfair as to order it otherwise
beyond those ten minute there did not seem just then to be anything worth being called time i have not hope of the avery said anne_shirley
everybody says emily clay will win it and i not going to march up to that bulletin board and look at it before everybody
i havent the moral courage i going straight to the girl dressing room you must read the announcements and then come and tell me jane_andrews
if i have failed just say so without trying to break it gently and whatever you do dont sympathize with me
and i implore you in the name of our old friendship to do it as quickly as possible promise me this jane_andrews
when they went up the entrance steps of queen they found the hall full of boy who were carrying gilbert_blythe around on their shoulders and yelling at the tops of their voice hurrah for gilbert_blythe medalist
jane_andrews promised solemnly but as it happened there was no necessity for such a promise for a moment anne_shirley felt one sickening pang of defeat and disappointment
so she had failed and gilbert_blythe had won well matthew_cuthbert would be sorry he had been so sure she would win
and then somebody called out three cheers for miss anne_shirley winner of the avery oh anne_shirley gasped jane_andrews as they fled to the girl dressing room amid hearty cheers
oh anne_shirley i so proud isnt it splendid and then the girl were around them and anne_shirley was the center of a laughing congratulating group
she was pushed and pulled and hugged and among it all she managed to whisper to jane_andrews oh wont matthew_cuthbert and miss_marilla_cuthbert be pleased
her shoulders were thumped and her hand shaken vigorously i must write the news home right away commencement was the next important happening
the exercises were held in the big assembly hall of the academy addresses were given essays read songs sung the public award of diplomas prizes and medals made
matthew_cuthbert and miss_marilla_cuthbert were there with eye and ears for only one student on the platform a tall girl in pale green with faintly flushed cheeks and starry eye who read the best essay and was pointed out and whispered about as the avery winner
reckon you re glad we kept her miss_marilla_cuthbert whispered matthew_cuthbert speaking for the first time since he had entered the hall when anne_shirley had finished her essay
it not the first time i ve been glad retorted miss_marilla_cuthbert you do like to rub thing in matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert
miss diana_barry who was sitting behind them leaned forward and poked miss_marilla_cuthbert in the back with her parasol arent you proud of that anne_shirley girl
i am she said anne_shirley went home to avonlea with matthew_cuthbert and miss_marilla_cuthbert that evening she had not been home since april and she felt that she could not wait another day
in her own white room where miss_marilla_cuthbert had set a flowering house rose on the window sill anne_shirley looked about her and drew a long breath of happiness
the apple blossoms were out and the world was fresh and young diana_barry was at green gables to meet her
it so good to see those pointed firs coming out against the pink sky and that white orchard and the old snow queen
oh diana_barry it so good to be back again isnt the breath of the mint delicious and that tea rose why it a song and a hope and a prayer all in one
and it good to see you again diana_barry i thought you liked that stella maynard better than me said diana_barry reproachfully
josie_pye told me you did josie_pye said you were infatuated with her anne_shirley laughed and pelted diana_barry with the faded june lilies of her bouquet
stella maynard is the dearest girl in the world except one and you are that one diana_barry she said
i love you more than ever and i ve so many thing to tell you but just now i feel as if it were joy enough to sit here and look at you
i tired i think tired of being studious and ambitious i mean to spend at least two hour tomorrow lying out in the orchard grass thinking of absolutely nothing
you ve done splendidly anne_shirley i suppose you wont be teaching now that you ve won the avery no i going to redmond in september
doesnt it seem wonderful i ll have a brand new stock of ambition laid in by that time after three glorious golden months of vacation
jane_andrews and ruby_gillis are going to teach isnt it splendid to think we all got through even to moody_spurgeon_macpherson and josie_pye
the newbridge trustees have offered jane_andrews their school already said diana_barry gilbert_blythe is going to teach too he has to
his father cant afford to send him to college next year after all so he means to earn his own way through
i expect he ll get the school here if miss ames decides to leave anne_shirley felt a queer little sensation of dismayed surprise
she had not known this she had expected that gilbert_blythe would be going to redmond also what would she do without their inspiring rivalry
would not work even at a coeducational college with a real degree in prospect be rather flat without her friend the enemy
the next morning at breakfast it suddenly struck anne_shirley that matthew_cuthbert was not looking well surely he was much grayer than he had been a year before
miss_marilla_cuthbert she said hesitatingly when he had gone out is matthew_cuthbert quite well no he isnt said miss_marilla_cuthbert in a troubled tone
he had some real bad spells with his heart this spring and he wont spare himself a mite i ve been real worried about him but he some better
this while back and we ve got a good hired man so i hoping he ll kind of rest and pick up maybe he will now you re home
you always cheer him up anne_shirley leaned across the table and took miss_marilla_cuthbert face in her hand you are not looking as well yourself as i like to see you miss_marilla_cuthbert
i just going to take this one day off to visit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dream and then it will be your turn to be lazy while i do the work
you look tired i afraid you ve been working too hard you must take a rest now that i home miss_marilla_cuthbert smiled affectionately at her girl
it not the work it my head i ve got a pain so often now behind my eye doctor mrs_alexander_spencer been fussing with glasses but they dont do me any good
there is a distinguished oculist coming to the island the last of june and the doctor says i must see him
i guess i ll have to i cant read or sew with any comfort now well anne_shirley you ve done real well at queen i must say
to take first class license in one year and win the avery scholarship well well mrs_rachel_lynde says pride goes before a fall and she doesnt believe in the higher education of woman at all she says it unfits them for woman true sphere
i dont believe a word of it speaking of mrs_rachel_lynde reminds me did you hear anything about the abbey bank lately anne_shirley
i heard it was shaky answered anne_shirley why that is what mrs_rachel_lynde said she was up here one day last week and said there was some talk about it
i wanted matthew_cuthbert to put it in the savings bank in the first place but old mr abbey was a great friend of father and he always banked with him
matthew_cuthbert felt real worried all we have saved is in that bank every penny matthew_cuthbert said any bank with him at the head of it was good enough for anybody
i think he has only been its nominal head for many year said anne_shirley he is a very old man his nephews are really at the head of the institution
well when mrs_rachel_lynde told us that i wanted matthew_cuthbert to draw our money right out and he said he think of it
but mr russell told him yesterday that the bank was all right anne_shirley had her good day in the companionship of the outdoor world
she never forgot that day it was so bright and golden and fair so free from shadow and so lavish of blossom
anne_shirley spent some of its rich hour in the orchard she went to the dryad bubble and willowmere and violet vale she called at the manse and had a satisfying talk with mrs_allan and finally in the evening she went with matthew_cuthbert for the cows through lovers lane to the back pasture
the wood were all gloried through with sunset and the warm splendor of it streamed down through the hill gaps in the west
matthew_cuthbert walked slowly with bent head anne_shirley tall and erect suited her springing step to his you ve been working too hard today matthew_cuthbert she said reproachfully
why wont you take thing easier well now i cant seem to said matthew_cuthbert as he opened the yard gate to let the cows through
it only that i getting old anne_shirley and keep forgetting it well well i ve always worked pretty hard and i rather drop in harness
if i had been the boy you sent for said anne_shirley wistfully i be able to help you so much now and spare you in a hundred way
i could find it in my heart to wish i had been just for that well now i rather have you than a dozen boy anne_shirley said matthew_cuthbert patting her hand
just mind you that rather than a dozen boy well now i guess it wasnt a boy that took the avery scholarship was it
it was a girl my girl my girl that i proud of he smiled his shy smile at her as he went into the yard
anne_shirley took the memory of it with her when she went to her room that night and sat for a long while at her open window thinking of the past and dreaming of the future
outside the snow queen was mistily white in the moonshine the frogs were singing in the marsh beyond orchard slope anne_shirley always remembered the silvery peaceful beauty and fragrant calm of that night
it was the last night before sorrow touched her life and no life is ever quite the same again when once that cold sanctifying touch has been laid upon it
chapter xxxvii the reaper whose name is death matthew_cuthbert matthew_cuthbert what is the matter matthew_cuthbert are you sick it was miss_marilla_cuthbert who spoke alarm in every jerky word
anne_shirley came through the hall her hand full of white narcissus it was long before anne_shirley could love the sight or odor of white narcissus
again in time to hear her and to see matthew_cuthbert standing in the porch doorway a folded paper in his hand and his face strangely drawn and gray
anne_shirley dropped her flower and sprang across the kitchen to him at the same moment as miss_marilla_cuthbert they were both too late before they could reach him matthew_cuthbert had fallen across the threshold
martin the hired man who had just driven home from the post office started at once for the doctor calling at orchard slope on his way to send mr and mrs diana_barry over
he fainted gasped miss_marilla_cuthbert anne_shirley run for martin quick quick he at the barn mrs_rachel_lynde who was there on an errand came too
they found anne_shirley and miss_marilla_cuthbert distractedly trying to restore matthew_cuthbert to consciousness mrs_rachel_lynde pushed them gently aside tried his pulse and then laid her ear over his heart
she looked at their anxious face sorrowfully and the tear came into her eye oh miss_marilla_cuthbert she said gravely
i dont think we can do anything for him mrs_rachel_lynde you dont think you cant think matthew_cuthbert is is anne_shirley could not say the dreadful word she turned sick and pallid
child yes i afraid of it look at his face when you ve seen that look as often as i have you ll know what it means
when the doctor came he said that death had been instantaneous and probably painless caused in all likelihood by some sudden shock
the secret of the shock was discovered to be in the paper matthew_cuthbert had held and which martin had brought from the office that morning
anne_shirley looked at the still face and there beheld the seal of the great presence it contained an account of the failure of the abbey bank
the news spread quickly through avonlea and all day friend and neighbors thronged green gables and came and went on errands of kindness for the dead and living
for the first time shy quiet matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert was a person of central importance the white majesty of death had fallen on him and set him apart as one crowned
in the parlor lay matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert in his coffin his long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little kindly smile as if he but slept dreaming pleasant dream
there were flower about him sweet old fashioned flower which his mother had planted in the homestead garden in her bridal day and for which matthew_cuthbert had always had a secret wordless love
when the calm night came softly down over green gables the old house was hushed and tranquil anne_shirley had gathered them and brought them to him her anguished tearless eye burning in her white face
diana_barry going to the east gable where anne_shirley was standing at her window said gently anne_shirley dear would you like to have me sleep with you tonight
it was the last thing she could do for him the barrys and mrs_rachel_lynde stayed with them that night thank you diana_barry
anne_shirley looked earnestly into her friend face i think you wont misunderstand me when i say i want to be alone
i not afraid i havent been alone one minute since it happened and i want to be i want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it
half the time it seems to me that matthew_cuthbert cant be dead and the other half it seems as if he must have been dead for a long time and i ve had this horrible dull ache ever since
miss_marilla_cuthbert impassioned grief breaking all the bounds of natural reserve and lifelong habit in its stormy rush she could comprehend better than anne_shirley tearless agony
i cant realize it diana_barry did not quite understand but she went away kindly leaving anne_shirley alone to keep her first vigil with sorrow
it seemed to her a terrible thing that she could not shed a tear for matthew_cuthbert whom she had loved so much and who had been so kind to her matthew_cuthbert who had walked with her last evening at sunset and was now lying in the dim room below with that awful peace on his brow
but no tear came at first even when she knelt by her window in the darkness and prayed looking up to the stars beyond the hill no tear only the same horrible dull ache of misery that kept on aching until she fell asleep worn out with the day pain and excitement
in the night she awakened with the stillness and the darkness about her and the recollection of the day came over her like a wave of sorrow
she could see matthew_cuthbert face smiling at her as he had smiled when they parted at the gate that last evening she could hear his voice saying
anne_shirley hoped that the tear would come in solitude my girl my girl that i proud of then the tear came and anne_shirley wept her heart out
miss_marilla_cuthbert heard her and crept in to comfort her there there dont cry so dearie it cant bring him back it it isnt right to cry so
i knew that today but i couldnt help it then he always been such a good kind brother to me but god knows best
oh just let me cry miss_marilla_cuthbert sobbed anne_shirley the tear dont hurt me like that ache did stay here for a little while with me and keep your arm round me so
i couldnt have diana_barry stay she good and kind and sweet but it not her sorrow she outside of it and she couldnt come close enough to my heart to help me
it our sorrow yours and mine oh miss_marilla_cuthbert what will we do without him we ve got each other anne_shirley i dont know what i do if you werent here if you never come
oh anne_shirley i know i ve been kind of strict and harsh with you maybe but you mustnt think i didnt love you as well as matthew_cuthbert did for all that
i want to tell you now when i can it never been easy for me to say thing out of my heart but at time like this
i love you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood and you ve been my joy and comfort ever since you came to green gables
two day afterwards they carried matthew_cuthbert miss_marilla_cuthbert over his homestead threshold and away from the field he had tilled and the orchards he had loved and the tree he had planted and then avonlea settled back to its usual placidity and even at green gables affairs slipped into their old groove and work was done and
it easier duties fulfilled with regularity as before although always with the aching sense of loss in all familiar thing
anne_shirley new to grief thought it almost sad that it could be so that they could go on in the old way without matthew_cuthbert
she felt something like shame and remorse when she discovered that the sunrises behind the firs and the pale pink buds opening in the garden gave her the old inrush of gladness when she saw them that diana_barry visits were pleasant to her and that diana_barry merry word and way moved her to laughter and smiles that in brief the beautiful world of blossom and love and friendship had lost none of its power to please her fancy and thrill her heart that life still called to her with many insistent voice
it seems like disloyalty to matthew_cuthbert somehow to find pleasure in these thing now that he has gone she said wistfully to mrs_allan one evening when they were together in the manse garden
i miss him so much all the time and yet mrs_allan the world and life seem very beautiful and interesting to me for all
today diana_barry said something funny and i found myself laughing i thought when it happened i could never laugh again
and it somehow seems as if i oughtnt to when matthew_cuthbert was here he liked to hear you laugh and he liked to know that you found pleasure in the pleasant thing around you said mrs_allan gently
he is just away now and he likes to know it just the same i am sure we should not shut our heart against the healing influences that nature offers us
we resent the thought that anything can please us when someone we love is no longer here to share the pleasure with us and we almost feel as if we were unfaithful to our sorrow when we find our interest in life returning to us
but i can understand your feeling i think we all experience the same thing i was down to the graveyard to plant a rosebush on matthew_cuthbert grave this afternoon said anne_shirley dreamily
i took a slip of the little white scotch rosebush his mother brought out from scotland long ago matthew_cuthbert always liked those roses the best they were so small and sweet on their thorny stems
it made me feel glad that i could plant it by his grave as if i were doing something that must please him in taking it there to be near him
perhaps the souls of all those little white roses that he has loved so many summer were all there to meet him
i hope he has roses like them in heaven i must go home now miss_marilla_cuthbert is all alone and she gets lonely at twilight
she will be lonelier still i fear when you go away again to college said mrs_allan anne_shirley did not reply she said good night and went slowly back to green gables
the door was open behind them held back by a big pink conch shell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions
miss_marilla_cuthbert was sitting on the front door steps and anne_shirley sat down beside her anne_shirley gathered some sprays of pale yellow honeysuckle and put them in her hair
she liked the delicious hint of fragrance as some aerial benediction above her every time she moved doctor mrs_alexander_spencer was here while you were away miss_marilla_cuthbert said
he says that the specialist will be in town tomorrow and he insists that i must go in and have my eye examined
i suppose i better go and have it over i ll be more than thankful if the man can give me the right kind of glasses to suit my eye
you wont mind staying here alone while i away will you martin will have to drive me in and there ironing and baking to do
i shall attend to the ironing and baking beautifully you neednt fear that i ll starch the handkerchiefs or flavor the cake with liniment
i shall be all right diana_barry will come over for company for me miss_marilla_cuthbert laughed what a girl you were for making mistake in them day anne_shirley
you were always getting into scrapes i did use to think you were possessed do you mind the time you dyed your hair
yes indeed i shall never forget it smiled anne_shirley touching the heavy braid of hair that was wound about her shapely head
i laugh a little now sometimes when i think what a worry my hair used to be to me but i dont laugh much because it was a very real trouble then
my freckles are really gone and people are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn now all but josie_pye
she informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder than ever or at least my black dress made it look redder and she asked me if people who had red hair ever got used to having it
i did suffer terribly over my hair and my freckles miss_marilla_cuthbert i ve almost decided to give up trying to like josie_pye
i ve made what i would once have called a heroic effort to like her but josie_pye wont be liked
i suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in society but i must say i dont know what it is any more than i know the use of thistles
josie_pye is a josie_pye said miss_marilla_cuthbert sharply so she cant help being disagreeable is josie_pye going to teach no she is going back to queen next year
so are moody_spurgeon_macpherson and charlie_sloane jane_andrews and ruby_gillis are going to teach and they have both got school jane_andrews at newbridge and ruby_gillis at some place up west
gilbert_blythe is going to teach too isnt he yes briefly what a nice looking fellow he is said miss_marilla_cuthbert absently
i saw him in church last sunday and he seemed so tall and manly he look a lot like his father did at the same age
john gilbert_blythe was a nice boy we used to be real good friend he and i people called him my beau
anne_shirley looked up with swift interest oh miss_marilla_cuthbert and what happened why didnt you we had a quarrel i wouldnt forgive him when he asked me to
i meant to after awhile but i was sulky and angry and i wanted to punish him first he never came back the blythes were all mighty independent
but i always felt rather sorry i ve always kind of wished i forgiven him when i had the chance so you ve had a bit of romance in your life too said anne_shirley softly
yes i suppose you might call it that you wouldnt think so to look at me would you but you never can tell about people from their outsides
everybody has forgot about me and john i forgotten myself but it all came back to me when i saw gilbert_blythe last sunday
anne_shirley had gone over to orchard slope with diana_barry and came back to find miss_marilla_cuthbert in the kitchen sitting by the table with her head leaning on her hand
chapter xxxviii the bend in the road miss_marilla_cuthbert went to town the next day and returned in the evening something in her dejected attitude struck a chill to anne_shirley heart
she had never seen miss_marilla_cuthbert sit limply inert like that are you very tired miss_marilla_cuthbert yes no i dont know said miss_marilla_cuthbert wearily looking up
i suppose i am tired but i havent thought about it it not that did you see the oculist what did he say
he says that if i give up all reading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eye and if i careful not to cry and if i wear the glasses he given me
asked anne_shirley anxiously yes i saw him he examined my eye he thinks my eye may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured
but if i dont he says i ll certainly be stone blind in six months blind anne_shirley just think of it for a minute anne_shirley after her first quick exclamation of dismay was silent
it seemed to her that she could not speak then she said bravely but with a catch in her voice miss_marilla_cuthbert dont think of it
if you are careful you wont lose your sight altogether and if his glasses cure your headaches it will be a great thing
you know he has given you hope i dont call it much hope said miss_marilla_cuthbert bitterly what am i to live for if i cant read or sew or do anything like that
i might as well be blind or dead and as for crying i cant help that when i get lonesome but there it no good talking about it
if you ll get me a cup of tea i ll be thankful i about done out dont say anything about this to any one for a spell yet anyway
i cant bear that folks should come here to question and sympathize and talk about it when miss_marilla_cuthbert had eaten her lunch anne_shirley persuaded her to go to bed
then anne_shirley went herself to the east gable and sat down by her window in the darkness alone with her tear and her heaviness of heart
how sadly thing had changed since she had sat there the night after coming home then she had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy with promise
anne_shirley felt as if she had lived year since then but before she went to bed there was a smile on her lips and peace in her heart
she had looked her duty courageously in the face and found it a friend as duty ever is when we meet it frankly
one afternoon a few day later miss_marilla_cuthbert came slowly in from the front yard where she had been talking to a caller a man whom anne_shirley knew by sight as sadler from carmody
anne_shirley wondered what he could have been saying to bring that look to miss_marilla_cuthbert face what did mr sadler want miss_marilla_cuthbert
miss_marilla_cuthbert sat down by the window and looked at anne_shirley there were tear in her eye in defiance of the oculist prohibition and her voice
broke as she said he heard that i was going to sell green gables and he wants to buy it buy it
buy green gables anne_shirley wondered if she had heard aright oh miss_marilla_cuthbert you dont mean to sell green gables anne_shirley i dont know what else is to be done
if my eye were strong i could stay here and make out to look after thing and manage with a good hired man
i ve thought it all over but as it is i cant i may lose my sight altogether and anyway i ll not be fit to run thing
oh i never thought i live to see the day when i have to sell my home but thing would only go behind worse and worse all the time till nobody would want to buy it
every cent of our money went in that bank and there some notes matthew_cuthbert gave last fall to pay mrs_rachel_lynde advises me to sell the farm and board somewhere with her i suppose
it wont bring much it small and the buildings are old but it ll be enough for me to live on i reckon
i thankful you re provided for with that scholarship anne_shirley i sorry you wont have a home to come to in your vacations
that all but i suppose you ll manage somehow miss_marilla_cuthbert broke down and wept bitterly you mustnt sell green gables said anne_shirley resolutely
oh anne_shirley i wish i didnt have to but you can see for yourself i cant stay here alone i go crazy with trouble and loneliness
and my sight would go i know it would you wont have to stay here alone miss_marilla_cuthbert i ll be with you
i not going to redmond not going to redmond miss_marilla_cuthbert lifted her worn face from her hand and looked at anne_shirley
why what do you mean just what i say i not going to take the scholarship i decided so the night after you came home from town
you surely dont think i could leave you alone in your trouble miss_marilla_cuthbert after all you ve done for me i ve been thinking and planning
let me tell you my plans mr diana_barry wants to rent the farm for next year so you wont have any bother over that
i ve applied for the school here but i dont expect to get it for i understand the trustees have promised it to gilbert_blythe
and i going to teach but i can have the carmody school mr blair told me so last night at the store
of course that wont be quite as nice or convenient as if i had the avonlea school but i can board home and drive myself over to carmody and back in the warm weather at least
and even in winter i can come home fridays we ll keep a horse for that oh i have it all planned out miss_marilla_cuthbert
and i ll read to you and keep you cheered up you sha nt be dull or lonesome and we ll be real cozy and happy here together you and i
miss_marilla_cuthbert had listened like a woman in a dream oh anne_shirley i could get on real well if you were here i know
but i cant let you sacrifice yourself so for me it would be terrible nonsense anne_shirley laughed merrily there is no sacrifice
nothing could be worse than giving up green gables nothing could hurt me more we must keep the dear old place my mind is quite made up miss_marilla_cuthbert
i not going to redmond and i am going to stay here and teach dont you worry about me a bit
but your ambitions and i just as ambitious as ever only i ve changed the object of my ambitions i going to be a good teacher and i going to save your eyesight
besides i mean to study at home here and take a little college course all by myself oh i ve dozens of plans miss_marilla_cuthbert
i ve been thinking them out for a week i shall give life here my best and i believe it will give its best to me in return
when i left queen my future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road i thought i could see along it for many a milestone
now there is a bend in it i dont know what lies around the bend but i going to believe that the best does
it has a fascination of its own that bend miss_marilla_cuthbert i wonder how the road beyond it goes what there is of green glory and soft checkered light and shadows
what new landscapes what new beauties what curves and hill and valleys further on i dont feel as if i ought to let you give it up said miss_marilla_cuthbert referring to the scholarship
but you cant prevent me i sixteen and a half obstinate as a mule as mrs_rachel_lynde once told me laughed anne_shirley
oh miss_marilla_cuthbert dont you go pitying me i dont like to be pitied and there is no need for it
i heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear green gables nobody could love it as you and i do
so we must keep it you blessed girl said miss_marilla_cuthbert yielding i feel as if you given me new life
i guess i ought to stick out and make you go to college but i know i cant so i aint going to try
when it became noised abroad in avonlea that anne_shirley had given up the idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there was a good deal of discussion over it
i ll make it up to you though anne_shirley most of the good folks not knowing about miss_marilla_cuthbert eye thought she was foolish
mrs_allan did not she told anne_shirley so in approving word that brought tear of pleasure to the girl eye neither did good mrs_rachel_lynde
she came up one evening and found anne_shirley and miss_marilla_cuthbert sitting at the front door in the warm scented summer dusk
they liked to sit there when the twilight came down and the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled the dewy air
mrs_rachel_lynde deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the door behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks with a long breath of mingled weariness and relief
i ve been on my feet all day and two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round
i declare i getting glad to sit down it a great blessing not to be fat miss_marilla_cuthbert i hope you appreciate it
well anne_shirley i hear you ve given up your notion of going to college i was real glad to hear it you ve got as much education now as a woman can be comfortable with
i dont believe in girl going to college with the man and cramming their head full of latin and greek and all that nonsense
but i going to study latin and greek just the same mrs_rachel_lynde said anne_shirley laughing i going to take my arts course right here at green gables and study everything that i would at college
mrs_rachel_lynde lifted her hand in holy horror anne_shirley you ll kill yourself not a bit of it i shall thrive on it
oh i not going to overdo thing as josiah allen wife says i shall be mejum but i ll have lot of spare time in the long winter evening and i ve no vocation for fancy work
i going to teach over at carmody you know i dont know it i guess you re going to teach right here in avonlea
the trustees have decided to give you the school mrs_rachel_lynde cried anne_shirley springing to her feet in her surprise
but as soon as gilbert_blythe heard that you had applied for it he went to them they had a business meeting at the school last night you know and told them that he withdrew his application and suggested that they accept yours
why i thought they had promised it to gilbert_blythe so they did he said he was going to teach at white sands
of course he knew how much you wanted to stay with miss_marilla_cuthbert and i must say i think it was real kind and thoughtful in him
real self sacrificing too for he ll have his board to pay at white sands and everybody knows he got to earn his own way through college
that what so the trustees decided to take you i was tickled to death when mrs_thomas came home and told me
i dont feel that i ought to take it murmured anne_shirley i mean i dont think i ought to let gilbert_blythe make such a sacrifice for for me
i guess you cant prevent him now he signed papers with the white sands trustees so it wouldnt do him any good now if you were to refuse
of course you ll take the school you ll get along all right now that there are no pyes going josie_pye was the last of them and a good thing she was that what
there been some josie_pye or other going to avonlea school for the last twenty year and i guess their mission in life was to keep school teacher reminded that earth isnt their home
bless my heart what does all that winking and blinking at the diana_barry gable mean diana_barry is signaling for me to go over laughed anne_shirley
you know we keep up the old custom excuse me while i run over and see what she wants
anne_shirley ran down the clover slope like a deer and disappeared in the firry shadows of the haunted wood mrs_rachel_lynde looked after her indulgently
there a good deal more of the woman about her in others retorted miss_marilla_cuthbert with a momentary return of her old crispness
there a good deal of the child about her yet in some way but crispness was no longer miss_marilla_cuthbert distinguishing characteristic
anne_shirley went to the little avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh flower on matthew_cuthbert grave and water the scotch rosebush
she lingered there until dusk liking the peace and calm of the little place with its poplars whose rustle was like low friendly speech and its whispering grasses growing at will among the graves
as mrs_rachel_lynde told her mrs_thomas that night miss_marilla_cuthbert has got mellow that what when she finally left it and walked down the long hill that sloped to the lake of shining waters
it was past sunset and all avonlea lay before her in a dreamlike afterlight a haunt of ancient peace there was a freshness in the air as of a wind that had blown over honey sweet field of clover
home lights twinkled out here and there among the homestead tree beyond lay the sea misty and purple with its haunting unceasing murmur
the west was a glory of soft mingled hues and the pond reflected them all in still softer shadings the beauty of it all thrilled anne_shirley heart and she gratefully opened the gates of her soul to it
dear old world she murmured you are very lovely and i am glad to be alive in you halfway down the hill a tall lad came whistling out of a gate before the gilbert_blythe homestead
he lifted his cap courteously but he would have passed on in silence if anne_shirley had not stopped and held out her hand
it was gilbert_blythe and the whistle died on his lips as he recognized anne_shirley gilbert_blythe she said with scarlet cheeks i want to thank you for giving up the school for me
it was very good of you and i want you to know that i appreciate it gilbert_blythe took the offered hand eagerly
it wasnt particularly good of me at all anne_shirley i was pleased to be able to do you some small service
are we going to be friend after this have you really forgiven me my old fault anne_shirley laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand
i forgave you that day by the pond landing although i didnt know it what a stubborn little goose i was
i ve been i may as well make a complete confession i ve been sorry ever since we are going to be the best of friend said gilbert_blythe jubilantly
we were born to be good friend anne_shirley you ve thwarted destiny enough i know we can help each other in many way
you are going to keep up your studies arent you so am i come i going to walk home with you
miss_marilla_cuthbert looked curiously at anne_shirley when the latter entered the kitchen who was that came up the lane with you anne_shirley
i didnt think you and gilbert_blythe were such good friend that you stand for half an hour at the gate talking to him said miss_marilla_cuthbert with a dry smile
gilbert_blythe answered anne_shirley vexed to find herself blushing i met him on diana_barry hill we havent been
we ve been good enemies but we have decided that it will be much more sensible to be good friend in the future
were we really there half an hour it seemed just a few minute but you see we have five year lost conversations to catch up with miss_marilla_cuthbert
anne_shirley sat long at her window that night companioned by a glad content the wind purred softly in the cherry boughs and the mint breaths came up to her
anne_shirley horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after coming home from queen but if the path set before her feet was to be narrow she knew that flower of quiet happiness would bloom along it
the joy of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship were to be hers nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her ideal world of dream
the stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow and diana_barry light gleamed through the old gap and there was always the bend in the road
