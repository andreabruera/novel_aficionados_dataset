the title page of the edition published by cramer in geneva which reads $candide$ or optimism translated from the german of dr $candide$ ou optimisme kænˈdiːd french is french satire first published in by $voltaire$ philosopher of the age of enlightenment
this article is about $voltaire$ satire $candide$ the novella has been widely translated with english versions titled $candide$ or all for the best $candide$ or the optimist and $candide$ optimism
it begins with young #man# $candide$ who is living sheltered life in an edenic paradise and being indoctrinated with leibnizian optimism by his mentor professor $dr_pangloss$
the work describes the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle followed by $candide$ slow and painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the #world#
$voltaire$ concludes with $candide$ if not rejecting leibnizian optimism outright advocating deeply practical precept we must cultivate our garden in lieu of the leibnizian mantra of $dr_pangloss$ all is for the best in the best of all possible #world#
a picaresque novel with story similar to that of more serious coming of age narrative bildungsroman it parodies many adventure and romance clichés the struggles of which are caricatured in tone that is bitter and matter of fact
$candide$ is characterized by its tone as well as by its erratic fantastical and fast moving plot still the events discussed are often based on historical happenings such as the seven #year# #war# and the lisbon earthquake
as philosophers of $voltaire$ #day# contended with the problem of evil so does $candide$ in this short novel albeit more directly and humorously
$voltaire$ ridicules religion theologians governments armies philosophies and philosophers through $candide$ he assaults leibniz and his optimism $candide$ has enjoyed both great success and great scandal
immediately after its secretive publication the #book# was widely banned to the public because it contained religious blasphemy political sedition and intellectual hostility hidden under thin veil of naïveté
however with its sharp wit and insightful portrayal of the human condition the novel has since inspired many later authors and artists to mimic and adapt it
today $candide$ is recognized as $voltaire$ magnum opus and is often listed as #part# of the western canon it is among the most frequently taught works of french literature
a number of historical events inspired $voltaire$ to write $candide$ most notably the publication of leibniz monadology short metaphysical treatise the seven #year# #war# and the lisbon earthquake
both of the latter catastrophes are frequently referred to in $candide$ and are cited by scholars as reasons for its composition
the lisbon earthquake tsunami and resulting fires of all saints #day# had strong influence on theologians of the #day# and on $voltaire$ who was himself disillusioned by them
the earthquake had an especially large effect on the contemporary doctrine of optimism philosophical system which implies that such events should not occur
optimism is founded on the theodicy of gottfried wilhelm leibniz and says all is for the best because god is benevolent deity
the british poet and literary critic $mr_martin$ seymour smith listed $candide$ as #one# of the most influential #book# ever written this concept is often put into the form all is for the best in the best of all possible #world#
french tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possibles philosophers had trouble fitting the horrors of this earthquake into their optimistic #world# view
$voltaire$ actively rejected leibnizian optimism after the natural disaster convinced that if this were the best possible #world# it should surely be better than it is
this copper engraving shows the ruins of lisbon in flames and tsunami overwhelming the #ship# in the harbour in both $candide$ and poème sur le désastre de lisbonne
he makes use of the lisbon earthquake in both $candide$ and his poème to argue this point sarcastically describing the catastrophe as #one# of the most horrible disasters in the best of all possible #world#
poem on the lisbon disaster $voltaire$ attacks this optimist belief immediately after the earthquake unreliable rumours circulated around europe sometimes overestimating the severity of the event
ira wade noted expert on $voltaire$ and $candide$ has analyzed which sources $voltaire$ might have referenced in learning of the event
wade speculates that $voltaire$ primary source for information on the lisbon earthquake was the work relation historique du tremblement de terre survenu lisbonne by ange goudar
apart from such events contemporaneous stereotypes of the german personality may have been source of inspiration for the text as they were for simplicius simplicissimus satirical picaresque novel written by hans jakob christoffel von grimmelshausen and inspired by the thirty #year# #war#
the protagonist of this novel who was supposed to embody stereotypically german characteristics is quite similar to the protagonist of $candide$
these stereotypes according to $voltaire$ biographer alfred owen aldridge include extreme credulousness or sentimental simplicity two of $candide$ and simplicius defining qualities
aldridge writes since $voltaire$ admitted familiarity with fifteenth century german authors who used bold and buffoonish style it is quite possible that he knew simplicissimus as well
this satire tells the story of a gullible ingenue gulliver who like $candide$ travels to several remote nations and is hardened by the many misfortunes which befall him
a satirical and parodic precursor of $candide$ jonathan swift gulliver travels is #one# of $candide$ closest literary relatives as evidenced by similarities between the two #book# $voltaire$ probably drew upon gulliver travels for inspiration while writing $candide$
$candide$ parody of the bildungsroman is probably based on télémaque which includes the prototypical parody of the tutor on whom $dr_pangloss$ may have been partly based
#other# probable sources of inspiration for $candide$ are télémaque by françois fénelon and cosmopolite by louis charles fougeret de monbron likewise monbron protagonist undergoes disillusioning series of travels similar to those of $candide$
born françois marie arouet $voltaire$ by the #time# of the lisbon earthquake was already well established author known for his satirical wit
he had been made member of the académie française in he was deist strong proponent of religious freedom and critic of tyrannical governments
$candide$ became #part# of his large diverse body of philosophical political and artistic works expressing these views more specifically it was model for the eighteenth and early nineteenth century novels called the contes philosophiques
this genre of which $voltaire$ was #one# of the founders included previous works of his such as zadig and micromegas engraving of $voltaire$ published as the frontispiece to an edition of his dictionnaire philosophique
it is unknown exactly when $voltaire$ wrote $candide$ but scholars estimate that it was primarily composed in late and begun as early as
$voltaire$ is believed to have written portion of it while living at les délices near geneva and also while visiting charles théodore the elector palatinate at schwetzingen for three weeks in the summer of
this idea is probably based on misreading of the work la vie intime de $voltaire$ aux délices et ferney by lucien perey real name clara adèle luce herpin and gaston maugras
the evidence indicates strongly that $voltaire$ did not rush or improvise $candide$ but worked on it over significant period of #time# possibly even whole #year#
despite solid evidence for these claims popular legend persists that $voltaire$ wrote $candide$ in three #day# $candide$ is mature and carefully developed not impromptu as the intentionally choppy plot and the aforementioned myth might suggest
there is only #one# extant manuscript of $candide$ that was written before the work publication it was discovered in by wade and since named the la vallière manuscript
it is believed to have been sent chapter by chapter by $voltaire$ to the duke and duchess la vallière in the autumn of
the manuscript was sold to the bibliothèque de arsenal in the late eighteenth century where it remained undiscovered for almost two hundred #year#
the la vallière manuscript the most original and authentic of all surviving copies of $candide$ was probably dictated by $voltaire$ to his secretary jean louis wagnière then edited directly
in addition to this manuscript there is believed to have been another #one# copied by wagnière for the elector charles théodore who hosted $voltaire$ during the summer of
the existence of this copy was first postulated by norman torrey in if it exists it remains undiscovered $voltaire$ published $candide$ simultaneously in five #country# no later than january although the exact date is uncertain
seventeen versions of $candide$ from in the original french are known today and there has been great controversy over which is the earliest
the complicated science of calculating the relative publication dates of all of the versions of $candide$ is described at #length# in wade article the first edition of $candide$ problem of identification
the publication process was extremely secretive probably the most clandestine work of the century because of the #book# obviously illicit and irreverent content
the greatest number of copies of $candide$ were published concurrently in geneva by cramer in amsterdam by marc michel rey in london by jean nourse and in paris by lambert
more versions were published in #other# languages $candide$ was translated once into italian and thrice into english that same #year# illustration of the two monkeys chasing their lovers
$candide$ shoots the monkeys thinking they are attacking the #woman# $candide$ underwent #one# major revision after its initial publication in addition to some minor #one#
in a version of $candide$ was published that included along with several minor changes major addition by $voltaire$ to the twenty second chapter section that had been thought weak by the duke of vallière
the english title of this edition was $candide$ or optimism translated from the german of dr ralph with the additions found in the doctor pocket when he died at minden in the #year# of grace
the last edition of $candide$ authorised by $voltaire$ was the #one# included in cramer edition of his complete works known as édition encadrée in reference to the border or frame around each page
$voltaire$ strongly opposed the inclusion of illustrations in his works as he stated in letter to the writer and publisher charles joseph panckoucke
ces colifichets ont jamais été admis dans les éditions de cicéron de virgile et horace i believe that these illustrations would be quite useless
these baubles have never been allowed in the works of cicero virgil and horace despite this protest two sets of illustrations for $candide$ were produced by the french artist jean michel moreau le jeune
the first version was done at moreau own expense in and included in kehl publication of that #year# oeuvres complètes de $voltaire$
four images were drawn by moreau for this edition and were engraved by pierre charles baquoy the second version in consisted of seven drawings by moreau which were transposed by multiple engravers
the twentieth century modern artist paul klee stated that it was while reading $candide$ that he discovered his own artistic style
klee illustrated the work and his drawings were published in version edited by kurt wolff illegitimate son of the #sister# of the baron of thunder ten tronckh
cunégonde the daughter of the baron of thunder ten tronckh professor $dr_pangloss$ the royal educator of the court of the baron
described as the greatest philosopher of the holy roman empire the old #woman# cunégonde maid while she was the mistress of don issachar and the grand inquisitor of portugal

$candide$ contains thirty episodic chapters which may be grouped into two main schemes #one# consists of two divisions separated by the protagonist hiatus in el dorado the #other# consists of three #part# each defined by its geographical setting
in an inn in venice $candide$ and $mr_martin$ ate with six foreigners who turned out to be deposed monarchs by the former scheme the first half of $candide$ constitutes the rising action and the last #part# the resolution
this view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest reminiscent of adventure and picaresque novels which tend to employ such dramatic structure
by the latter scheme the thirty chapters may be grouped into three #part# each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale
i are set in europe xi xx are set in the americas and xxi xxx are set in europe and the ottoman empire
the tale of $candide$ begins in the #castle# of the baron thunder ten tronckh in westphalia home to the baron daughter #lady# cunégonde his bastard nephew $candide$ tutor $dr_pangloss$ chambermaid $paquette$ and the rest of the baron family
the plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes $voltaire$ additions of the protagonist $candide$ is romantically attracted to cunégonde
he is young #man# of the most unaffected simplicity esprit le plus simple whose face is the true index of his mind sa physionomie annonçait son âme

for this infraction $candide$ is evicted from the #castle# at which point he is captured by bulgar prussian recruiters and coerced into military service where he is flogged nearly executed and forced to participate in major battle between the bulgars and the avars an allegory representing the prussians and the french
$candide$ eventually escapes the army and makes his #way# to holland where he is given aid by jacques an anabaptist who strengthens $candide$ optimism
encouraged by this show of affection cunégonde drops her handkerchief next to $candide$ enticing him to kiss her soon after $candide$ finds his #master# $dr_pangloss$ now beggar with syphilis
$dr_pangloss$ reveals he was infected with this disease by $paquette$ and shocks $candide$ by relating how #castle# thunder ten tronckh was destroyed by bulgars that cunégonde and her whole family were killed and that cunégonde was raped before her death
$dr_pangloss$ is cured of his illness by jacques losing #one# #eye# and #one# ear in the process and the three set sail to lisbon
in lisbon harbor they are overtaken by vicious storm which destroys the boat jacques attempts to save sailor and in the process is thrown overboard
the sailor makes no move to help the drowning jacques and $candide$ is in state of despair until $dr_pangloss$ explains to him that lisbon harbor was created in order for jacques to drown
only $dr_pangloss$ $candide$ and the brutish sailor who let jacques drown survive the wreck and reach lisbon which is promptly hit by an earthquake tsunami and fire that kill tens of thousands
the sailor leaves in order to loot the rubble while $candide$ injured and begging for help is lectured on the optimistic view of the situation by $dr_pangloss$
the next #day# $dr_pangloss$ discusses his optimistic philosophy with member of the portuguese inquisition and he and $candide$ are arrested for heresy set to be tortured and killed in an auto da fé set up to appease god and prevent another disaster
$candide$ is flogged and sees $dr_pangloss$ hanged but another earthquake intervenes and he escapes he is approached by an old #woman# who leads him to #house# where #lady# cunégonde waits alive
$candide$ is surprised $dr_pangloss$ had told him that cunégonde had been raped and disemboweled she had been but cunégonde points out that #people# survive such #thing#
however her rescuer sold her to jewish merchant don issachar who was then threatened by corrupt grand inquisitor into sharing her don issachar gets cunégonde on mondays wednesdays and the sabbath #day#
her owners arrive find her with another #man# and $candide$ kills them both $candide$ and the two #woman# flee the city heading to the americas
the old #woman# reciprocates by revealing her own tragic life born the daughter of pope urban and the princess of palestrina she was raped and enslaved by african pirates witnessed violent civil #war# in morocco under the bloodthirsty #king# moulay ismaïl during which her #mother# was drawn and quartered suffered further slavery and famine nearly died from plague in algiers and had buttock cut off to feed starving janissaries during the russian siege of azov
along the #way# cunégonde falls into self pity complaining of all the misfortunes that have befallen her after traversing all the russian empire she eventually became servant of don issachar and met cunégonde
the trio arrives in buenos aires where governor don fernando ibarra figueroa mascarenes lampourdos souza asks to marry cunégonde just then an alcalde a spanish fortress commander arrives pursuing $candide$ for killing the grand inquisitor
illustration of $candide$ and $cacambo$ meeting maimed slave of the sugar mill near suriname at border post on the #way# to paraguay $cacambo$ and $candide$ speak to the commandant who turns out to be cunégonde unnamed brother
he explains that after his family was slaughtered the jesuits preparation for his burial revived him and he has since joined the order
leaving the #woman# behind $candide$ flees to paraguay with his practical and heretofore unmentioned manservant $cacambo$ when $candide$ proclaims he intends to marry cunégonde her brother attacks him and $candide$ runs him through with his rapier
after lamenting all the #people# mainly priests he has killed he and $cacambo$ flee in their flight $candide$ and $cacambo$ come across two naked #woman# being chased and bitten by pair of monkeys
$candide$ seeking to protect the #woman# shoots and kills the monkeys but is informed by $cacambo$ that the monkeys and #woman# were probably lovers
$cacambo$ and $candide$ are captured by oreillons or orejones members of the inca nobility who widened the lobes of their ears and are depicted here as the fictional inhabitants of the area
mistaking $candide$ for jesuit by his robes the oreillons prepare to cook $candide$ and $cacambo$ however $cacambo$ convinces the oreillons that $candide$ killed jesuit to procure the robe
$cacambo$ and $candide$ are released and travel for month on #foot# and then down river by canoe living on fruits and berries
after few more adventures $candide$ and $cacambo$ wander into el dorado geographically isolated utopia where the streets are covered with precious stones there exist no priests and all of the #king# jokes are funny
$candide$ and $cacambo$ stay month in el dorado but $candide$ is still in pain without cunégonde and expresses to the #king# his wish to leave
the pair continue their journey now accompanied by #one# hundred red pack #sheep# carrying provisions and incredible sums of #money# which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures
$candide$ and $cacambo$ eventually reach suriname where they split up $cacambo$ travels to buenos aires to retrieve #lady# cunégonde while $candide$ prepares to travel to europe to await the two
the #king# points out that this is foolish idea but generously helps them do so $candide$ remaining #sheep# are stolen and $candide$ is fined heavily by dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft
before leaving suriname $candide$ feels in need of companionship so he interviews number of local #man# who have been through various ill fortunes and settles on #man# named $mr_martin$
for the remainder of the voyage $mr_martin$ and $candide$ argue about philosophy $mr_martin$ painting the entire #world# as occupied by fools
this companion $mr_martin$ is manichaean scholar based on the real life pessimist pierre bayle who was chief opponent of leibniz $candide$ however remains an optimist at heart since it is all he knows
after detour to bordeaux and paris they arrive in england and see an admiral based on admiral byng being shot for not killing enough of the enemy
$mr_martin$ explains that britain finds it necessary to shoot an admiral from #time# to #time# pour encouragement des autres to encourage the #other#
$candide$ horrified arranges for them to leave britain immediately upon their arrival in venice $candide$ and $mr_martin$ meet $paquette$ the chambermaid who infected $dr_pangloss$ with his syphilis in venice
although both appear happy on the surface they reveal their despair $paquette$ has led miserable existence as sexual object and the monk detests the religious order in which he was indoctrinated
she is now prostitute and is spending her #time# with theatine monk brother $friar_giroflée$ $candide$ gives two thousand piastres to $paquette$ and #one# thousand to brother $friar_giroflée$
$candide$ and $mr_martin$ visit the lord pococurante noble venetian that evening $cacambo$ now slave arrives and informs $candide$ that cunégonde is in constantinople
these strangers are revealed to be dethroned #king# the ottoman sultan ahmed iii emperor ivan vi of russia charles edward stuart an unsuccessful pretender to the english throne augustus iii of poland stanisław leszczyński and theodore of corsica
prior to their departure $candide$ and $mr_martin$ dine with six strangers who had come for carnival of venice on the #way# to constantinople $cacambo$ reveals that cunégonde now horribly ugly
after arriving at the bosphorus they board galley where to $candide$ surprise he finds $dr_pangloss$ and cunégonde brother among the rowers
currently washes dishes on the banks of the propontis as slave for transylvanian prince by the name of rákóczi $candide$ buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices
the baron and $dr_pangloss$ relate how they survived but despite the horrors he has been through $dr_pangloss$ optimism remains unshaken i still hold to my original opinions because after all i philosopher and it wouldnt be proper for me to recant since leibniz cannot be wrong and since pre established harmony is the most beautiful #thing# in the #world# along with the plenum and subtle matter
$candide$ the baron $dr_pangloss$ $mr_martin$ and $cacambo$ arrive at the banks of the propontis where they rejoin cunégonde and the old #woman#
cunégonde has indeed become hideously ugly but $candide$ nevertheless buys their freedom and marries cunégonde to spite her brother who forbids cunégonde from marrying anyone but baron of the empire he is secretly sold back into slavery
having squandered their three thousand piastres are reconciled with $candide$ on small farm une petite métairie which he just bought with the last of his finances
$paquette$ and brother $friar_giroflée$ #one# #day# the protagonists seek out dervish known as great philosopher of the land $candide$ asks him why #man# is made to suffer so and what they all ought to do
the dervish describes human beings as mice on #ship# sent by #king# to egypt their comfort does not matter to the #king#
the dervish responds by asking rhetorically why $candide$ is concerned about the existence of evil and good the dervish then slams his door on the group
returning to their farm $candide$ $dr_pangloss$ and $mr_martin$ meet turk whose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs
he and his four children cultivate small area of land and the work keeps them free of three great evils boredom vice and poverty
$candide$ $dr_pangloss$ $mr_martin$ cunégonde $paquette$ $cacambo$ the old #woman# and brother $friar_giroflée$ all set to work on this commendable plan louable dessein on their farm each exercising his or her own talents
$candide$ ignores $dr_pangloss$ insistence that all turned out for the best by necessity instead telling him we must cultivate our garden
il faut cultiver notre jardin as $voltaire$ himself described it the purpose of $candide$ was to bring amusement to small number of #man# of wit
the author achieves this goal by combining his sharp wit with fun parody of the classic adventure romance plot $candide$ is confronted with horrible events described in painstaking detail so often that it becomes humorous
literary theorist frances barasch described $voltaire$ matter of fact narrative as treating topics such as mass death as coolly as weather report
the fast paced and improbable plot in which characters narrowly escape death repeatedly for instance allows for compounding tragedies to befall the same characters over and over again
behind the playful façade of $candide$ which has amused so many there lies very harsh criticism of contemporary european civilization which angered many #other#
european governments such as france prussia portugal and england are each attacked ruthlessly by the author the french and prussians for the seven #year# #war# the portuguese for their inquisition and the british for the execution of john byng
in the #end# $candide$ is primarily as described by $voltaire$ biographer ian davidson short light rapid and humorous organised religion too is harshly treated in $candide$
aldridge provides characteristic example of such anti clerical passages for which the work was banned while in paraguay $cacambo$ remarks are masters of everything and the #people# have no #money# at all
for example $voltaire$ mocks the jesuit order of the roman catholic church here $voltaire$ suggests the christian mission in paraguay is taking advantage of the local population
$voltaire$ depicts the jesuits holding the indigenous peoples as slaves while they claim to be helping them the main method of $candide$ satire is to contrast ironically great tragedy and comedy
the story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the #world# it displays real #one# starkly allowing $voltaire$ to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions highlighting their flaws
thus $candide$ derides optimism for instance with deluge of horrible historical or at least plausible events with no apparent redeeming qualities
a simple example of the satire of $candide$ is seen in the treatment of the historic event witnessed by $candide$ and $mr_martin$ in portsmouth harbour
there the duo spy an anonymous admiral supposed to represent john byng being executed for failing to properly engage french fleet
the admiral is blindfolded and shot on the deck of his own #ship# merely to encourage the #other# french pour encourager les autres
this depiction of military punishment trivializes byng death the dry pithy explanation to encourage the #other# thus satirises serious historical event in characteristically voltairian fashion
for its classic wit this phrase has become #one# of the more often quoted from $candide$ $voltaire$ depicts the worst of the #world# and his pathetic hero desperate effort to fit it into an optimistic outlook
there is at least #one# notable exception the episode of el dorado fantastic village in which the inhabitants are simply rational and their society is just and reasonable
almost all of $candide$ is discussion of various forms of evil its characters rarely find even temporary respite the positivity of el dorado may be contrasted with the pessimistic attitude of most of the #book#
even in this case the bliss of el dorado is fleeting $candide$ soon leaves the village to seek cunégonde whom he eventually marries only out of sense of obligation
another element of the satire focuses on what william bottiglia author of many published works on $candide$ calls the sentimental foibles of the age and
$voltaire$ attack on them flaws in european culture are highlighted as $candide$ parodies adventure and romance clichés mimicking the style of picaresque novel
number of archetypal characters thus have recognisable manifestations in $voltaire$ work $candide$ is supposed to be the drifting rogue of low social class cunégonde the sex interest $dr_pangloss$ the knowledgeable mentor and $cacambo$ the skilful valet
as the plot unfolds readers find that $candide$ is no rogue cunégonde becomes ugly and $dr_pangloss$ is stubborn fool the characters of $candide$ are unrealistic two dimensional mechanical and even marionette like they are simplistic and stereotypical
as the initially naïve protagonist eventually comes to mature conclusion however noncommittal the novella is bildungsroman if not very serious #one# gardens are thought by many critics to play critical symbolic role in $candide$
the first location commonly identified as garden is the #castle# of the baron from which $candide$ and cunégonde are evicted much in the same fashion as adam and eve are evicted from the garden of eden in the #book# of genesis
cyclically the main characters of $candide$ conclude the novel in garden of their own making #one# which might represent celestial paradise
the third most prominent garden is el dorado which may be false eden #other# possibly symbolic gardens include the jesuit pavilion the garden of pococurante $cacambo$ garden and the turk garden
these gardens are probably references to the garden of eden but it has also been proposed by bottiglia for example that the gardens refer also to the encyclopédie and that $candide$ conclusion to cultivate his garden symbolises $voltaire$ great support for this endeavour
$candide$ and his companions as they find themselves at the #end# of the novella are in very similar position to $voltaire$ tightly knit philosophical circle which supported the encyclopédie the main characters of $candide$ live in seclusion to cultivate garden just as $voltaire$ suggested his colleagues leave society to write
in addition there is evidence in the epistolary correspondence of $voltaire$ that he had elsewhere used the metaphor of gardening to describe writing the encyclopédie
another interpretative possibility is that $candide$ cultivating his garden suggests his engaging in only necessary occupations such as feeding oneself and fighting boredom
this is analogous to $voltaire$ own view on gardening he was himself gardener at his estates in les délices and ferney and he often wrote in his correspondence that gardening was an important pastime of his own
it being an extraordinarily effective #way# to keep busy $candide$ satirises various philosophical and religious theories that $voltaire$ had previously criticised
primary among these is leibnizian optimism sometimes called panglossianism after its fictional proponent which $voltaire$ ridicules with descriptions of seemingly endless calamity
$voltaire$ demonstrates variety of irredeemable evils in the #world# leading many critics to contend that $voltaire$ treatment of evil specifically the theological problem of its existence is the focus of the work
heavily referenced in the text are the lisbon earthquake disease and the sinking of #ship# in storms also #war# thievery and murder evils of human design are explored as extensively in $candide$ as are environmental ills
bottiglia notes $voltaire$ is comprehensive in his enumeration of the #world# evils he is unrelenting in attacking leibnizian optimism fundamental to $voltaire$ attack is $candide$ tutor $dr_pangloss$ self proclaimed follower of leibniz and teacher of his doctrine
for example $dr_pangloss$ first teachings of the narrative absurdly mix up cause and effect il est démontré disait il que les choses ne peuvent être autrement car tout étant fait pour une fin tout est nécessairement pour la meilleure fin
ridicule of $dr_pangloss$ theories thus ridicules leibniz himself and $dr_pangloss$ reasoning is silly at best remarquez bien que les nez ont été faits pour porter des lunettes aussi avons nous des lunettes
it is demonstrable that #thing# cannot be otherwise than as they are for as all #thing# have been created for some #end# they must necessarily be created for the best #end#
observe for instance the nose is formed for spectacles therefore we wear spectacles following such flawed reasoning even more doggedly than $candide$ $dr_pangloss$ defends optimism
whatever their horrendous fortune $dr_pangloss$ reiterates all is for the best tout est pour le mieux and proceeds to justify the evil event occurrence
a characteristic example of such theodicy is found in $dr_pangloss$ explanation of why it is good that syphilis exists était une chose indispensable dans le meilleur des mondes un ingrédient nécessaire car si colomb avait pas attrapé dans une île de amérique cette maladie
qui empoisonne la source de la génération qui souvent même empêche la génération et qui est évidemment opposé du grand but de la nature nous aurions
it was #thing# unavoidable necessary ingredient in the best of #world# for if columbus had not caught in an island in america this disease which contaminates the source of generation and frequently impedes propagation itself and is evidently opposed to the great #end# of nature we should have had neither chocolate nor cochineal
ni le chocolat ni la cochenille $candide$ the impressionable and incompetent student of $dr_pangloss$ often tries to justify evil fails invokes his mentor and eventually despairs
it is by these failures that $candide$ is painfully cured as $voltaire$ would see it of his optimism this critique of $voltaire$ seems to be directed almost exclusively at leibnizian optimism
$candide$ does not ridicule $voltaire$ contemporary alexander pope later optimist of slightly different convictions $candide$ does not discuss pope optimistic principle that all is right but
leibniz that states this is the best of all possible #world# however subtle the difference between the two $candide$ is unambiguous as to which is its subject
some critics conjecture that $voltaire$ meant to spare pope this ridicule out of respect although $voltaire$ poème may have been written as more direct response to pope theories
this work is similar to $candide$ in subject matter but very different from it in style the poème embodies more serious philosophical argument than $candide$
the conclusion of the novel in which $candide$ finally dismisses his tutor optimism leaves unresolved what philosophy the protagonist is to accept in its stead
this element of $candide$ has been written about voluminously perhaps above all #other# the conclusion is enigmatic and its analysis is contentious
the conclusion of the novel may be thought of not as philosophical alternative to optimism but as prescribed practical outlook though what it prescribes is in dispute
$voltaire$ develops no formal systematic philosophy for the characters to adopt many critics have concluded that #one# minor character or another is portrayed as having the right philosophy
#other# disagree citing $voltaire$ negative descriptions of $mr_martin$ principles and the conclusion of the work in which $mr_martin$ plays little #part#
for instance number believe that $mr_martin$ is treated sympathetically and that his character holds $voltaire$ ideal philosophy pessimism within debates attempting to decipher the conclusion of $candide$ lies another primary $candide$ debate
this #one# concerns the degree to which $voltaire$ was advocating pessimistic philosophy by which $candide$ and his companions give up hope for better #world#
critics argue that the group reclusion on the farm signifies $candide$ and his companions loss of hope for the rest of the human race
this view is to be compared to reading that presents $voltaire$ as advocating melioristic philosophy and precept committing the travellers to improving the #world# through metaphorical gardening
this debate and #other# focuses on the question of whether or not $voltaire$ was prescribing passive retreat from society or active industrious contribution to it
separate from the debate about the text conclusion is the inside outside controversy this argument centers on the matter of whether or not $voltaire$ was actually prescribing anything
roy wolper professor emeritus of english argues in revolutionary paper that $candide$ does not necessarily speak for its author that the work should be viewed as narrative independent of $voltaire$ history and that its message is entirely or mostly inside it
this point of view the inside specifically rejects attempts to find $voltaire$ voice in the many characters of $candide$ and his #other# works
indeed writers have seen $voltaire$ as speaking through at least $candide$ $mr_martin$ and the turk wolper argues that $candide$ should be read with minimum of speculation as to its meaning in $voltaire$ personal life
critics such as lester crocker henry stavan and vivienne mylne find too many similarities between $candide$ point of view and that of $voltaire$ to accept the inside view they support the outside interpretation
they believe that $candide$ final decision is the same as $voltaire$ and see strong connection between the development of the protagonist and his author
some scholars who support the outside view also believe that the isolationist philosophy of the old turk closely mirrors that of $voltaire$
his article ushered in new era of $voltaire$ studies causing many scholars to look at the novel differently #other# see strong parallel between $candide$ gardening at the conclusion and the gardening of the author
martine darmon meyer argues that the inside view fails to see the satirical work in context and that denying that $candide$ is primarily mockery of optimism a matter of historical context is very basic betrayal of the text
de roman $voltaire$ en fait un lequel est le résumé de toutes ses œuvres toute son intelligence était une machine de guerre
et ce qui me le fait chérir est le dégoût que inspirent les voltairiens des gens qui rient sur les grandes choses
and what makes me cherish it is the disgust which has been inspired in me by the voltairians #people# who laugh about the important #thing#
though $voltaire$ did not openly admit to having written the controversial $candide$ until until then he signed with pseudonym monsieur le docteur ralph or doctor ralph his authorship of the work was hardly disputed
immediately after publication the work and its author were denounced by both secular and religious authorities because the #book# openly derides government and church alike
it was because of such polemics that omer louis françois joly de fleury who was advocate general to the parisian parliament when $candide$ was published found #part# of $candide$ to be contrary to religion and morals
$voltaire$ made with this novel résumé of all his works his whole intelligence was #war# machine despite much official indictment soon after its publication $candide$ irreverent prose was being quoted
let us eat jesuit for instance became popular phrase for its reference to humorous passage in $candide$ by the #end# of february the grand council of geneva and the administrators of paris had banned $candide$

there were so many different editions all sizes and kinds some illustrated and some plain that we figured the #book# must be all right
$candide$ is the most widely read of $voltaire$ many works and it is considered #one# of the great achievements of western literature
for #year# we ve been letting that #book# get by then #one# of us happened to read it however $candide$ is not necessarily considered true classic
according to bottiglia the physical size of $candide$ as well as $voltaire$ attitude toward his fiction precludes the achievement of artistic dimension through plenitude autonomous vitality emotional resonance or poetic exaltation
$candide$ then cannot in quantity or quality measure up to the supreme classics bottiglia instead calls it miniature classic though #other# are more forgiving of its size
$candide$ is listed in harold bloom the western canon the #book# and school of the ages it is included in the encyclopædia britannica collection great #book# of the western #world#
$candide$ has influenced modern writers of black humour such as céline joseph heller john barth thomas pynchon kurt vonnegut and terry southern

mark kamrath professor of english describes the strength of the connection between $candide$ and edgar huntly or memoirs of sleep walker an unusually large number of parallels crop up in the two novels particularly in terms of characters and plot

he cites as evidence for example that the french version of brave new #world# was entitled le meilleur des mondes lit
some twentieth century novels that may have been influenced by $candide$ are dystopian science fiction works readers of $candide$ often compare it with certain works of the modern genre the theatre of the absurd
haydn mason $voltaire$ scholar sees in $candide$ few similarities to this brand of literature for instance he notes commonalities of $candide$ and waiting for godot
in both of these works and in similar #manner# friendship provides emotional support for characters when they are confronted with harshness of their existences
$candide$ #world# has many ridiculous and meaningless elements but human beings are not totally deprived of the ability to make sense out of it
however mason qualifies the conte must not be seen as forerunner of the absurd in modern fiction john pilling biographer of beckett does state that $candide$ was an early and powerful influence on beckett thinking
