I should have been burnt , but you may remember it rained exceedingly hard when they were going to roast me ; the storm was so violent that they despaired of lighting the fire , so I was hanged because they could do no better . A surgeon purchased my body , carried me home , and dissected me . He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula . The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon , and knew how to burn people marvellously well , but he was not accustomed to hanging . The cord was wet and did not slip properly , and besides it was badly tied ; in short , I still drew my breath , when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back , and imagining that he had been dissecting the devil he ran away , dying with fear , and fell down the staircase in his flight . One could not have been worse hanged than I was . His wife , hearing the noise , flew from the next room . She saw me stretched out upon the table with my crucial incision . When they came to themselves a little , I heard the wife say to her husband : ` My dear , how could you take it into your head to dissect a heretic ? She was seized with yet greater fear than her husband , fled , and tumbled over him . Do you not know that these people always have the devil in their bodies ? At this proposal I shuddered , and mustering up what little courage I had still remaining I cried out aloud , ` Have mercy on me ! ' I will go and fetch a priest this minute to exorcise him .

The barber found me a place as lackey to a knight of Malta who was going to Venice , but finding that my master had no money to pay me my wages I entered the service of a Venetian merchant , and went with him to Constantinople . One day I took it into my head to step into a mosque , where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters . Her bosom was uncovered , and between her breasts she had a beautiful bouquet of tulips , roses , anemones , ranunculus , hyacinths , and auriculas . She dropped her bouquet ; I picked it up , and presented it to her with a profound reverence . I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry , and They carried me before the cadi , who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys . seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help . I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron . On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles , five Neapolitan priests , and two monks from Corfu , who told us similar adventures happened daily . The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I , and I insisted that it was far more innocent to take up a bouquet and place it again on a woman 's bosom than to be found stark naked with an Ichoglan .
