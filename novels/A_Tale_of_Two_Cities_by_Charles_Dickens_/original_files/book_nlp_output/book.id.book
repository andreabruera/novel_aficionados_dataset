Such ample leisure had the stone faces , now , for listening to the trees and to the fountain , that the few village scarecrows who , in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn , strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase , had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered .

In the stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder was done , two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose , which everybody recognised , and which nobody had seen of old ; and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified , a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute , before they all started away among the moss and leaves , like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there .
