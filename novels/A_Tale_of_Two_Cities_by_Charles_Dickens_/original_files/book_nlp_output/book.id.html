<p/>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way-- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
<p/>There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France.
<p/>In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.
<p/>Recalled to Life I. The Period It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this.
<p/>Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster.
<p/>Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past -LRB-supernaturally deficient in originality-RRB- rapped out theirs.
<p/>Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.
<p/>France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it.
<p/>Under the guidance of her (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) Christian pastors, she (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) hands cut off, his (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) tongue torn out with pincers, and his (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) body burned alive, because he (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards.
<p/>It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history.
<p/>It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) tumbrils of the Revolution.
<p/>But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.
<p/>Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) fellow-tradesman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) character of <div class="bookquote">``the Captain,''  (<font color='red'><b>character</b></font>)</div>gallantly shot him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, <div class="bookquote">``in consequence of the failure of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) ammunition:''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way.
<p/>In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of sixpence.
<p/>All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
<p/>Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand.
<p/>Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the roads that lay before them.
<p/>It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.
<p/>In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. II. The Mail The Dover road lay, as to him (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>), beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter's Hill.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath.
<p/>Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.
<p/>With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints.
<p/>the near leader violently shook his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) head and everything upon it--like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill.
<p/>As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary <div class="bookquote">``Wo-ho! so-ho-then!''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.
<p/>There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none.
<p/>A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do.
<p/>It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.
<p/>Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots.
<p/>Not one of the three could have said, from anything he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) two companions.
<p/>In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers.
<p/>As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in <div class="bookquote">``the Captain's''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards.
<p/>So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) own particular perch behind the mail, beating his (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>), where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.
<p/>The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) could with a clear conscience have taken his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey.
<p/>'' Wo-ho!'' said the coachman. '' So, then! One more pull and you're at the top and be damned to you,
<p/>for I have had trouble enough to get you to it!--Joe!'' <div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>the guard replied. '' What o'clock do you make it, Joe?''
<p/>'' Ten minutes, good, past eleven.'' '' My blood!'' ejaculated the vexed coachman, <div class="bookquote">``and not atop of Shooter's yet! Tst! Yah!
<p/>The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed suit.
<p/>Get on with you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side.
<p/>If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness, he (<font color='blue'><b>coachman</b></font>) would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.
<p/>They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it. The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill.
<p/>The horses stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tst! Joe! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) box. '' What do you say, Tom?
<p/>'' I say a horse at a gallop, Tom,'' returned the guard, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) hold of the door, and mounting nimbly to his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) place.
<p/>'' They both listened. '' I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.'' '' Gentlemen! In the king's name, all of you!
<p/>The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>), and about to follow.
<p/>'' With this hurried adjuration, he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) cocked his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) blunderbuss, and stood on the offensive. He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained in the road below him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>).
<p/>The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) ears and looked back, without contradicting.
<p/>The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed.
<p/>The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation.
<p/>The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.
<p/>They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.
<p/>'' So-ho! '' the guard sang out, as loud as he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) could roar. '' Yo there! Stand! I shall fire! ''
<p/>The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man's voice called from the mist, <div class="bookquote">``Is that the Dover mail?''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you mind what it is! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>the guard retorted. '' What are you?'' '' Is that the Dover mail?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why do you want to know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want a passenger, if it is. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What passenger?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Jarvis Lorry. '' Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) name.
<p/>Keep where you are,'' the guard called to the voice in the mist, <div class="bookquote">``because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in your lifetime.
<p/>The guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) distrustfully. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.
<p/>'' '' What is the matter?'' asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering speech. '' Who wants me? Is it Jerry?
<p/>'' -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``I don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>growled the guard to himself. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)'s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.''-RRB-
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know this messenger, guard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and pulled up the window.
<p/>'' Yes, Mr. Lorry.'' '' What is the matter?'' <div class="bookquote">``A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>T.</b></font>) may come close; there's nothing wrong. '' <div class="bookquote">``I hope there ain't, but I can't make so `Nation sure of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>said the guard, in gruff soliloquy.
<p/>'' Hallo you!'' <div class="bookquote">``Well! And hallo you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Jerry, more hoarsely than before. <div class="bookquote">``Come on at a footpace! d'ye mind me?
<p/>And if you've got holsters to that saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your hand go nigh 'em. For I'm a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead.
<p/>The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist, and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood.
<p/>So now let's look at you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The rider</b></font>)</div>The rider stooped, and, casting up his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) eyes at the guard, handed the passenger a small folded paper.
<p/>The rider's horse was blown, and both horse and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man.
<p/>The watchful guard, with his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) right hand at the stock of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) raised blunderbuss, his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) left at the barrel, and his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) eye on the horseman, answered curtly, <div class="bookquote">``Sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the horseman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Guard!''  (<font color='red'><b>the passenger</b></font>)</div>said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence. '' There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson's Bank.
<p/>You must know Tellson's Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown to drink. I may read this?''
<p/>'' If so be as you're quick, sir. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and read--first to himself and then aloud:
<p/>''`Wait at Dover for Mam`selle.' It's not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED TO LIFE. ''
<p/>Jerry started in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) saddle. '' That's a Blazing strange answer, too,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>), at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) hoarsest. '' Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as well as if I wrote.
<p/>With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at all assisted by his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general pretence of being asleep.
<p/>Make the best of your way. Good night. '' With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action.
<p/>The guard soon replaced his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) blunderbuss in his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) wore in his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) belt, looked to a smaller chest beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) seat, in which there were a few smith's tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box.
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had only to shut himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and get a light with tolerable safety and ease -LRB-if he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) were lucky-RRB- in five minutes.
<p/>The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent. '' Tom!'' softly over the coach roof.
<p/>'' Hallo, Joe. '' <div class="bookquote">``Did you hear the message?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did, Joe.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What did you make of it, Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe</b></font>)</div>'' Nothing at all, Joe.''
<p/>Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not only to ease his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) face, and shake the wet out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) hat-brim, which might be capable of holding about half a gallon.
<p/>After standing with the bridle over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) turned to walk down the hill.
<p/>After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won't trust your fore-legs till I get you on the level,'' said this hoarse messenger, glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) mare.
<p/>'' That's a coincidence, too,'' the guard mused, <div class="bookquote">``for I made the same of it myself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>'' '' `Recalled to life.'
<p/>That's a Blazing strange message. Much of that wouldn't do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You'd be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!
<p/>A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other.
<p/>A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it!
<p/>No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all.
<p/>No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged.
<p/>It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page.
<p/>It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore.
<p/>My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end.
<p/>In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?
<p/>As to this, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London.
<p/>So with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) own coach and six, or his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) own coach and sixty, with the breadth of a county between him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) and the next.
<p/>The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) own counsel, and to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hat cocked over his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too far apart.
<p/>They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and throat, which descended nearly to the wearer's knees.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) stopped for drink, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) moved this muffler with his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) left hand, only while he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) poured his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) liquor in with his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) right; as soon as that was done, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) muffled again.
<p/>'' III. The Night Shadows Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. '' No, Jerry, no!'' said the messenger, harping on one theme as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) rode.
<p/>'' It wouldn't do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn't suit your line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>)'d been a drinking!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) message perplexed his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) mind to that degree that he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) was fain, several times, to take off his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) hat to scratch his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) head.
<p/>Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and growing down hill almost to his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) broad, blunt nose.
<p/>It was so like Smith's work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trotted back with the message he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to deliver to the night watchman in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) box at the door of Tellson's Bank, by Temple Bar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took such shapes to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) private topics of uneasiness.
<p/>'' They seemed to be numerous, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) shied at every shadow on the road. What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside.
<p/>To whom, likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested. Tellson's Bank had a run upon it in the mail.
<p/>As the bank passenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in it to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) from pounding against the next passenger, and driving him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt--nodded in his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) place, with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business.
<p/>The rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson's, with all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time.
<p/>Then the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson's, with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger -LRB-and it was not a little that he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) knew about them-RRB-, opened before him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) went in among them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) had last seen them.
<p/>But, though the bank was almost always with him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>), and though the coach -LRB-in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate-RRB- was always with him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all through the night.
<p/>Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state.
<p/>Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another; so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands and figures.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way to dig some one out of a grave. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was prematurely white.
<p/>A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre: <div class="bookquote">``Buried how long? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the passenger</b></font>)</div>The answer was always the same: <div class="bookquote">``Almost eighteen years.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Long ago. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know that you are recalled to life?''

Will you come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)?''
<p/>The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes the broken reply was, <div class="bookquote">``Wait! It would kill me if I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) too soon.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was, <div class="bookquote">``Take me to her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it was, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>).
<p/>After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) fancy would dig, and dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) hands--to dig this wretched creature out.
<p/>I don't understand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Got out at last, with earth hanging about his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) face and hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) would suddenly fan away to dust.
<p/>The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the reality of mist and rain on his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>Yet even when his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within.
<p/>The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express sent after him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), and the real message returned, would all be there.
<p/>Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) would accost it again. '' Buried how long?
<p/>Dig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) to pull up the window, draw his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) arm securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slumbering forms, until his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid away into the bank and the grave. ''

'' <div class="bookquote">``Almost eighteen years.
<p/>The words were still in his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hearing as just spoken--distinctly in his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hearing as ever spoken words had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) life--when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the shadows of the night were gone.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Long ago. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun.
<p/>There was a ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood, in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees.
<p/>Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear, and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful. '' Eighteen years!'' said the passenger, looking at the sun.
<p/>When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon, the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) custom was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon.
<p/>By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations.
<p/>The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather like a larger dog-kennel.
<p/>Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.
<p/>'' Gracious Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years! '' IV. The Preparation '' There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?''
<p/>'' Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir.
<p/>Bed, sir?'' <div class="bookquote">``I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And then breakfast, sir?
<p/>Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please. Show Concord! Gentleman's valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off gentleman's boots in Concord.
<p/>The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it, all kinds and varieties of men came out of it.
<p/>Consequently, another drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) breakfast.
<p/>-LRB-You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.-RRB- Fetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!'' The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman in brown.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sat, with its light shining on him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), waiting for the meal, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sat so still, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might have been sitting for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) portrait.
<p/>Very orderly and methodical he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked, with a hand on each knee, and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) flapped waist-coat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had a good leg, and was a little vain of it, for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a fine texture; his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stockings, was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea.
<p/>A face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson's Bank.
<p/>But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson's Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) had a healthy colour in his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) cheeks, and his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety. Completing his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) resemblance to a man who was sitting for his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) portrait, Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep.
<p/>The arrival of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breakfast roused him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said to the drawer, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) chair to it: <div class="bookquote">``I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may only ask for a gentleman from Tellson's Bank. Please to let me know.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, sir. Tellson's Bank in London, sir?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards
<p/>betwixt London and Paris, sir. A vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company's House. '' '' Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.''
<p/>'' Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir? '' <div class="bookquote">``Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last from France.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people's time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.''
<p/>But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen years ago?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe so.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from the truth.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Rounding his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mouth and both his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) stepped backward from the table, the waiter shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) napkin from his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) right arm to his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) left, dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower.
<p/>'' '' Indeed, sir! According to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages. When Mr. Lorry had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breakfast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) went out for a stroll on the beach.
<p/>The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich.
<p/>The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction.
<p/>The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea.
<p/>A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood.
<p/>Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.
<p/>As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry's thoughts seemed to cloud too.
<p/>When it was dark, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) dinner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breakfast, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind was busily digging, digging, digging, in the live red coals.
<p/>A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him (<font color='blue'><b>digger</b></font>) out of work.
<p/>Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.
<p/>It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) set down his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) glass untouched.
<p/>In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from Tellson's.
<p/>Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson's immediately, if it suited his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pleasure and convenience.
<p/>The gentleman from Tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) odd little flaxen wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette's apartment.
<p/>'' This is Mam`selle!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). '' So soon?'' It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables.
<p/>These had been oiled and oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if they were buried, in deep graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out.
<p/>The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall candles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) saw standing to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) by the table between them and the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak, and still holding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand.
<p/>As his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own with an inquiring look, and a forehead with a singular capacity -LRB-remembering how young and smooth it was-RRB-, of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), of a child whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arms on the passage across that very Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high.
<p/>The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>), on the frame of which, a hospital procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender--and he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) formal bow to Miss Manette.
<p/>'' Pray take a seat, sir. '' In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.
<p/>I kiss your hand, miss,'' said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier date, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) formal bow again, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) seat.
<p/>'' '' I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that some intelligence--or discovery-- '' '' The word is not material, miss; either word will do.''
<p/>''--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so long dead--'' Mr. Lorry moved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) chair, and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids.
<p/>As if they had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets! '' --rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank,
<p/>so good as to be despatched to Paris for the purpose.'' <div class="bookquote">``Myself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' As I was prepared to hear, sir.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) curtseyed to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) -LRB-young ladies made curtseys in those days-RRB-, with a pretty desire to convey to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) felt how much older and wiser he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was than she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself, during the journey, under that worthy gentleman's protection.
<p/>The gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to beg the favour of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) waiting for me here.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) another bow. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``I was happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``to be entrusted with the charge. I shall be more happy to execute it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>It was told me by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature.
<p/>I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are.''
<p/>'' After a pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears, ``It is very difficult to begin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Naturally,'' said Mr. Lorry. '' Yes--I-- '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) did not begin, but, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) indecision, met her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) glance.
<p/>The young forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty and characteristic, besides being singular--and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand, as if with an involuntary action she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) caught at, or stayed some passing shadow.
<p/>'' Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?'' <div class="bookquote">``Am I not? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands, and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile.
<p/>Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression deepened itself as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had hitherto remained standing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mused, and the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes again, went on: <div class="bookquote">``In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you as a young English lady, Miss Manette?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' If you please, sir.'' ``Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to acquit myself of.
<p/>In your reception of it, don't heed me any more than if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed wilfully to mistake the word she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) had repeated, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, in a hurry, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers.
<p/>I will, with your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Story!''

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>trustee</b></font>) affairs, like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson's hands. These are mere business relations, miss; there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like sentiment.
<p/>I have passed from one to another, in the course of my business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere machine.

<p/>Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) put it with some ceremony to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lips.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) then conducted the young lady straightway to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair again, and, holding the chair-back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) left hand, and using his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) right by turns to rub his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) chin, pull his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wig at the ears, or point what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said, stood looking down into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat looking up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).
<p/>And you will see how truly I spoke of myself just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect that I have never seen you since.
<p/>No; you have been the ward of Tellson's House since, and I have been busy with the other business of Tellson's House since.
<p/>I am almost sure it was you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Miss Manette, it was I. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance of them.
<p/>After this odd description of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry flattened his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) flaxen wig upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head with both hands -LRB-which was most unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before-RRB-, and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) former attitude.
<p/>I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle. '' '' So far, miss -LRB-as you have remarked-RRB-, this is the story of your regretted father.
<p/>Now comes the difference. If your father had not died when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did--Don't be frightened! How you start! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) did, indeed, start.
<p/>Pray,'' said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in so violent a tremble: <div class="bookquote">``pray control your agitation--a matter of business.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) look so discomposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stopped, wandered, and began anew: <div class="bookquote">``As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had suddenly and silently disappeared; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had been spirited away; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could trace him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>); if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wife had implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) wrist with both her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands.

<p/>Now if this doctor's wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit, had suffered so intensely from this cause before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little child was born--

<p/>If you could kindly mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging.
<p/>Without directly answering to this appeal, she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) sat so still when he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had very gently raised her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>), and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.
<p/>I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind. '' '' That's right, that's right. Courage!
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) unavailing search for your father, she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) left you, at two years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said the words he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked down, with an admiring pity, on the flowing golden hair; as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey.
<p/>You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you.
<p/>Business! You have business before you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with you. '' '' There has been no new discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--
<p/>The expression in the forehead, which had so particularly attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) notice, and which was now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrist held closer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stopped. '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has been--been found. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is alive. Greatly changed, it is too probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.
<p/>Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) if I can: you, to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, in a low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) were saying it in a dream, <div class="bookquote">``I am going to see his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Ghost!
<p/>Still, alive. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>A shiver ran through her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) frame, and from it through his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). It will be his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Ghost--not him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!'' Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm.
<p/>You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) dear side.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``I have been free, I have been happy, yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) Ghost has never haunted me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only one thing more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) attention: <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) has been found under another name; his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own, long forgotten or long concealed.
<p/>It would be worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) has been for years overlooked, or always designedly held prisoner.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>There, there, there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you, now. '' It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries, because it would be dangerous.
<p/>Better not to mention the subject, anywhere or in any way, and to remove him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)--for a while at all events--out of France.
<p/>Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even Tellson's, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of the matter.
<p/>I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring to it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, `Recalled to Life;' which may mean anything.
<p/>Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) chair, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) sat under his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) hand, utterly insensible; with her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eyes open and fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>So close was her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hold upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) arm, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) feared to detach himself lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) should hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>); therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) called out loudly for assistance without moving.
<p/>A wild-looking woman, whom even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head a most wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too, or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the inn servants, and soon settled the question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) detachment from the poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) chest, and sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) flying back against the nearest wall.
<p/>But what is the matter! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doesn't notice a word! Miss Manette! '' -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``I really think this must be a man!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>was Mr. Lorry's breathless reflection, simultaneously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) coming against the wall.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Why, look at you all! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the inn servants</b></font>)</div>bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants.
<p/>'' Why don't you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring at me? I am not so much to look at, am I?
<p/>Why don't you go and fetch things? I'll let you know, if you don't bring smelling-salts, cold water, and vinegar, quick, I will.
<p/>There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) with great skill and gentleness: calling her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``my precious!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``my bird!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and spreading her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) golden hair aside over her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shoulders with great pride and care.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry; <div class="bookquote">``couldn't you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) what you had to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), without frightening her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to death?

'' Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pretty pale face and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cold hands. Do you call that being a Banker?
<p/>Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of <div class="bookquote">``letting them know''  (<font color='red'><b>the inn servants</b></font>)</div>something not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) charge by a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drooping head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>'' '' I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will do well now,'' said Mr. Lorry. '' No thanks to you in brown, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does.
<p/>My darling pretty!'' <div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility, <div class="bookquote">``that you accompany Miss Manette to France?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A likely thing, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the strong woman. '' '' This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it.
<p/>The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.
<p/>All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine.
<p/>The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size.
<p/>Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers.
<p/>Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants' mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish.
<p/>There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.
<p/>A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women, and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted.
<p/>V. The Wine-shop A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness.
<p/>There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together.
<p/>When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out.
<p/>The man who had left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw sticking in the firewood he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was cutting, set it in motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of hot ashes, at which she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been trying to soften the pain in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own starved fingers and toes, or in those of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) child, returned to it; men with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.
<p/>The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled.
<p/>The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) baby, was stained with the stain of the old rag she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wound about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head again.
<p/>Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled upon a wall with his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.
<p/>The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.
<p/>And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary gleam had driven from his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) sacred countenance, the darkness of it was heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them; but, most especially the last.
<p/>Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook.
<p/>The mill which had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh, was the sigh, Hunger.
<p/>It had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many wooden shoes. It was prevalent everywhere.
<p/>Hunger was pushed out of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal, among its refuse, of anything to eat.
<p/>Hunger was the inscription on the baker's shelves, written in every small loaf of his (<font color='blue'><b>baker</b></font>) scanty stock of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale.
<p/>Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant drops of oil.
<p/>A narrow winding street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill.
<p/>Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay.
<p/>Depressed and slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or inflicting.
<p/>The trade signs -LRB-and they were almost as many as the shops-RRB- were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of meagre loaves.
<p/>The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops, croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were gloweringly confidential together.
<p/>Nothing was represented in a flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler's knives and axes were sharp and bright, the smith's hammers were heavy, and the gunmaker's stock was murderous.
<p/>The crippling stones of the pavement, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off abruptly at the doors.
<p/>The kennel, to make amends, ran down the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses.
<p/>Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea.
<p/>For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) method, and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their condition.
<p/>But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of song and feather, took no warning.
<p/>The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle for the lost wine.
<p/>Indeed they were at sea, and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest. '' It's not my affair,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), with a final shrug of the shoulders.
<p/>'' The people from the market did it. Let them bring another. '' There, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) joke, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) called to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) across the way:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there? ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The fellow pointed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspard</b></font>) joke with immense significance, as is often the way with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspard</b></font>) tribe.
<p/>It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is often the way with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspard</b></font>) tribe too. '' What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?
<p/>'' said the wine-shop keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it.
<p/>'' Why do you write in the public streets? Is there--tell me thou --is there no other place to write such words in?
<p/>The joker rapped it with his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude, with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) stained shoes jerked off his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) foot into his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) hand, and held out.
<p/>'' In his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) expostulation he (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) cleaner hand -LRB-perhaps accidentally, perhaps not-RRB- upon the joker's heart. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly practical character, he (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) looked, under those circumstances.
<p/>With that advice, he (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) soiled hand upon the joker's dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>joker</b></font>) account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.
<p/>This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a bitter day, he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) wore no coat, but carried one slung over his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>'' Put it on, put it on,'' said the other. '' Call wine, wine; and finish there. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) brown arms were bare to the elbows.
<p/>Neither did he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) wear anything more on his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) head than his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) own crisply-curling short dark hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) was a dark man altogether, with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them.
<p/>Good-humoured looking on the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn the man.
<p/>Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own age, with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of manner.
<p/>There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might have predicated that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presided.
<p/>Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, though not to the concealment of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) large earrings.
<p/>Madame Defarge, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) came in. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knitting was before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had laid it down to pick her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) teeth with a toothpick.
<p/>Thus engaged, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right elbow supported by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough.
<p/>This, in combination with the lifting of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) darkly defined eyebrows over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) toothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would do well to look round the shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stepped over the way.
<p/>The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) eyes about, until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in a corner.
<p/>Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) passed behind the counter, he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, <div class="bookquote">``This is our man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What the devil do you do in that galley there?'' said Monsieur Defarge to himself; <div class="bookquote">``I don't know you. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.
<p/>'' How goes it, Jacques?'' said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. '' Is all the spilt wine swallowed?'' ''
<p/>When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge, picking her (<font color='blue'><b>customers</b></font>) teeth with her (<font color='blue'><b>customers</b></font>) toothpick, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her (<font color='blue'><b>customers</b></font>) eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
<p/>It is not often,'' said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur Defarge, <div class="bookquote">``that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death.
<p/>At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still using her (<font color='blue'><b>customers</b></font>) toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her (<font color='blue'><b>customers</b></font>) eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
<p/>The last of the three now said his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) say, as he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) empty drinking vessel and smacked his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) lips.
<p/>Every drop, Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>answered Monsieur Defarge. '' Is it not so, Jacques?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is so, Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Monsieur Defarge returned. '' Ah!
<p/>So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques.
<p/>This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) toothpick by, kept her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyebrows up, and slightly rustled in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seat.
<p/>Am I right, Jacques?'' <div class="bookquote">``You are right, Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>was the response of Monsieur Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``Hold then! True! ''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>muttered her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) husband.
<p/>'' Gentlemen--my wife!'' The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three flourishes. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) acknowledged their homage by bending her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head, and giving them a quick look.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop, took up her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit, and became absorbed in it.
<p/>The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the fifth floor.
<p/>The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here,'' pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``near to the window of my establishment.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Gentlemen</b></font>)</div>Gentlemen,'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) husband, who had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bright eye observantly upon her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``good day. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been there, and can show the way.
<p/>The eyes of Monsieur Defarge were studying his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) corner, and begged the favour of a word.
<p/>Gentlemen, adieu!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>They paid for their wine, and left the place. '' Willingly, sir,'' said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to the door.
<p/>Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had not lasted a minute, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) nodded and went out.
<p/>The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.
<p/>Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus, joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) had directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) own company just before.
<p/>It opened from a stinking little black courtyard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited by a great number of people.
<p/>In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) old master, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) lips.
<p/>It was a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable transformation had come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) in a few seconds.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) had no good-humour in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret, angry, dangerous man.
<p/>'' It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly. '' Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began ascending the stairs.
<p/>'' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) alone? '' the latter whispered. '' Alone! God help him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), who should be with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!'' said the other, in the same low voice.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was, when I first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) after they found me and demanded to know if I would take him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and, at my peril be discreet--as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was then, so he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is now.
<p/>'' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) always alone, then?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own desire? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own necessity. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is greatly changed?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Changed!''  (<font color='red'><b>The keeper</b></font>)</div>The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) hand, and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so forcible.
<p/>Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses.
<p/>Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say, the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides flinging other refuse from its own windows.
<p/>The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable.
<p/>Mr. Lorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) two companions ascended higher and higher. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay.
<p/>Yielding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own disturbance of mind, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) young companion's agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest.
<p/>Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in.
<p/>Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.
<p/>There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story was reached.
<p/>The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat
<p/>At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the third time. he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) carried over his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shoulder, took out a key.
<p/>'' The door is locked then, my friend?'' said Mr. Lorry, surprised. '' Ay. Yes,'' was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.
<p/>'' You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?'' <div class="bookquote">``I think it necessary to turn the key. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ear, and frowned heavily. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why! Because he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has lived so long, locked up, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would be frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to
<p/>I know not what harm--if his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) door was left open.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Lorry. '' Is it possible! '' repeated Defarge, bitterly.
<p/>And a beautiful world we live in, when it is possible, and when many other such things are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under that sky there, every day.
<p/>This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word of it had reached the young lady's ears.
<p/>But, by this time she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) trembled under such strong emotion, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face expressed such deep anxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to speak a word or two of reassurance.
<p/>'' Yes. Long live the Devil. Let us go on. '' '' Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over.
<p/>Then, all the good you bring to him (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>), all the relief, all the happiness you bring to him (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>), begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.
<p/>That's well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business! '' They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were soon at the top.
<p/>There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall.
<p/>On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop.
<p/>'' I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,'' explained Monsieur Defarge. '' Leave us, good boys; we have business here.
<p/>There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr. Lorry asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in a whisper, with a little anger: <div class="bookquote">``Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The three glided by, and went silently down. <div class="bookquote">``I show him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that well?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I think it is well. '' '' Who are the few? How do you choose them?'' <div class="bookquote">``I choose them as real men, of my name--
<p/>Jacques is my name--to whom the sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.
<p/>Soon raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) head again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) struck twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to make a noise there.
<p/>With the same intention, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) drew the key across it, three or four times, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) put it clumsily into the lock, and turned it as heavily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) could.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall. The door slowly opened inward under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) looked into the room and said something.
<p/>A faint voice answered something. Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) looked back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) shoulder, and beckoned them to enter.
<p/>Mr. Lorry got his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm securely round the daughter's waist, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was sinking. ''
<p/>A-a-a-business, business! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) urged, with a moisture that was not of business shining on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) cheek. <div class="bookquote">``Come in, come in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) answered, shuddering. '' Of it? What?'' '' I mean of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>). Of my father. ''
<p/>Rendered in a manner desperate, by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) state and by the beckoning of their conductor, he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) drew over his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) neck the arm that shook upon his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) shoulder, lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a little, and hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) into the room.
<p/>Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside, took out the key again, and held it in his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) sat her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) down just within the door, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>). All this he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) did, methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) could make.
<p/>Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was. He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) stopped there, and faced round.
<p/>The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any other door of French construction.
<p/>To exclude the cold, one half of this door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.
<p/>Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity.
<p/>Yet, work of that kind was being done in the garret; for, with his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) back towards the door, and his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) face towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.
<p/>It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the salutation, as if it were at a distance: <div class="bookquote">``Good day!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>VI. The Shoemaker <div class="bookquote">``Good day!''  (<font color='red'><b>Shoemaker</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking. <div class="bookquote">``You are still hard at work, I see?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the voice replied, <div class="bookquote">``Yes--I am working. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the questioner</b></font>)</div>This time, a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.
<p/>The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it.
<p/>Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago.
<p/>So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain.
<p/>So expressive it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller, wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.
<p/>Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood, was not yet empty.
<p/>I want,'' said Defarge, who had not removed his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) gaze from the shoemaker, <div class="bookquote">``to let in a little more light here.
<p/>So sunken and suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the shoemaker</b></font>)</div>You can bear a little more? ''
<p/>The shoemaker stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) work; looked with a vacant air of listening, at the floor on one side of him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>); then similarly, at the floor on the other side of him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>); then, upward at the speaker.
<p/>'' What did you say?'' <div class="bookquote">``You can bear a little more light?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must bear it, if you let it in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word.-RRB- The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that angle for the time.
<p/>A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) lap, pausing in his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) labour.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) feet and on his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) bench. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes.
<p/>The hollowness and thinness of his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) face would have caused them to look large, under his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) yet dark eyebrows and his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) confused white hair, though they had been really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) old canvas frock, and his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) loose stockings, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) body to be withered and worn. He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) had put up a hand between his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) eyes and the light, and the very bones of it seemed transparent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) never looked at the figure before him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>), without first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) had lost the habit of associating place with sound; he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) never spoke, without first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze, pausing in his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) work. '' Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?
<p/>'' asked Defarge, motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward. '' What did you say?'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don't know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But, the question reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) bent over it again.
<p/>Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker looked up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the unsteady fingers of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) hands strayed to his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) lips as he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) looked at it -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) lips and his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) nails were of the same pale lead-colour-RRB-, and then the hand dropped to his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) once more bent over the shoe.
<p/>The look and the action had occupied but an instant. '' You have a visitor, you see,'' said Monsieur Defarge. ''
<p/>What did you say?'' <div class="bookquote">``Here is a visitor. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The shoemaker</b></font>)</div>The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) work.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge. '' Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) sees one. Show him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) that shoe you are working at.
<p/>Take it, monsieur. '' Mr. Lorry took it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand. '' Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker's name.
<p/>'' There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied: <div class="bookquote">``I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the shoemaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said, couldn't you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur's information?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is a lady's shoe. It is a young lady's walking-shoe.
<p/>It is in the present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.
<p/>Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) had no work to hold, he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) bearded chin, and so on in regular changes, without a moment's intermission.
<p/>The task of recalling him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) from the vagrancy into which he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) always sank when he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a fast-dying man.
<p/>'' And the maker's name?'' said Defarge. '' Did you ask me for my name?'' <div class="bookquote">``Assuredly I did.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' One Hundred and Five, North Tower.''
<p/>With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bent to work again, until the silence was again broken.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' One Hundred and Five, North Tower. '' '' You are not a shoemaker by trade?'' said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would have transferred the question to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>): but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground.
<p/>'' I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I-I learnt it here. I taught myself.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) started, and resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a subject of last night.
<p/>I asked leave to--'' He (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) hands the whole time. ''
<p/>I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) hand for the shoe that had been taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>), Mr. Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face: <div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The shoe dropped to the ground, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat looking fixedly at the questioner. <div class="bookquote">``Monsieur Manette'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>; Mr. Lorry laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand upon Defarge's arm; <div class="bookquote">``do you remember nothing of this man?
<p/>Look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Look at me. Is there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your mind, Monsieur Manette?
<p/>As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr. Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).
<p/>And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who had crept along the wall to a point where she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and where she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) off and shut out the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), but which were now extending towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) warm young breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression repeated -LRB-though in stronger characters-RRB- on her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fair young face, that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>They were overclouded again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. Darkness had fallen on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in its place.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked at the two, less and less attentively, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in the old way.
<p/>Finally, with a deep long sigh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) took the shoe up, and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) work. '' Have you recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), monsieur?
<p/>At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so well.
<p/>'' asked Defarge in a whisper. '' Yes; for a moment. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat.
<p/>There was something awful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stooped over his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) labour.
<p/>Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stood, like a spirit, beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) work.
<p/>It happened, at length, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had occasion to change the instrument in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shoemaker's knife. It lay on that side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) which was not the side on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had taken it up, and was stooping to work again, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes caught the skirt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) dress. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) raised them, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face.
<p/>The two spectators started forward, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stayed them with a motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had no fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) striking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) with the knife, though they had.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) with a fearful look, and after a while his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lips began to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them.
<p/>With the tears streaming down her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) two hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lips, and kissed them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>); then clasped them on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breast, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) ruined head there.
<p/>By degrees, in the pauses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) quick and laboured breathing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was heard to say: <div class="bookquote">``What is this? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>You are not the gaoler's daughter?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sighed <div class="bookquote">``No. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' Who are you? '' Not yet trusting the tones of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sat down on the bench beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).
<p/>A strange thrill struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) did so, and visibly passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) frame; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) laid the knife down softly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) recoiled, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) golden hair, which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed aside, and fell down over her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) neck.
<p/>Advancing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand by little and little, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shoemaking.
<p/>After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to be sure that it was really there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) work, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) opened this, carefully, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knee, and it contained a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden hairs, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had, in some old day, wound off upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) finger.
<p/>But not for long. Releasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hair into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand again, and looked closely at it.
<p/>'' It is the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!'' As the concentrated expression returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) forehead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had laid her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned out--she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) full to the light, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). '' You will leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they may in the spirit.'
<p/>Those were the words I said. I remember them very well. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) formed this speech with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lips many times before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could utter it.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) did find spoken words for it, they came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) coherently, though slowly. '' How was this?-- Was it you ?''
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sat perfectly still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) grasp, and only said, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near us, do not speak, do not move!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Once more, the two spectators started, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) turned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with a frightful suddenness. <div class="bookquote">``Hark!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) exclaimed. '' Whose voice was that?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands released her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) uttered this cry, and went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) white hair, which they tore in a frenzy.
<p/>It died out, as everything but his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shoemaking did die out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) refolded his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) little packet and tried to secure it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breast; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) still looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and gloomily shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head.
<p/>These are not the hands she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knew, this is not the face she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knew, this is not a voice she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ever heard.
<p/>'' '' No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can't be. See what the prisoner is. No, no.
<p/>Hailing his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) softened tone and manner, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) daughter fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) knees before him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) appealing hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) breast.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was--and He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. What is your name, my gentle angel? '' ''
<p/>O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was, and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history.
<p/>All that I may tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless me.
<p/>But I cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!''
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cold white head mingled with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) radiant hair, which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>If you hear in my voice--I don't know that it is so, but I hope it is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it!
<p/>If you touch, in touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it!
<p/>If, when I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away, weep for it, weep for it!''
<p/>If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste, and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it!
<p/>And if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living, and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father, and implore his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pardon for having never for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sake
<p/>striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of my poor mother hid his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) torture from me, weep for it, weep for it!
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) closer round the neck, and rocked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breast like a child. '' Weep for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), then, and for me!
<p/>Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sacred tears upon my face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sobs strike against my heart. O, see!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had sunk in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms, and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face dropped on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breast: a sight so touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.
<p/>When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground.
<p/>Thank God for us, thank God!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay there in a lethargy, worn out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had nestled down with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head might lie upon her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arm; and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hair drooping over him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) curtained him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) from the light.
<p/>If, without disturbing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand to Mr. Lorry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) nose, <div class="bookquote">``all could be arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could be taken away--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' But, consider. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) fit for the journey?'' asked Mr. Lorry. '' More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. '' More than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France.
<p/>That's business,'' said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) methodical manners; <div class="bookquote">``and if business is to be done, I had better do it.
<p/>Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Then be so kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manette/Miss Manette</b></font>)</div>urged Miss Manette, <div class="bookquote">``as to leave us here.
<p/>You see how composed he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) with me now. Why should you be?
<p/>If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), when you come back, as quiet as you leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).
<p/>In any case, I will take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) until you return, and then we will remove him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) straight. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Manette/Miss Manette</b></font>)</div>Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and in favour of one of them remaining.
<p/>But, as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed, for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away to do it.
<p/>Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) head down on the hard ground close at the father's side, and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and meat, wine, and hot coffee.
<p/>Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the lamp he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) carried, on the shoemaker's bench -LRB-there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) feet.
<p/>The darkness deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall. No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind, in the scared blank wonder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face.
<p/>Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knew what had happened, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) recollected what they had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved.
<p/>They tried speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>); but, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was so confused, and so very slow to answer, that they took fright at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) bewilderment, and agreed for the time to tamper with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) no more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had a wild, lost manner of occasionally clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands, that had not been seen in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) before; yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had some pleasure in the mere sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) daughter's voice, and invariably turned to it when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) spoke.
<p/>In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) ate and drank what they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to eat and drink, and put on the cloak and other wrappings, that they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to wear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) readily responded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) daughter's drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and took--and kept--her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own. They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr. Lorry closing the little procession.
<p/>They had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stopped, and stared at the roof and round at the walls.
<p/>'' You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?'' '' What did you say? '' But, before she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could repeat the question, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) murmured an answer as if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had repeated it.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had no recollection whatever of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) having been brought from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) prison to that house, was apparent to them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One Hundred and Five, North Tower;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>On their reaching the courtyard he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) instinctively altered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was no drawbridge, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter's hand and clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head again.
<p/>No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember? No, I don't remember. It was so very long ago. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>They heard him (<font color='blue'><b>passerby</b></font>) mutter, An unnatural silence and desertion reigned there.
<p/>The prisoner had got into a coach, and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) daughter had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), when Mr. Lorry's feet were arrested on the step by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) asking, miserably, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes.
<p/>Madame Defarge immediately called to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would get them, and went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard.
<p/>Only one soul was to be seen, and that was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) quickly brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.
<p/>Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word <div class="bookquote">``To the Barrier!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>The postilion cracked his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) whip, and they clattered away under the feeble over-swinging lamps.
<p/>Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds, illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city gates.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``See here then, Monsieur the Officer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, getting down, and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) gravely apart, <div class="bookquote">``these are the papers of monsieur inside, with the white head.
<p/>Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Your papers, travellers!'' They were consigned to me, with him (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>), at the-- ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Officer</b></font>) voice, there was a flutter among the military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head.
<p/>'' It is well. Forward! '' from the uniform. <div class="bookquote">``Adieu!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>from Defarge. And so, under a short grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great grove of stars.
<p/>Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.
<p/>All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry--sitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and what were capable of restoration--
<p/>the old inquiry: <div class="bookquote">``I hope you care to be recalled to life? ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And the old answer: <div class="bookquote">``I can't say. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The end of the first book. Book the Second--the Golden Thread I. Five Years Later Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty.
<p/>It was an old-fashioned place, moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness, proud of its incommodiousness.
<p/>They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable.
<p/>It was very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious. This was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business.
<p/>Tellson's -LRB-they said-RRB- wanted no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no embellishment. Noakes and Co.'s might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but Tellson's, thank Heaven--!
<p/>In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable.
<p/>Any one of these partners would have disinherited his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellson</b></font>) son on the question of rebuilding Tellson's. Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience.
<p/>After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps, and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar.
<p/>If your business necessitated your seeing <div class="bookquote">``the House,''  (<font color='red'><b>House</b></font>)</div>you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight.
<p/>Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut.
<p/>Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two.
<p/>Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air.
<p/>Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.
<p/>But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson's.
<p/>Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again. Death is Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's?
<p/>Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse at Tellson's door, who made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to Death.
<p/>Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse--but, it cleared off -LRB-as to this world-RRB- the trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after.
<p/>Thus, Tellson's, in its day, like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.
<p/>Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson's, the oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young man into Tellson's London house, they hid him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) somewhere till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was old.
<p/>They kept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a dark place, like a cheese, until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Then only was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.
<p/>Outside Tellson's--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live sign of the house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was never absent during business hours, unless upon an errand, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was represented by his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) son: a grisly urchin of twelve, who was his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) express image.
<p/>The house had always tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted this person to the post.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had received the added appellation of Jerry.
<p/>The scene was Mr. Cruncher's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley, Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March morning, Anno Domini
<p/>-LRB-Mr. Cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name upon it.-RRB-
<p/>Mr. Cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one.
<p/>People understood that Tellson's, in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. seventeen hundred and eighty. But they were very decently kept.
<p/>Early as it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) lay abed was already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth was spread.
<p/>At first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll and surge in bed, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) rose above the surface, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons.
<p/>Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin at home. At which juncture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation: <div class="bookquote">``Bust me, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) ain't at it agin!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees in a corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was the person referred to.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. '' You're at it agin, are you?'' After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) threw a boot at the woman as a third.
<p/>It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher's domestic economy, that, whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.
<p/>'' What,'' said Mr. Cruncher, varying his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) apostrophe after missing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) mark--<div class="bookquote">``what are you up to, Aggerawayter? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was only saying my prayers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saying your prayers! You're a nice woman! What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was not praying against you; I was praying for you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You weren't. And if you were, I won't be took the liberty with. Here! your mother's a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your father's prosperity.
<p/>my boy: going and flopping herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out of the mouth of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only child.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>Master Cruncher -LRB-who was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) shirt-RRB- took this very ill, and, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) personal board.
<p/>And what do you suppose, you conceited female,'' said Mr. Cruncher, with unconscious inconsistency, <div class="bookquote">``that the worth of your prayers may be?
<p/>You've got a dutiful mother, you have, my son. You've got a religious mother, you have, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>Name the price that you put your prayers at!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more than that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Worth</b></font>)</div>'' Worth no more than that,'' repeated Mr. Cruncher.
<p/>'' They ain't worth much, then. Whether or no, I won't be prayed agin, I tell you. I can't afford it.
<p/>If you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and child, and not in opposition to 'em.
<p/>If I had had any but a unnat`ral wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat`ral mother, I might have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck.
<p/>B-u-u-ust me!'' said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) clothes, <div class="bookquote">``if I ain't, what with piety and one blowed thing and another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with!
<p/>Young Jerry, dress yourself, my boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call.
<p/>I'm not a going to be made unlucky by your sneaking. For, I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>here he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) wife once more, <div class="bookquote">``I won't be gone agin, in this manner.
<p/>I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I'm as sleepy as laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn't know, if it wasn't for the pain in 'em, which was me and which somebody else, yet I'm none the better for it in pocket; and it's my suspicion that you've been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket, and I won't put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you say now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Growling, in addition, such phrases as <div class="bookquote">``Ah! yes! You're religious, too. You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child, would you?
<p/>Not you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) boot-cleaning and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) general preparation for business.
<p/>In the meantime, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes, and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) father's did, kept the required watch upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) mother.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals, by darting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) sleeping closet, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) toilet, with a suppressed cry of <div class="bookquote">``You are going to flop, mother.
<p/>--Halloa, father! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in again with an undutiful grin. Mr. Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) breakfast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) resented Mrs. Cruncher's saying grace with particular animosity. '' Now, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again? ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't do it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crunches</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Crunches</b></font>) rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crunches</b></font>) wife's petitions.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Crunches</b></font>) wife explained that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had merely <div class="bookquote">``asked a blessing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' I ain't a going to be blest out of house and home.
<p/>Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Crunches</b></font>) had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed inmate of a menagerie.
<p/>Towards nine o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) smoothed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) ruffled aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) could overlay his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) natural self with, issued forth to the occupation of the day.
<p/>I won't have my wittles blest off my table. Keep still!'' It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) favourite description of himself as ``a honest tradesman.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) stock consisted of a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool, young Jerry, walking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father's side, carried every morning to beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where, with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man's feet, it formed the encampment for the day.
<p/>On this post of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>), Mr. Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar itself,--and was almost as in-looking.
<p/>Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson's, Jerry took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>), when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) amiable purpose.
<p/>Father and son, extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.
<p/>The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) as of everything else in Fleet-street.
<p/>The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson's establishment was put through the door, and the word was given: <div class="bookquote">``Porter wanted!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tellson/Bank/Tellson 's Bank</b></font>)</div><p/>Having thus given his (<font color='blue'><b>Porter</b></font>) parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on the stool, entered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) reversionary interest in the straw his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father had been chewing, and cogitated.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Hooray, father! Here's an early job to begin with! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Al-ways rusty! His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fingers is al-ways rusty! '' muttered young Jerry.
<p/>'' Where does my father get all that iron rust from? He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) don't get no iron rust here! '' II. A Sight
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?''  (<font color='red'><b>clerks</b></font>)</div>said one of the oldest of clerks to Jerry the messenger. '' Ye-es, sir,'' returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner.
<p/>'' I do know the Bailey. '' <div class="bookquote">``Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey.
<p/>Much better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in question, <div class="bookquote">``than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a witness</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) will then let you in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Cruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to interchange the inquiry, <div class="bookquote">``What do you think of this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Into the court, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Into the court. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Am I to wait in the court, sir? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) asked, as the result of that conference.
<p/>The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr. Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry's attention, and show him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) where you stand.
<p/>'' I am going to tell you. Then what you have to do, is, to remain there until he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wants you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That's all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) you are there.
<p/>As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note, Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) in silence until he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) came to the blotting-paper stage, remarked: <div class="bookquote">``I suppose they'll be trying Forgeries this morning?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Treason!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>'' That's quartering,'' said Jerry. <div class="bookquote">``Barbarous!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is the law,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>remarked the ancient clerk, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) surprised spectacles upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>).
<p/>'' It is the law.'' '' It's hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It's hard enough to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but it's wery hard to spile him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sir.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>retained the ancient clerk. '' Speak well of the law. Take care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take care of itself.
<p/>I give you that advice.'' '' It's the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,'' said Jerry. '' I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.''
<p/>'' Well, well,'' said the old clerk; ``we all have our various ways of gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry ways.
<p/>Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal deference than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) made an outward show of, <div class="bookquote">``You are a lean old one, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>made his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) bow, informed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) son, in passing, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) destination, and went his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) way.
<p/>They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.
<p/>But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) off the bench.
<p/>It had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) own doom as certainly as the prisoner's, and even died before him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>).
<p/>For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard, from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.
<p/>Here is the letter. Go along. '' So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning.
<p/>It was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under Heaven.
<p/>Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice illustration of the precept, that <div class="bookquote">``Whatever is is right;''  (<font color='red'><b>Bailey</b></font>)</div>an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.
<p/>Making his (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way quietly, the messenger found out the door he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sought, and handed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter through a trap in it.
<p/>For, people then paid to see the play at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the former entertainment was much the dearer.
<p/>Therefore, all the Old Bailey doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.
<p/>After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into court.
<p/>'' What's on? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) asked, in a whisper, of the man he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) found himself next to. '' Nothing yet. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>returned the man, with a relish; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be taken down and sliced before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own face, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inside will be taken out and burnt while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks on, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head will be chopped off, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be cut into quarters.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>What's coming on?'' <div class="bookquote">``The Treason case. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' The quartering one, eh?'' That's the sentence. '' '' If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s found Guilty, you mean to say?
<p/>'' Jerry added, by way of proviso. '' Oh! they'll find him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) guilty,'' said the other. '' Don't you be afraid of that.
<p/>Mr. Cruncher's attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) saw making his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Mr. Lorry sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged gentleman, the prisoner's counsel, who had a great bundle of papers before him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>): and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court.
<p/>After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) chin and signing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and who quietly nodded and sat down again.
<p/>'' '' What's he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) got to do with the case? '' asked the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spoken with. '' Blest if I know,'' said Jerry.
<p/>'' What have you got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?'' <div class="bookquote">``Blest if I know that either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Jerry.
<p/>The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became the central point of interest.
<p/>Two gaolers, who had been standing there, went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar. Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling, stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<p/>Eager faces strained round pillars and corners, to get a sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); spectators in back rows stood up, not to miss a hair of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); people on the floor of the court, laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help themselves, at anybody's cost, to a view of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)--stood a-tiptoe, got upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<p/>Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had taken as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) came along, and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not, that flowed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>), and already broke upon the great windows behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) in an impure mist and rain.
<p/>The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye.
<p/>All the human breath in the place, rolled at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condition was that of a young gentleman.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was plainly dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair, which was long and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck; more to be out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way than for ornament.
<p/>As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) situation engendered came through the brown upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheek, showing the soul to be stronger than the sun.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was otherwise quite self-possessed, bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet. The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at, was not a sort that elevated humanity.
<p/>had there been a chance of any one of its savage details being spared--by just so much would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have lost in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fascination.
<p/>The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled, was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder, yielded the sensation.
<p/>Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.
<p/>Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to an indictment denouncing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) -LRB-with infinite jingle and jangle-RRB- for that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) having, on divers occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French King, in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation to send to Canada and North America.
<p/>This much, Jerry, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) head becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood there before him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) trial; that the jury were swearing in; and that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.
<p/>The accused, who was -LRB-and who knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) was-RRB- being mentally hanged, beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) was quiet and attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest; and stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) hands resting on the slab of wood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>), so composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) stood in peril of a less horrible sentence-- Silence in the court! The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.
<p/>Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it, and had passed from its surface and this earth
<p/>Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one day to give up its dead.
<p/>Over the prisoner's head there was a mirror, to throw the light down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). 's together. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner's mind.
<p/>Be that as it may, a change in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) position making him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) conscious of a bar of light across his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) looked up; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) saw the glass his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) face flushed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) right hand pushed the herbs away.
<p/>About on a level with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) eyes, there sat, in that corner of the Judge's bench, two persons upon whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) look immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>), turned to them.
<p/>The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind, but pondering and self-communing.
<p/>When this expression was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as it was now, in a moment, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speaking to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became a handsome man, not past the prime of life.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter had one of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hands drawn through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm, as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sat by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and the other pressed upon it.
<p/>It happened, that the action turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face to that side of the court which was on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had drawn close to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) dread of the scene, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) pity for the prisoner.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused.
<p/>This had been so very noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who had had no pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) were touched by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); and the whisper went about, <div class="bookquote">``Who are they?
<p/>Jerry, the messenger, who had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) own observations, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) own manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) absorption, stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) neck to hear who they were.
<p/>The crowd about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and from him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got to Jerry:
<p/>The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them, leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.
<p/>A Disappointment Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) life.
<p/>That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before.
<p/>That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could give no honest account.
<p/>That, if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive -LRB-which happily it never was-RRB-, the real wickedness and guilt of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) business might have remained undiscovered.
<p/>That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the prisoner's schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) Majesty's Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Witnesses.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' For which side? '' <div class="bookquote">``Against.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Against what side?'' '' The prisoner's. '' III. That, this patriot would be produced before them.
<p/>That, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had been the prisoner's friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could no longer cherish in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) bosom, on the sacred altar of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) country.
<p/>That, if statues were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one.
<p/>That, his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) position and attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, as they were not so decreed, he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) probably would not have one.
<p/>That, Virtue, as had been observed by the poets -LRB-in many passages which he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) well knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues; whereat the jury's countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages-RRB-, was in a manner contagious; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.
<p/>That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had communicated itself to the prisoner's servant, and had engendered in him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) a holy determination to examine his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) master's table-drawers and pockets, and secrete his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) papers.
<p/>That, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) -LRB-Mr. Attorney-General-RRB- was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that, in a general way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) preferred him (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) -LRB-Mr. Attorney-General's-RRB- brothers and sisters, and honoured him (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) -LRB-Mr. Attorney-General's-RRB- father and mother.
<p/>That, the evidence of these two witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) Majesty's forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power.
<p/>That, these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner's handwriting; but that it was all the same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as showing the prisoner to be artful in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) precautions.
<p/>That, the proof would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.
<p/>That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knew they were-RRB-, and being a responsible jury -LRB-as they knew they were-RRB-, must positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), whether they liked it or not.
<p/>That, they never could lay their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon pillows at all, unless the prisoner's head was taken off.
<p/>That head Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith of his (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) solemn asseveration that he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone.
<p/>When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in anticipation of what he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was soon to become.
<p/>That, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise. When toned down again, the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.
<p/>The story of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) pure soul was exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be--perhaps, if it had a fault, a little too exactly.
<p/>Having released his (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) noble bosom of its burden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before him (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>), sitting not far from Mr. Lorry, begged to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) a few questions.
<p/>Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his (<font color='blue'><b>Solicitor-General</b></font>) leader's lead, examined the patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The wigged gentleman sitting opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ever been a spy himself? No, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) scorned the base insinuation. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) live upon? His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) property. Where was his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) property?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) didn't precisely remember where it was. What was it? No business of anybody's. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) inherited it? Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had.
<p/>From whom? Distant relation. Very distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly not. Never in a debtors' prison? Didn't see what that had to do with it.
<p/>Never in a debtors' prison?--Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many times? Two or three times. Not five or six? Perhaps.
<p/>Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever been kicked? Might have been. Frequently? No. Ever kicked downstairs? Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell downstairs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gentleman</b></font>) own accord.
<p/>Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault, but it was not true.
<p/>Swear it was not true? Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not more than other gentlemen do.
<p/>Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?
<p/>Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes. Ever pay him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)? No. No. Sure he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain.
<p/>Knew no more about the lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance? No. Expect to get anything by this evidence?
<p/>No. Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps ? Oh dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear no.
<p/>Swear that? Over and over again. No motives but motives of sheer patriotism? None whatever. The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) way through the case at a great rate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais packet, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charity--never thought of such a thing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and simplicity, four years ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) began to have suspicions of the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), soon afterwards.
<p/>In arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) clothes, while travelling, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had seen similar lists to these in the prisoner's pockets, over and over again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and Boulogne.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner's desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had not put them there first. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) country, and couldn't bear it, and had given information.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot; he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be only a plated one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had known the last witness seven or eight years; that was merely a coincidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) didn't call it a particularly curious coincidence; most coincidences were curious.
<p/>Neither did he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) only motive too. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis Lorry. '' Mr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson's bank?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail?''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was therefore travelling under an assumed name.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said that this business had, within a few days, taken him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) to France, and might, at intervals, take him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) backwards and forwards between France and England for a long time to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said that, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on England's part.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the Third.
<p/>'' But there was no harm in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) way of saying this: it was said laughingly, and to beguile the time.
<p/>Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when she (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon the counsel for and against.
<p/>Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness, when the Judge looked up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington.
<p/>Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Attorney-General</b></font>) deemed it necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady's father, Doctor Manette.
<p/>'' Who was called accordingly. '' Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) before?'' <div class="bookquote">``Once. When he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) called at my lodgings in London.

(<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) answered, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``There is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) answered, in a tone that went to every heart, <div class="bookquote">``A long imprisonment.''

My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say
<p/>what time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had become familiar.
<p/>I have no remembrance of the process. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down together. A singular circumstance then arose in the case.
<p/>The object in hand being to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked, in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) did not remain, but from which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) travelled back some dozen miles or more, to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness was called to identify him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) as having been at the precise time required, in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town, waiting for another person.
<p/>The prisoner's counsel was cross-examining this witness with no result, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<p/>Opening this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner. ''
<p/>You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner? '' The witness was quite sure. '' Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?
<p/>Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,'' pointing to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) who had tossed the paper over, <div class="bookquote">``and then look well upon the prisoner.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Not so like -LRB-the witness said-RRB- as that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) could be mistaken. '' How say you? Are they very like each other?''
<p/>slovenly if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise, not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought into comparison.
<p/>My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became much more remarkable.
<p/>My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver -LRB-the prisoner's counsel-RRB-, whether they were next to try Mr. Carton -LRB-name of my learned friend-RRB- for treason?
<p/>But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) would ask the witness to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) whether what happened once, might happen twice; whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) would have been so confident if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had seen this illustration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) rashness sooner, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) would be so confident, having seen it; and more.
<p/>The upshot of which, was, to smash this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) part of the case to useless lumber.
<p/>Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) following of the evidence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) had now to attend while Mr. Stryver fitted the prisoner's case on the jury, like a compact suit of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>) certainly did look rather like.
<p/>How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) friend and partner, and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family affairs in France, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) being of French extraction, did require his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) making those passages across the Channel--though what those affairs were, a consideration for others who were near and dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), forbade him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), even for his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) life, to disclose.
<p/>How the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.
<p/>How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it; how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the State Trials of this country were full.
<p/>But, there my Lord interposed -LRB-with as grave a face as if it had not been true-RRB-, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) could not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.
<p/>Mr. Stryver then called his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr. Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and Cly were even a hundred times better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) had thought them, and the prisoner a hundred times worse.
<p/>Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.
<p/>Allowing for my learned friend's appearance being careless and And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.
<p/>Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court, changed neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) place nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) attitude, even in this excitement.
<p/>While his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) papers before him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>), whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) seat, and slowly paced up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) platform, not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) state was feverish; this one man sat leaning back, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) torn gown half off him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) head after its removal, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) pockets, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day.
<p/>Something especially reckless in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) demeanour, not only gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) undoubtedly bore to the prisoner -LRB-which his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) momentary earnestness, when they were compared together, had strengthened-RRB-, that many of the lookers-on, taking note of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) now, said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike.
<p/>Mr. Cruncher made the observation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) next neighbour, and added, <div class="bookquote">``I'd hold half a guinea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) don't get no law-work to do.
<p/>Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette's head dropped upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father's breast, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was the first to see it, and to say audibly:
<p/>Don't look like the sort of one to get any, do he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>neighbour</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Officer! look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) out.
<p/>Don't you see she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will fall! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There was much commiseration for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was removed, and much sympathy with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had shown strong internal agitation when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was questioned, and that pondering or brooding look which made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old, had been upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), like a heavy cloud, ever since.
<p/>It had evidently been a great distress to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), to have the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) imprisonment recalled. As he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a moment, spoke, through their foreman.
<p/>My Lord -LRB-perhaps with George Washington on his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) mind-RRB- showed some surprise that they were not agreed, but signified his (<font color='blue'><b>Washington</b></font>) pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward, and retired himself.
<p/>They were not agreed, and wished to retire. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in the court were now being lighted.
<p/>It began to be rumoured that the jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat down.
<p/>Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father went out, now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest, could easily get near him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>).
<p/>'' Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in the way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in.
<p/>Don't be a moment behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long before I can.
<p/>'' Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came up at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.
<p/>'' How is the young lady?'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is greatly distressed; but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father is comforting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feels the better for being out of court.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>), all eyes, ears, and spikes. '' Mr. Darnay!
<p/>'' The prisoner came forward directly. '' You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) will do very well.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) stood, half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) elbow against the bar. '' I do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Carton, still only half turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do you expect, Mr. Darnay?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' The worst.'' '' It's the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest.
<p/>Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other in manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above them.
<p/>An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale.
<p/>The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) along with them.
<p/>But I think their withdrawing is in your favour. '' <div class="bookquote">``Jerry! Jerry! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) got there.
<p/>'' Here, sir! It's a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!'' Mr. Lorry handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) a paper through the throng.
<p/>If you had sent the message, `Recalled to Life,' again,'' muttered Jerry, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) turned, <div class="bookquote">``I should have known what you meant, this time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) legs, and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search of other carrion.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Quick! Have you got it?'' '' Yes, sir.'' Hastily written on the paper was the word <div class="bookquote">``ACQUITTED.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' IV.
<p/>Congratulatory From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr. Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) escape from death.
<p/>It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the shoemaker of the garret in Paris.
<p/>Yet, no one could have looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) low grave voice, and to the abstraction that overclouded him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) fitfully, without any apparent reason.
<p/>While one external cause, and that a reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) long lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition from the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) soul, it was also in its nature to arise of itself, and to draw a gloom over him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>), as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual Bastille thrown upon him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) by a summer sun, when the substance was three hundred miles away.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) was the golden thread that united him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) to a Past beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) misery, and to a Present beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) misery: and the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) voice, the light of her (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) face, the touch of her (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) hand, had a strong beneficial influence with him (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) almost always.
<p/>Not absolutely always, for she (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) could recall some occasions on which her (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) power had failed; but they were few and slight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) believed them over.
<p/>Only his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) mind. Mr. Darnay had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned to Mr. Stryver, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) warmly thanked.
<p/>Mr. Stryver, a man of little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was, stout, loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing way of shouldering himself -LRB-morally and physically-RRB- into companies and conversations, that argued well for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) shouldering his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) way up in life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) still had his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) wig and gown on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) said, squaring himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) late client to that degree that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean out of the group: <div class="bookquote">``I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr. Darnay.
<p/>It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the less likely to succeed on that account. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,''  (<font color='red'><b>client</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) late client, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as another man's, I believe.
<p/>It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, <div class="bookquote">``Much better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again.
<p/>'' '' You think so?'' said Mr. Stryver. '' Well! you have been present all day, and you ought to know.
<p/>And as such,'' quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had previously shouldered him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) out of it--<div class="bookquote">``as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up this conference and order us all to our homes.
<p/>You are a man of business, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I speak for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Lorry, ``and for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver; <div class="bookquote">``I have a night's work to do yet. Speak for yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) the question pointedly, and with a glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear.
<p/>With this strange expression on him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) thoughts had wandered away. '' My father,'' said Lucie, softly laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>). '' Shall we go home, my father? '' With a long breath, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) himself had originated--that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not be released that night.
<p/>The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.
<p/>Walking between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it.
<p/>Another person, who had not joined the group, or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away.
<p/>Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) way back to the robing-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.
<p/>'' So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now? '' Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton's part in the day's proceedings; nobody had known of it.
<p/>If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was unrobed, and was none the better for it in appearance. '' '' Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, <div class="bookquote">``You have mentioned that before, sir.
<p/>We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We have to think of the House more than ourselves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I know, I know,'' rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. '' Don't be nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better, I dare say.
<p/>And indeed, sir,'' pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I really don't know what you have to do with the matter.
<p/>If you'll excuse me, as very much your elder, for saying so, I really don't know that it is your business.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Business! Bless you, I have no business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Carton. '' It is a pity you have not, sir.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' If you had,'' pursued Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps you would attend to it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lord love you, no!--I shouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Carton.
<p/>Well, sir!'' cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) indifference, <div class="bookquote">``business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing.
<p/>And, sir, if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr. Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir! I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life.--Chair there!''
<p/>Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr. Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson's.
<p/>Carton, who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed then, and turned to Darnay: <div class="bookquote">``This is a strange chance that throws you and me together.
<p/>This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hardly seem yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>returned Charles Darnay, <div class="bookquote">``to belong to this world again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't wonder at it; it's not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another.
<p/>You speak faintly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I begin to think I am faint.''  (<font color='red'><b>the devil</b></font>)</div>'' Then why the devil don't you dine? I dined, myself, while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or some other.
<p/>Drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) down Ludgate-hill to Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern.
<p/>Here, they were shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) at the same table, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) separate bottle of port before him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) fully half-insolent manner upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>).
<p/>Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at. '' '' Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr. Darnay?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far mended as to feel that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It must be an immense satisfaction!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) said it bitterly, and filled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) glass again: which was a large one. '' As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.
<p/>It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we are not much alike in that particular.
<p/>'' Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) being there with this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.
<p/>Now your dinner is done,'' Carton presently said, <div class="bookquote">``why don't you call a health, Mr. Darnay; why don't you give your toast?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Indeed, I begin to think we are not much alike in any particular, you and I. '' '' What health? What toast?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I'll swear it's there.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miss Manette, then!''
 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Looking his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) companion full in the face while he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) drank the toast, Carton flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) glass over his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Manette, then! ''  (<font color='red'><b>That a lady</b></font>)</div>That's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) said, filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) new goblet.
<p/>A slight frown and a laconic <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were the answer. '' That's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by!
<p/>How does it feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?''
<p/>Again Darnay answered not a word. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) showed she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was pleased, but I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was.
<p/>The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own free will, assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in the strait of the day.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) for it. '' I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,'' was the careless rejoinder.
<p/>'' It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second.
<p/>Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question. '' '' Willingly, and a small return for your good offices. '' <div class="bookquote">``Do you think I particularly like you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Mr. Carton,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the other, oddly disconcerted, <div class="bookquote">``I have not asked myself the question.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But ask yourself the question now.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I don't think I do,'' said Carton.
<p/>'' I begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.'' <div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, <div class="bookquote">``there is nothing in that
<p/>, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>Carton rejoining, <div class="bookquote">``Nothing in life!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) answering in the affirmative, <div class="bookquote">``Then bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.
<p/>Darnay rang. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Do you call the whole reckoning?'' said Carton. '' The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) good night.
<p/>Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat of defiance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) manner, and said, <div class="bookquote">``A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think I am drunk?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Think? You know I have been drinking.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Since I must say so, I know it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don't let your sober face elate you, however; you don't know what it may come to.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.
<p/>Do you particularly like the man?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered, at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own image; <div class="bookquote">``why should you particularly like a man who resembles you?
<p/>Good night! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' There is nothing in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have made in yourself!
<p/>A good reason for taking to a man, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shows you what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been!
<p/>Change places with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resorted to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few minutes, and fell asleep on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair straggling over the table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Come on, and have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow. '' V. The Jackal Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard.
<p/>So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night, without any detriment to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reputation as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.
<p/>The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr. Stryver, already fast shouldering his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) way to a large and lucrative practice, behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) compeers in this particular, any more than in the drier parts of the legal race.
<p/>A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) mounted.
<p/>Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite, specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench, the florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.
<p/>It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments.
<p/>The more business he (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) got, the greater his (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow; and however late at night he (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) sat carousing with Sydney Carton, he (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) always had his (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) points at his (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) fingers' ends in the morning.
<p/>But, a remarkable improvement came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) as to this. Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's great ally.
<p/>Stryver never had a case in hand, anywhere, but Carton was there, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) pockets, staring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) lodgings, like a dissipated cat.
<p/>At last, it began to get about, among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) was an amazingly good jackal, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.
<p/>What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas, might have floated a king's ship. '' Ten o'clock, sir,'' said the man at the tavern, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had charged to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``ten o'clock, sir.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' What's the matter?'' '' Ten o'clock, sir.'' '' What do you mean? Ten o'clock at night?'' '' Yes, sir.
<p/>After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up, tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat on, and walked out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned into the Temple, and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King's Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.
<p/>Your honour told me to call you.'' '' Oh! I remember. Very well, very well. '' The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone home, and the Stryver principal opened the door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which may be observed in all free livers of his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) class, from the portrait of Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffries</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffries</b></font>) slippers on, and a loose bed-gown, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffries</b></font>) throat was bare for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jeffries</b></font>) greater ease. '' You are a little late, Memory,'' said Stryver.
<p/>'' About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later. '' They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers, where there was a blazing fire.
<p/>A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.
<p/>'' You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.'' '' Two to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day's client; or seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) dine--it's all one!''
<p/>'' That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the identification. How did you come by it?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.
<p/>When did it strike you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Stryver laughed till he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) precocious paunch. '' You and your luck, Sydney!
<p/>Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) dress, went into an adjoining room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel or two.
<p/>Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them out, he (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) folded them on his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down at the table, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Now I am ready!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Get to work, get to work. '' <div class="bookquote">``Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver, gaily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) looked among his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) papers.
<p/>'' How much?'' <div class="bookquote">``Only two sets of them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Give me the worst first. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There they are, Sydney. Fire away! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the jackal</b></font>)</div><p/>The lion then composed himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) back on a sofa on one side of the drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) own paper-bestrewn table proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) task, that his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) eyes did not even follow the hand he (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) stretched out for his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) glass--which often groped about, for a minute or more, before it found the glass for his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) lips.
<p/>Two or three times, the matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on him (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) to get up, and steep his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) towels anew.
<p/>From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin, he (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) anxious gravity.
<p/>The lion took it with care and caution, made his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) selections from it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) remarks upon it, and the jackal assisted both.
<p/>At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and proceeded to offer it to him (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>). When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) waistband again, and lay down to meditate.
<p/>The jackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) throttle, and a fresh application to his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal; this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.
<p/>'' And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,'' said Mr. Stryver. The jackal removed the towels from his (<font color='blue'><b>jackal</b></font>) head, which had been steaming again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.
<p/>'' You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses to-day. Every question told.'' <div class="bookquote">``I always am sound; am I not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to it and smooth it again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the jackal</b></font>)</div>With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.
<p/>The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,'' said Stryver, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) head over him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) reviewed him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) in the present and the past, <div class="bookquote">``the old seesaw Sydney.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and now in despondency!'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the other, sighing: <div class="bookquote">``yes!
<p/>The same Sydney, with the same luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>And why not?'' <div class="bookquote">``God knows. It was my way, I suppose. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) legs stretched out before him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), looking at the fire.
<p/>Carton,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) friend, squaring himself at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with a bullying air, as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) into it, <div class="bookquote">``your way is, and always was, a lame way.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>You summon no energy and purpose. Look at me.'' '' Oh, botheration! '' returned Sydney, with a lighter and more good-humoured laugh, <div class="bookquote">``don't you be moral!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How have I done what I have done?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver; <div class="bookquote">``how do I do what I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose.
<p/>But it's not worth your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to do, you do.
<p/>You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,'' said Carton. At this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) laughed again, and they both laughed.
<p/>Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,'' pursued Carton, <div class="bookquote">``you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into mine.
<p/>Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris, picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always nowhere.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>You were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose.
<p/>'' '' And whose fault was that?'' <div class="bookquote">``Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. It's a gloomy thing, however, to talk about one's own past, with the day breaking.
<p/>Turn me in some other direction before I go.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,'' said Stryver, holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) glass.
<p/>'' Are you turned in a pleasant direction? '' Apparently not, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) became gloomy again. '' Pretty witness,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) muttered, looking down into his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) glass.
<p/>'' I have had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who's your pretty witness?'' <div class="bookquote">``The picturesque doctor's daughter, Miss Manette.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) pretty?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) not?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, man alive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) was the admiration of the whole Court!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Rot the admiration of the whole Court!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Sydney,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) with sharp eyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) florid face:
<p/>, I rather thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll, and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?''
<p/>Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty? She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) was a golden-haired doll!'' <div class="bookquote">``do you know ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Quick to see what happened!
<p/>If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a yard or two of a man's nose, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can see it without a perspective-glass.
<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) host followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out on the staircase with a candle, to light him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a lifeless desert.
<p/>And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.
<p/>Waste forces within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and a desert all around, this man stood still on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the wilderness before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and perseverance.
<p/>In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sight.
<p/>I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I'll have no more drink; I'll get to bed. '' A moment, and it was gone.
<p/>Climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw himself down in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes on a neglected bed, and its pillow was wet with wasted tears.
<p/>Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own help and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own happiness, sensible of the blight on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and resigning himself to let it eat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away.
<p/>On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lived, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) way to dine with the Doctor.
<p/>After several relapses into business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) life.
<p/>VI. Hundreds of People The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not far from Soho-square. On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in the afternoon, for three reasons of habit.
<p/>Firstly, because, on fine Sundays, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie; secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was accustomed to be with them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) happened to have his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them.
<p/>There was no way through it, and the front windows of the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it.
<p/>There were few buildings then, north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields.
<p/>As a consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom, instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which the peaches ripened in their season.
<p/>The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow, though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness.
<p/>It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.
<p/>A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be found in London. There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and there was.
<p/>The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night.
<p/>In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors.
<p/>Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen.
<p/>Occasionally, a stray workman putting his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a thump from the golden giant.
<p/>These, however, were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.
<p/>Doctor Manette received such patients here as his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) old reputation, and its revival in the floating whispers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) story, brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) scientific knowledge, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments, brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) otherwise into moderate request, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) earned as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) wanted.
<p/>These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts, and notice, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner, on the fine Sunday afternoon.
<p/>Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the fact.
<p/>'' Doctor Manette at home? '' Expected home. '' Miss Lucie at home? '' Expected home. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Pross at home?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Although the Doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) birth, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics.
<p/>Simple as the furniture was, it was set off by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy, that its effect was delightful.
<p/>The disposition of everything in the rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours, the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry stood looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), with something of that peculiar expression which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knew so well by this time, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) approved?
<p/>There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) detected all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), walked from one to another.
<p/>The first was the best room, and in it were Lucie's birds, and flowers, and books, and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was the Doctor's consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third, changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the Doctor's bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker's bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.
<p/>As I am at home myself,'' said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``I'll go upstairs. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' I wonder,'' said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looking about, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) keeps that reminder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sufferings about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose acquaintance he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and had since improved.
<p/>'' And why wonder at that? '' was the abrupt inquiry that made him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) start. '' I should have thought-- '' Mr. Lorry began.
<p/>'' Pooh! You'd have thought!'' said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off. '' How do you do? '' inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to express that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) no malice.
<p/>'' I am pretty well, I thank you,'' answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; <div class="bookquote">``how are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' Nothing to boast of,'' said Miss Pross.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For gracious sake say something else besides `indeed,' or you'll fidget me to death,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross: whose character -LRB-dissociated from stature-RRB- was shortness.
<p/>'' Indeed?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross. '' I am very much put out about my Ladybird.'' <div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Really, then?'' said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.
<p/>'' Really, is bad enough,'' returned Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``but better. Yes, I am very much put out.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>'' May I ask the cause?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to come here looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross.
<p/>It was characteristic of this lady -LRB-as of some other people before her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) time and since-RRB- that whenever her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) original proposition was questioned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) exaggerated it.
<p/>'' Do dozens come for that purpose?'' <div class="bookquote">``Hundreds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross. '' Dear me!'' said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could think of.
<p/>I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and paid me for it; which she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) certainly should never have done, you may take your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) for nothing--since she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was ten years old.
<p/>Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything.
<p/>All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet, are always turning up,'' said Miss Pross.
<p/>'' And it's really very hard,'' said Miss Pross. '' '' When you began it--'' '' I began it, Miss Pross?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you? Who brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) father to life?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh! If that was beginning it--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry. '' It wasn't ending it, I suppose?
<p/>I say, when you began it, it was hard enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any circumstances.
<p/>But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) -LRB-I could have forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)-RRB-, to take Ladybird's affections away from me.
<p/>Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) also knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) by this time to be, beneath the service of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) eccentricity, one of those unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had such an exalted respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stationed Miss Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson's.
<p/>There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,'' said Miss Pross; <div class="bookquote">``and that was my brother Solomon, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) hadn't made a mistake in life.
<p/>Here again: Mr. Lorry's inquiries into Miss Pross's personal history had established the fact that her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) of everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) possessed, as a stake to speculate with, and had abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) poverty for evermore, with no touch of compunction.
<p/>Miss Pross's fidelity of belief in Solomon -LRB-deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake-RRB- was quite a serious matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) good opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>).
<p/>As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had sat down there in friendly relations, <div class="bookquote">``let me ask you--does the Doctor, in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Never.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Pross, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' But I don't say he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) don't refer to it within himself. '' <div class="bookquote">``Do you believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) thinks of it much?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross. '' Do you imagine--'' Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) up short with: <div class="bookquote">``Never imagine anything.
<p/>Have no imagination at all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose, sometimes?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now and then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross.
<p/>Do you suppose,'' Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) bright eye, as it looked kindly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that Doctor Manette has any theory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) own, preserved through all those years, relative to the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) oppressor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And that is--?'' ``That she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) has.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Dull?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>Miss Pross inquired, with placidity. Rather wishing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, <div class="bookquote">``No, no, no. Surely not.
<p/>To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is, should never touch upon that question?
<p/>I will not say with me, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is so devotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)?
<p/>To the best of my understanding, and bad's the best, you'll tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is afraid of the whole subject.
<p/>Believe me, Miss Pross, I don't approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of zealous interest.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Afraid?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' It's plain enough, I should think, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) may be. It's a dreadful remembrance. Besides that, his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) loss of himself grew out of it.
<p/>Not knowing how he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) lost himself, or how he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) recovered himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) may never feel certain of not losing himself again.
<p/>That alone wouldn't make the subject pleasant, I should think. '' It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for.
<p/>Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up within him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).
<p/>'' True,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and fearful to reflect upon. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't be helped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head. '' Touch that string, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone.
<p/>Sometimes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) gets up in the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking up and down, walking up and down, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) room.
<p/>Ladybird has learnt to know then that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) old prison.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) hurries to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), and they go on together, walking up and down, walking up and down, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is composed.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) never says a word of the true reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) restlessness, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) finds it best not to hint at it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).
<p/>In silence they go walking up and down together, walking up and down together, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) love and company have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to himself.
<p/>Notwithstanding Miss Pross's denial of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own imagination, there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) possessing such a thing.
<p/>The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going.
<p/>Here they are!'' said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference; <div class="bookquote">``and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!
<p/>It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window, looking for the father and daughter whose steps he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heard, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fancied they would never approach.
<p/>Not only would the echoes die away, as though the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand.
<p/>In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>'' '' However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them.
<p/>Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) darling's bonnet when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) came up-stairs, and touching it up with the ends of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) rich hair with as much pride as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) could possibly have taken in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own hair if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had been the vainest and handsomest of women.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) darling was a pleasant sight too, embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) and thanking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), and protesting against her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) taking so much trouble for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)--which last she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) only dared to do playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own chamber and cried.
<p/>The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at them, and telling Miss Pross how she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) spoilt Lucie, in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would have had more if it were possible.
<p/>Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too, beaming at all this in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) little wig, and thanking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) bachelor stars for having lighted him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) declining years to a Home.
<p/>But, no Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of Miss Pross's prediction.
<p/>Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and always acquitted herself marvellously.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) dinners, of a very modest quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their contrivances,
<p/>Miss Pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would impart culinary mysteries to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>).
<p/>From these decayed sons and daughters of Gaul, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as quite a Sorceress, or Cinderella's Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit, a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Godmother</b></font>) pleased.
<p/>On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other days persisted in taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) meals at unknown periods, either in the lower regions, or in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to which no one but her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) Ladybird ever gained admittance.
<p/>On this occasion, Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.
<p/>It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit there in the air.
<p/>As everything turned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), and revolved about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), they went out under the plane-tree, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) carried the wine down for the special benefit of Mr. Lorry.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had installed herself, some time before, as Mr. Lorry's cup-bearer; and while they sat under the plane-tree, talking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) glass replenished.
<p/>Mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads.
<p/>half English and half French, that nothing could be better. Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was only One.
<p/>Doctor Manette received him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and retired into the house.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) called it, in familiar conversation, <div class="bookquote">``a fit of the jerks.
<p/>The resemblance between him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as they sat side by side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) shoulder, and he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) resting his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) arm on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) chair, it was very agreeable to trace the likeness.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The Doctor was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) best condition, and looked specially young. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual vivacity.
<p/>Pray, Doctor Manette,'' said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the plane-tree--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand, which happened to be the old buildings of London--<div class="bookquote">``have you seen much of the Tower?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.
<p/>'' I have been there, as you remember,'' said Darnay, with a smile, though reddening a little angrily, <div class="bookquote">``in another character, and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it.
<p/>In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>They told me a curious thing when I was there.'' '' What was that? '' Lucie asked. '' Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers.
<p/>Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to execution, had cut as his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) last work, three letters.
<p/>At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully examined, the last letter was found to be G.
<p/>There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been.
<p/>They were done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand. At length, it was suggested that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG.
<p/>The floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag.
<p/>What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``My father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lucie, <div class="bookquote">``you are ill!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had suddenly started up, with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) manner and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) look quite terrified them all.
<p/>'' No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they made me start. We had better go in.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large drops, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) showed the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand with rain-drops on it.
<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry either detected, or fancied it detected, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) face, as it turned towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in the passages of the Court House.
<p/>The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) stopped under it to remark to them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was not yet proof against slight surprises -LRB-if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) ever would be-RRB-, and that the rain had startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) business eye. Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), and yet no Hundreds of people.
<p/>Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) made only Two. The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and windows open, they were overpowered by heat.
<p/>When the tea-table was done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the heavy twilight.
<p/>The curtains were long and white, and some of the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.
<p/>Lucie sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father; Darnay sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>); Carton leaned against a window. '' The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,'' said Doctor Manette.
<p/>They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.
<p/>There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a footstep was there.
<p/>'' It comes slowly.'' <div class="bookquote">``It comes surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton. '' A multitude of people, and yet a solitude! '' said Darnay, when they had listened for a while.
<p/>Sometimes, I have sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and solemn--
<p/>'' Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay? '' asked Lucie. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Let us shudder too. We may know what it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated.
<p/>I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-bye into our lives.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sydney Carton</b></font>)</div><p/>There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,'' Sydney Carton struck in, in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) moody way.
<p/>The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some, as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in the distant streets, and not one within sight.
<p/>Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or are we to divide them among us?''
<p/>'' The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more rapid. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you asked for it.
<p/>When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life, and my father's.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I take them into mine!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Carton. '' I ask no questions and make no stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette, and I see them--by the Lightning.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) added the last words, after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lounging in the window.
<p/>'' And I hear them! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) added again, after a peal of thunder. '' Here they come, fast, fierce, and furious!
<p/>It was the rush and roar of rain that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) typified, and it stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), for no voice could be heard in it.
<p/>A memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment's interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at midnight.
<p/>The great bell of Saint Paul's was striking one in the cleared air, when Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set forth on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) return-passage to Clerkenwell.
<p/>There were solitary patches of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier.
<p/>'' '' What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,'' said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``to bring the dead out of their graves.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don't expect to--what would do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>answered Jerry. '' Good night, Mr. Carton,'' said the man of business.
<p/>'' Good night, Mr. Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!'' Perhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar, bearing down upon them, too.
<p/>Monseigneur in Town Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) fortnightly reception in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) grand hotel in Paris.
<p/>Monseigneur was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) inner room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without.
<p/>Monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing France; but, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) morning's chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four strong men besides the Cook.
<p/>It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips.
<p/>One lacquey carried the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) bore for that function; a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) of the two gold watches-RRB-, poured the chocolate out.
<p/>It was impossible for Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) high place under the admiring Heavens.
<p/>Deep would have been the blot upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) escutcheon if his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men; he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) must have died of two.
<p/>VII. Monseigneur was about to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) chocolate. Yes. Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented.
<p/>So polite and so impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far more influence with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets, than the needs of all France.
<p/>A happy circumstance for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured!--always was for England -LRB-by way of example-RRB-, in the regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it.
<p/>Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) way--tend to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) own power and pocket.
<p/>Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) pleasures, general and particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world was made for them.
<p/>The text of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) order -LRB-altered from the original by only a pronoun, which is not much-RRB- ran: <div class="bookquote">``The earth and the fulness thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.
<p/>Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) affairs, both private and public; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) had, as to both classes of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General.
<p/>As to finances public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor.
<p/>Hence Monseigneur had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) sister from a convent, while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could wear, and had bestowed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General, poor in family.
<p/>Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) own wife included, looked down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) with the loftiest contempt.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>A man</b></font>)</div>A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) halls, six body-women waited on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<p/>As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) matrimonial relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.
<p/>For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere -LRB-and not so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both-RRB-, they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have been anybody's business, at the house of Monseigneur.
<p/>Military officers destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship; civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives; all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the score.
<p/>People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State, yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were no less abundant.
<p/>Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur.
<p/>Projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur.
<p/>Unbelieving Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur.
<p/>Exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur.
<p/>Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) manners and appearance, owned to being a Mother.
<p/>Indeed, except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing known to the fashion.
<p/>Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close, and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty.
<p/>In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong.
<p/>As a promising way of setting them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the Future, for Monseigneur's guidance.
<p/>Besides these Dervishes, were other three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a jargon about <div class="bookquote">``the Centre of Truth:''  (<font color='red'><b>these Dervishes</b></font>)</div>holding that Man had got out of the Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got out of the Circumference, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was to be kept from flying out of the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre, by fasting and seeing of spirits.
<p/>The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur. Among these, accordingly, much discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never became manifest.
<p/>If the Day of Judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally correct.
<p/>Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would surely keep anything going, for ever and ever.
<p/>The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells; and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) devouring hunger far away.
<p/>But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places.
<p/>From the Palace of the Tuileries, through Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals of Justice, and all society -LRB-except the scarecrows-RRB-, the Fancy Ball descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was required to officiate <div class="bookquote">``frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps, and white silk stockings.
<p/>At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his (<font color='blue'><b>Executioner</b></font>) brother Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Executioner</b></font>), presided in this dainty dress.
<p/>And who among the company at Monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see the very stars out!
<p/>Monseigneur having eased his (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) four men of their burdens and taken his (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown open, and issued forth.
<p/>Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Executioner</b></font>)</div>Then, what submission, what cringing and fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation!
<p/>As to bowing down in body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never troubled it.
<p/>Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of Truth.
<p/>There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) sanctuary by the chocolate sprites, and was seen no more.
<p/>The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm, and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs.
<p/>There was soon but one person left of all the crowd, and he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) hat under his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) arm and his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) snuff-box in his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) way out.
<p/>I devote you,'' said this person, stopping at the last door on his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) way, and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, <div class="bookquote">``to the Devil!
<p/>With that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) shook the snuff from his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) fingers as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) had shaken the dust from his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) feet, and quietly walked downstairs.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>this person</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask.
<p/>A face of a transparent paleness; every feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose, beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril.
<p/>They persisted in changing colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance.
<p/>Examined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a handsome face, and a remarkable one.
<p/>In those two compressions, or dints, the only little change that the face ever showed, resided. Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) carriage, and drove away.
<p/>Not many people had talked with him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) at the reception; he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer in his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) manner.
<p/>It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) to see the common people dispersed before his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) horses, and often barely escaping from being run down.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) man drove as if he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) were charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face, or to the lips, of the master.
<p/>The complaint had sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age, that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner.
<p/>But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could.
<p/>the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way.
<p/>At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.
<p/>But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded behind, and why not?
<p/>With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days, But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry, and there were twenty hands at the horses' bridles.
<p/>A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.
<p/>'' What has gone wrong?'' said Monsieur, calmly looking out. '' Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!'' said a ragged and submissive man, <div class="bookquote">``it is a child.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man child</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) make that abominable noise? Is it his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) child?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes. ''
<p/>The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square.
<p/>As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hand for an instant on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) sword-hilt.
<p/>'' Killed! '' shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger.
<p/>'' Dead!'' The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so.
<p/>Monsieur the Marquis ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.
<p/>The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) purse.
<p/>'' It is extraordinary to me,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell.
<p/>How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, <div class="bookquote">``Dead!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>On seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), the miserable creature fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest made way. They were as silent, however, as the men.
<p/>'' I know all, I know all,'' said the last comer. '' Be a brave man, my Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live.
<p/>It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour as happily?'' '' You are a philosopher, you there,'' said the Marquis, smiling.
<p/>'' How do they call you?'' '' They call me Defarge.'' '' Of what trade?'' <div class="bookquote">``Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, throwing him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) another gold coin, <div class="bookquote">``and spend it as you will.
<p/>Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the Marquis leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) seat, and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) carriage, and ringing on its floor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face on the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was the figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.
<p/>You dogs!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front, except as to the spots on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) nose: <div class="bookquote">``I would ride over any of you very willingly, and exterminate you from the earth.
<p/>If I knew which rascal threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he (<font color='blue'><b>brigand</b></font>) should be crushed under the wheels.
<p/>The horses there; are they right? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hold!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur the Marquis. '' Hold the horses! Who threw that?'' '' ''
<p/>So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised.
<p/>Among the men, not one. But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the Marquis in the face.
<p/>It was not for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) dignity to notice it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) contemptuous eyes passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and over all the other rats; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) seat again, and gave the word <div class="bookquote">``Go on!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by.
<p/>The rats had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through which they peeped.
<p/>The father had long ago taken up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bundle and bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness of Fate.
<p/>The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule, time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all things ran their course.
<p/>Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat.
<p/>On inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away.
<p/>Monsieur the Marquis in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) travelling carriage -LRB-which might have been lighter-RRB-, conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up a steep hill.
<p/>A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) high breeding; it was not from within; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) control--the setting sun.
<p/>The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson.
<p/>VIII. Monseigneur in the Country A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant. '' It will die out,'' said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``directly.
<p/>When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow left when the drag was taken off.
<p/>But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison.
<p/>Round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was coming near home.
<p/>The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor fountain, all usual poor appointments.
<p/>All its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors, shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten.
<p/>Expressive signs of what made them poor, were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. It had its poor people too. Few children were to be seen, and no dogs.
<p/>As to the men and women, their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill; or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.
<p/>Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) postilions' whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) travelling carriage at the posting-house gate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years.
<p/>Monsieur the Marquis cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), as the like of himself had drooped before Monseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group.
<p/>It was hard by the fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Bring me hither that fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis to the courier.
<p/>The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.
<p/>'' I passed you on the road?'' '' Monseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the road.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Monseigneur, it is true.'' <div class="bookquote">``What did you look at, so fixedly?''

''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stooped a little, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage.
<p/>All his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellows stooped to look under the carriage. '' What man, pig? And why look there?'' <div class="bookquote">``Pardon, Monseigneur; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''  (<font color='red'><b>the traveller</b></font>)</div>demanded the traveller. '' Monseigneur, the man.'' <div class="bookquote">``May the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man?
<p/>You know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Your clemency, Monseigneur! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not of this part of the country.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face thrown up to the sky, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head hanging down; then recovered himself, fumbled with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cap, and made a bow.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head hanging over--like this!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' What was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like?'' '' Monseigneur, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!''
<p/>The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur the Marquis.
<p/>Truly, you did well,'' said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to see a thief accompanying my carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours.
<p/>Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary united; he (<font color='blue'><b>Postmaster</b></font>) had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Postmaster</b></font>) arm in an official manner.

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?''  (<font color='red'><b>some friends</b></font>)</div>The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends, pointing out the chain with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) blue cap.
<p/>Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?'' <div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as a person plunges into the river.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Some friends</b></font>)</div><p/>Some half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out, and presented him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breathless to Monsieur the Marquis. '' <div class="bookquote">``See to it, Gabelle.
<p/>The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or they might not have been so fortunate.
<p/>The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill.
<p/>Go on! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Gradually, it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night.
<p/>The postilions, with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance.
<p/>At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground, with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) had studied the figure from the life--his (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) own life, maybe--for it was dreadfully spare and thin.
<p/>To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head as the carriage came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), rose quickly, and presented herself at the carriage-door. '' It is you, Monseigneur!
<p/>Monseigneur, a petition. '' With an exclamation of impatience, but with his (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) unchangeable face, Monseigneur looked out. '' How, then! What is it?
<p/>Always petitions!'' <div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What of your husband, the forester?
<p/>Always the same with you people. He (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) cannot pay something?''

He (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) is dead.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well! He (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) is quiet.
<p/>Can I restore him (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Alas, no, Monseigneur! But he (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) lies yonder, under a little heap of poor grass.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Again, well? ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) looked an old woman, but was young.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) manner was one of passionate grief; by turns she (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly, caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to feel the appealing touch.
<p/>'' Monseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.''
<p/>My petition is, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband's name, may be placed over him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to show where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lies.
<p/>Otherwise, the place will be quickly forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass.
<p/>'' Again, well? Can I feed them?'' <div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don't ask it. Monseigneur, they are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want.
<p/>The valet had put her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) away from the door, the carriage had broken into a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was left far behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) chateau.
<p/>The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>), and rose, as the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid of the blue cap without which he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) was nothing, still enlarged upon his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it.
<p/>By degrees, as they could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished.
<p/>The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees, was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) carriage stopped, and the great door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) chateau was opened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>).
<p/>Monseigneur! Monseigneur! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Monsieur Charles</b></font>)</div>'' Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arrived from England?'' <div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur, not yet. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>IX. The Gorgon's Head
<p/>It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door.
<p/>A stony business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in all directions.
<p/>Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau preceded, went from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees.
<p/>All else was so quiet, that the flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being in the open night-air.
<p/>Other sound than the owl's voice there was none, save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.
<p/>The great door clanged behind him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase; grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a peasant, gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) lord was angry.
<p/>Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night, Monsieur the Marquis, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) flambeau-bearer going on before, went up the staircase to a door in a corridor.
<p/>As if the Gorgon's head had surveyed it, when it was finished, two centuries ago. This thrown open, admitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own private apartment of three rooms: his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) bed-chamber and two others.
<p/>High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country.
<p/>The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to break--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture; but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of France.
<p/>A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round room, in one of the chateau's four extinguisher-topped towers.
<p/>A small lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.
<p/>'' My nephew,'' said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; <div class="bookquote">``they said he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was not arrived. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>); but, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had been expected with Monseigneur.
<p/>'' Ah! It is not probable he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) chair was opposite to the window, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) soup, and was raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) glass of Bordeaux to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) lips, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) put it down.
<p/>'' In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) sumptuous and choice supper. ''
<p/>What is that?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) calmly asked, looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour. <div class="bookquote">``Monseigneur? That?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Outside the blinds.
<p/>Open the blinds. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was done. '' Well?'' '' Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are here.
<p/>The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), looking round for instructions.
<p/>'' '' Good,'' said the imperturbable master. '' Close them again. '' That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) supper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) was half way through it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) again stopped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hand, hearing the sound of wheels.
<p/>It came on briskly, and came up to the front of the chateau. '' Ask who is arrived. '' It was the nephew of Monseigneur.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had been some few leagues behind Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had diminished the distance rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was to be told -LRB-said Monseigneur-RRB- that supper awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) then and there, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was prayed to come to it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>). In a little while he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) came. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had been known in England as Charles Darnay.
<p/>Monseigneur received him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in a courtly manner, but they did not shake hands. '' You left Paris yesterday, sir?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) said to Monseigneur, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) seat at table.
<p/>'' Yesterday. And you? '' <div class="bookquote">``I come direct.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``From London?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>'' You have been a long time coming,'' said the Marquis, with a smile.
<p/>'' On the contrary; I come direct.'' <div class="bookquote">``Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time intending the journey.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have been detained by'' (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>--the nephew stopped a moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) answer--<div class="bookquote">``various business. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Without doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the polished uncle.
<p/>When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew, looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask, opened a conversation.
<p/>So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them. '' I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that took me away.
<p/>It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>returned the nephew, <div class="bookquote">``whether, if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.
<p/>The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring.
<p/>Indeed, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>pursued the nephew, <div class="bookquote">``for anything I know, you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Not to death,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle; <div class="bookquote">``it is not necessary to say, to death.''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``No, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle, pleasantly.
<p/>But, however that may be,'' resumed the nephew, glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) with deep distrust, <div class="bookquote">``I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means, and would know no scruple as to means.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``My friend, I told you so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the two marks. '' Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I recall it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical instrument.
<p/>In effect, sir,'' pursued the nephew, ``I believe it to be at once your bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in France here.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I do not quite understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>returned the uncle, sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) coffee. '' Dare I ask you to explain?'' ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle, with great calmness. '' For the honour of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>observed the nephew.
<p/>Pray excuse me!'' '' I would not say happily, my friend,'' returned the uncle, with refined politeness; <div class="bookquote">``I would not be sure of that.
<p/>A good opportunity for consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself.
<p/>These little instruments of correction, these gentle aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity.
<p/>But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say, at a disadvantage. They are sought by so many, and they are granted -LRB-comparatively-RRB- to so few!
<p/>It used not to be so, but France in all such things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar.
<p/>From this room, many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room -LRB-my bedroom-RRB-, one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) daughter-- his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) daughter?
<p/>We have lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the assertion of our station, in these days, might -LRB-I do not go so far as to say would, but might-RRB- cause us real inconvenience.
<p/>The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) head; as elegantly despondent as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) could becomingly be of a country still containing himself, that great means of regeneration.
<p/>We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern time also,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the nephew, gloomily, <div class="bookquote">``that I believe our name to be more detested than any name in France.
<p/>All very bad, very bad! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Let us hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>said the uncle. '' Detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low.''
<p/>There is not,'' pursued the nephew, in his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) former tone, <div class="bookquote">``a face I can look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A compliment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, <div class="bookquote">``to the grandeur of the family, merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.
<p/>But, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hand, the fine mask looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of indifference.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Hah! '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) legs. '' Repression is the only lasting philosophy.
<p/>The dark deference of fear and slavery, my friend,'' observed the Marquis, <div class="bookquote">``will keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>looking up to it, <div class="bookquote">``shuts out the sky.
<p/>If a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) that night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) might have been at a loss to claim his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own from the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains.
<p/>As for the roof he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) vaunted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) might have found that shutting out the sky in a new way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. '' Meanwhile,'' said the Marquis, <div class="bookquote">``I will preserve the honour and repose of the family, if you will not.
<p/>But you must be fatigued. Shall we terminate our conference for the night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A moment more. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' An hour, if you please.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>said the nephew, <div class="bookquote">``we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits of wrong. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div>'' We have done wrong?
<p/>'' repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile, and delicately pointing, first to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) nephew, then to himself. '' Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account to both of us, in such different ways.
<p/>Even in my father's time, we did a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure, whatever it was.
<p/>Why need I speak of my father's time, when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father's twin-brother, joint inheritor, and next successor, from himself?''
<p/>And has left me,'' answered the nephew, <div class="bookquote">``bound to a system that is frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last look of my dear mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seeking them from me, my nephew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) on the breast with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--``you will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.
<p/>Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) face, was cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) stood looking quietly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) nephew, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) snuff-box in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Once again he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) on the breast, as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) finger were the fine point of a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) ran him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) through the body, and said, ``My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have lived.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Death has done that!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis. '' '' '' When he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had said it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) box in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>Better to be a rational creature,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) added then, after ringing a small bell on the table, <div class="bookquote">``and accept your natural destiny.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But you are lost, Monsieur Charles, I see.'' '' This property and France are lost to me,'' said the nephew, sadly; <div class="bookquote">``I renounce them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>''--or twenty years hence--'' '' You do me too much honour,'' said the Marquis; <div class="bookquote">``still, I prefer that supposition.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>''--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere.
<p/>It is little to relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!'' <div class="bookquote">``Hah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.
<p/>To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and suffering.''
<p/>If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly -LRB-if such a thing is possible-RRB- from the weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Hah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner. '' There is a curse on it, and on all this land.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at their backs, may have to do some day--work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And you?'' said the uncle. '' Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new philosophy, graciously intend to live?'' <div class="bookquote">``In England, for example?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.
<p/>'' The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication.
<p/>England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have prospered there,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) observed then, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) calm face to his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) nephew with a smile.
<p/>The Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) valet. '' '' I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may be indebted to you, sir.
<p/>For the rest, it is my Refuge.'' '' They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there?
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>compatriot</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>compatriot</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>compatriot</b></font>) most courtly manner, there was a secrecy in his (<font color='blue'><b>compatriot</b></font>) smiling face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>compatriot</b></font>) conveyed an air of mystery to those words, which struck the eyes and ears of his (<font color='blue'><b>compatriot</b></font>) nephew forcibly.
<p/>At the same time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic.
<p/>A Doctor?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With a daughter?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Marquis</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' said the Marquis. '' You are fatigued. Good night! '' '' Yes,'' repeated the Marquis.
<p/>It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>).
<p/>'' A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night! '' The nephew looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>), in vain, in passing on to the door.
<p/>'' Good night!'' said the uncle. '' I look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning. Good repose!
<p/>Light Monsieur my nephew to his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) bed, if you will,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) added to himself, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) rang his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) little bell again, and summoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) valet to his (<font color='blue'><b>Monsieur</b></font>) own bedroom.
<p/>The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still night.
<p/>Rustling about the room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) softly-slippered feet making no noise on the floor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just coming on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) moved from end to end of his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) mind; the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at the fountain, and the mender of roads with his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage.
<p/>That fountain suggested the Paris fountain, the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the tall man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms up, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Dead!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thin gauze curtains fall around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) composed himself to sleep.
<p/>The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by men-poets.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am cool now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Monsieur the Marquis, <div class="bookquote">``and may go to bed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquis/Monsieur the Marquis/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them.
<p/>Dead darkness lay on all the landscape, dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.
<p/>The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might have come down, for anything that could be seen of it.
<p/>For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human, stared blindly at the night. In the village, taxers and taxed were fast asleep.
<p/>Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and freed.
<p/>The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark hours.
<p/>Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light, and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.
<p/>Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees, and poured its radiance over the hill.
<p/>The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.
<p/>In the glow, the water of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces crimsoned. At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.
<p/>Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air.
<p/>Some, to the fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside.
<p/>In the church and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot.
<p/>Then began the rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population. The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and surely.
<p/>First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine; now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.
<p/>Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?
<p/>What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) day's dinner -LRB-not much to carry-RRB- lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to peck at, on a heap of stones?
<p/>All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the return of morning. Had the birds, carrying some grains of it to a distance, dropped one over him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) as they sow chance seeds?
<p/>Whether or no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) life, down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) got to the fountain.
<p/>All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise.
<p/>The led cows, hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter.
<p/>Some of the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly fraught with nothing.
<p/>Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself in the breast with his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) blue cap.
<p/>What did all this portend, and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle -LRB-double-laden though the horse was-RRB-, at a gallop, like a new version of the German ballad of Leonora?
<p/>The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years.
<p/>It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau. It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis.
<p/>It was like a fine mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife.
<p/>Round its hilt was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled: <div class="bookquote">``Drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) fast to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) tomb. This, from Jacques.
<p/>More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French language who was conversant with French literature.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>X.</b></font>)</div>X. Two Promises In this age, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) would have been a Professor; in that age, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was a Tutor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) could write of them, besides, in sound English, and render them into sound English.
<p/>Such masters were not at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had dropped out of Tellson's ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters.
<p/>As a tutor, whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became known and encouraged.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was well acquainted, more-over, with the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) country, and those were of ever-growing interest. So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) prospered.
<p/>In London, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor to lie on beds of roses; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had had any such exalted expectation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) would not have prospered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had expected labour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) found it, and did it and made the best of it. In this, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) prosperity consisted.
<p/>A certain portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) time was passed at Cambridge, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek and Latin through the Custom-house.
<p/>Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay's way--the way of the love of a woman.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) compassionate voice; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was confronted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).
<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had not yet spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on the subject; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long, long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had never yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) heart.
<p/>The rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) time he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) passed in London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) danger. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) reasons for this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) knew full well.
<p/>It was again a summer day when, lately arrived in London from his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) college occupation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) mind to Doctor Manette.
<p/>It was the close of the summer day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) found the Doctor reading in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) arm-chair at a window.
<p/>The energy which had at once supported him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) recovered energy he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had at first been in the exercise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) other recovered faculties; but, this had never been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength of resolution, and vigour of action. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease, and was equably cheerful.
<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), now entered Charles Darnay, at sight of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) laid aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) book and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) hand. ``Charles Darnay!
<p/>I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. ''
<p/>'' Miss Manette--'' <div class="bookquote">``Is well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manette/Miss Manette</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stopped short, <div class="bookquote">``and your return will delight us all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doctor Manette, I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) was from home. I took the opportunity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) being from home, to beg to speak to you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a blank silence. '' Yes?'' said the Doctor, with evident constraint. <div class="bookquote">``Bring your chair here, and speak on.
<p/>I have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>so he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) at length began, <div class="bookquote">``for some year and a half, that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy. '' not--'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had kept it so a little while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said, drawing it back: <div class="bookquote">``Is Lucie the topic? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hard for me to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) at any time. It is very hard for me to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said deferentially. There was another blank silence before her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father rejoined: <div class="bookquote">``I believe it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles Darnay hesitated.
<p/>I do you justice; I believe it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>'' Shall I go on, sir?'' Another blank. '' Yes, go on. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden.
<p/>Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly, disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>).
<p/>You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me! ''  (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div>The Doctor sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face turned away, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes bent on the ground.
<p/>At the last words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand again, hurriedly, and cried: <div class="bookquote">``Not that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnay's ears long after he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had ceased.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) motioned with the hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter so received it, and remained silent.
<p/>'' I ask your pardon,'' said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some moments. '' I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) chair, but did not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), or raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) chin dropped upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) white hair overshadowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face: ``Have you spoken to Lucie?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father.

(<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father thanks you. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) offered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand; but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes did not go with it.
<p/>I know,'' said Darnay, respectfully, <div class="bookquote">``how can I fail to know, Doctor Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child.
<p/>I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there is, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy itself.
<p/>I know that, as in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) childhood she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no parent, so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) present years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from the world beyond this life, you could hardly be invested, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sight, with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>I know that when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is clinging to you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your neck.
<p/>I know that in loving you she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sees and loves her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother broken-hearted,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.
<p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father sat silent, with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face bent down. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) breathing was a little quickened; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) repressed all other signs of agitation.
<p/>Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) and you with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as long as it was in the nature of man to do it.
<p/>I have felt, and do even now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself.
<p/>'' But I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>). Heaven is my witness that I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)!'' <div class="bookquote">``I believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father, mournfully. ''
<p/>But, do not believe,'' said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a reproachful sound, <div class="bookquote">``that if my fortune were so cast as that, being one day so happy as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) my wife, I must at any time put any separation between her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) and you, I could or would breathe a word of what I now say.
<p/>I have thought so before now. I believe it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>'' Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I should know it to be a baseness.
<p/>If I had any such possibility, even at a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not now touch this honoured hand.
<p/>Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your life and home, and being faithful to you to the death.
<p/>Not to divide with Lucie her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to come in aid of it, and bind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) closer to you, if such a thing can be.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own upon it as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke. '' No, dear Doctor Manette. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) touch still lingered on her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father's hand.
<p/>Answering the touch for a moment, but not coldly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father rested his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands upon the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference.
<p/>A struggle was evidently in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face; a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.
<p/>You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so.
<p/>'' Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?'' <div class="bookquote">``None. As yet, none. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks ; I might -LRB-mistaken or not mistaken-RRB- have that hopefulness to-morrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But I have thought it possible that you might have it in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you seek any guidance from me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I ask none, sir.

<p/>I well understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' What is it?'' '' I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. --I could retain no place in it against her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand equally well, that a word from her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father in any suitor's favour, would outweigh herself and all the world.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?'' For which reason, Doctor Manette,'' said Darnay, modestly but firmly, <div class="bookquote">``I would not ask that word, to save my life.
<p/>Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate.
<p/>My daughter Lucie is, in this one respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) heart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I am sure of it.

<p/>'' Is sought by any other suitor?'' '' It is what I meant to say. '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father considered a little before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself.
<p/>Mr. Stryver is here too, occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Or both,'' said Darnay.
<p/>'' I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want a promise from me. Tell me what it is.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) own part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it.
<p/>I hope you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask.
<p/>The condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to require, I will observe immediately.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I give the promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, <div class="bookquote">``without any condition.
<p/>I believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties between me and my other and far dearer self.
<p/>I believe your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. If she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) should ever tell me that you are essential to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) perfect happiness, I will give her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to you.
<p/>If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>The young man had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand gratefully; their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke: ''--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) really loved--the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head--they should all be obliterated for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sake.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me than wrong, more to me-- Well! This is idle talk.
<p/>So strange was the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faded into silence, and so strange his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fixed look when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.
<p/>'' '' You said something to me,'' said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile. '' What was it you said to me?
<p/>Relieved as his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mind reverted to that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was at a loss how to answer, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) remembered having spoken of a condition.

<p/>I wish to tell you what that is, and why I am in England.'' <div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor of Beauvais. ''
<p/>For an instant, the Doctor even had his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) two hands at his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) ears; for another instant, even had his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) two hands laid on Darnay's lips.
<p/>I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no secret from you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell me when I ask you, not now.

She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) will be home directly, and it is better she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) should not see us together to-night.
<p/>Go! God bless you! '' It was dark when Charles Darnay left him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), and it was an hour later and darker when Lucie came home
<p/>; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hurried into the room alone--for Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) reading-chair empty. ''
<p/>My father! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). '' Father dear!'' Nothing was said in answer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) heard a low hammering sound in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) bedroom.
<p/>Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) looked in at his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) blood all chilled, <div class="bookquote">``What shall I do!
<p/>What shall I do! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) uncertainty lasted but a moment; she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) hurried back, and tapped at his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) door, and softly called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>The noise ceased at the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) voice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) presently came out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), and they walked up and down together for a long time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) came down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) bed, to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sleep that night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) slept heavily, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) tray of shoemaking tools, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) old unfinished work, were all as usual.
<p/>A Companion Picture <div class="bookquote">``Sydney,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) jackal; <div class="bookquote">``mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.
<p/>Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before, and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver's papers before the setting in of the long vacation.
<p/>The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and bring grist to the mill again.
<p/>It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was in a very damaged condition, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) now pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) turban off and threw it into the basin in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours.
<p/>Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?''  (<font color='red'><b>jackal</b></font>)</div>said Stryver the portly, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) back.

<p/>'' Well then, I'll tell you,'' said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting posture. '' Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you, because you are such an insensible dog.

<p/>No; but before I go on,'' said Stryver, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) bullying way, <div class="bookquote">``I'll have this out with you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>You've been at Doctor Manette's house as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your moroseness there!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to be ashamed of anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Sydney; <div class="bookquote">``you ought to be much obliged to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>You shall not get off in that way,'' rejoined Stryver, shouldering the rejoinder at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``no, Sydney, it's my duty to tell you--and I tell you to your face to do you good
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned fellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow. '' Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had made, and laughed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, squaring himself; <div class="bookquote">``I have less need to make myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances.
<p/>Why do I do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never saw you do it yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>muttered Carton. '' I do it because it's politic; I do it on principle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Carton, with a careless air; <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would keep to that.
<p/>And look at me! I get on.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>As to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked the question with some appearance of scorn.
<p/>'' You have no business to be incorrigible,'' was his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) friend's answer, delivered in no very soothing tone. '' I have no business to be, at all, that I know of,'' said Sydney Carton.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, don't let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable, Sydney,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver, preparing him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) with ostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was about to make, <div class="bookquote">``because I know you don't mean half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Who is the lady?'' I make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms.''
<p/>Certainly; and in these chambers.'' Sydney Carton looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) punch and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) complacent friend; drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) punch and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) complacent friend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>'' '' You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The young lady is Miss Manette.
<p/>If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.
<p/>You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man's opinion of a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music of mine, who had no ear for music.
<p/>'' Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend. '' Now you know all about it, Syd,'' said Mr. Stryver.
<p/>I don't care about fortune: she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to please myself: on the whole
<p/>She will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man, and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is worthy of good fortune.
<p/>'' , I think I can afford to please myself. Are you astonished? '' Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, <div class="bookquote">``Why should I be astonished?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend Stryver, ``you take it more easily than I fancied you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will.
<p/>Yes, Sydney, I have had enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feels inclined to go to it -LRB-when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can stay away-RRB-, and I feel that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me credit.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You approve?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, <div class="bookquote">``Why should I not approve?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to say a word to you about your prospects.
<p/>You don't know the value of money, you live hard, you'll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor; you really ought to think about a nurse.
<p/>The prosperous patronage with which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said it, made him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) look twice as big as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was, and four times as offensive.
<p/>You are in a bad way, you know; you really are in a bad way. '' '' Now, let me recommend you,'' pursued Stryver, <div class="bookquote">``to look it in the face.
<p/>I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face, you, in your different way.
<p/>Marry. Provide somebody to take care of you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women's society, nor understanding of it, nor tact for it.
<p/>Find out some respectable woman with a little property--somebody in the landlady way, or lodging-letting way--and marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), against a rainy day.
<p/>Find out somebody. That's the kind of thing for you . Now think of it, Sydney.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sydney.
<p/>The Fellow of Delicacy Mr. Stryver having made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) happiness known to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) left town for the Long Vacation.
<p/>After some mental debating of the point, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) should give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand a week or two before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it and Hilary.
<p/>As to the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had not a doubt about it, but clearly saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) way to the verdict.
<p/>XII. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly grounds-- the only grounds ever worth taking into account --it was a plain case, and had not a weak spot in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) called himself for the plaintiff, there was no getting over his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) evidence, the counsel for the defendant threw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) brief, and the jury did not even turn to consider.
<p/>Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) to present himself in Soho, and there declare his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) noble mind.
<p/>Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) way from the Temple, while the bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon it.
<p/>Anybody who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) projecting himself into Soho while he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was yet on Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) full-blown way along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have seen how safe and strong he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) way taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) past Tellson's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) both banking at Tellson's and knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr. Stryver's mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness of the Soho horizon.
<p/>So, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr. Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron bars to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything under the clouds were a sum.
<p/>After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer case could be. <div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver. '' How do you do?
<p/>I hope you are well! '' It was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) always seemed too big for any place, or space.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) squeezed them against the wall.
<p/>The House itself, magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.
<p/>The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would recommend under the circumstances, <div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mr. Stryver?
<p/>There was a peculiarity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air.
<p/>How do you do, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and shook hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) shook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and
<p/>Co. '' Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver? '' asked Mr. Lorry, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) business character. '' Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I have come for a private word.''
<p/>'' Oh indeed!'' said Mr. Lorry, bending down his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) ear, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eye strayed to the House afar off. '' I am going,'' said Mr. Stryver, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) arms confidentially on the desk:
<p/>whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh dear me! '' cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) chin, and looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) visitor dubiously. '' Oh dear me, sir?
<p/>My meaning,'' answered the man of business, <div class="bookquote">``is, of course, friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short, my meaning is everything you could desire.
<p/>But--really, you know, Mr. Stryver--''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in the oddest manner, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) were compelled against his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) will to add, internally, ''
<p/>'' repeated Stryver, drawing back. '' Oh dear you, sir? What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?'' '' you know there really is so much too much of you!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, slapping the desk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) contentious hand, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) eyes wider, and taking a long breath, <div class="bookquote">``if I understand you, Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!
<p/>Mr. Lorry adjusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) little wig at both ears as a means towards that end, and bit the feather of a pen.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>'' D--n it all, sir! '' said Stryver, staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``am I not eligible?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Oh dear yes! Yes.
<p/>Oh yes, you're eligible!'' said Mr. Lorry. '' If you say eligible, you are eligible.'' <div class="bookquote">``Am I not prosperous? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>asked Stryver.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you come to advancing you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be able to make another admission, <div class="bookquote">``nobody can doubt that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,'' said Mr. Lorry. '' And advancing?'' <div class="bookquote">``Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>demanded Stryver, perceptibly crestfallen. '' Well! I--Were you going there now?'' asked Mr. Lorry. '' Straight!'' said Stryver, with a plump of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) fist on the desk.
<p/>'' Then I think I wouldn't, if I was you. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver. '' Now, I'll put you in a corner,'' forensically shaking a forefinger at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>).
<p/>'' You are a man of business and bound to have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn't you go?'' ''
<p/>Because,'' said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``D--n me ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>cried Stryver, <div class="bookquote">``but this beats everything. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry Stryver.
<p/>Here's a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience-- in a Bank,'' said Stryver; <div class="bookquote">``and having summed up three leading reasons for complete success, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) says there's no reason at all!
<p/>Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had said it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) head off.
<p/>When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>Says it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) head on!'' '' The young lady, my good sir,'' said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, <div class="bookquote">``the young lady.
<p/>Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, squaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) elbows, <div class="bookquote">``that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing Fool?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,'' said Mr. Lorry, reddening, <div class="bookquote">``that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk,
<p/>The young lady goes before all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Not exactly so. not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a piece of my mind.
<p/>The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) turn to be angry; Mr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in no better state now it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) turn.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' That is what I mean to tell you, sir,'' said Mr. Lorry. '' Pray let there be no mistake about it.
<p/>Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood hitting a tune out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) teeth with it, which probably gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) the toothache.
<p/>You deliberately advise me not to go up to Soho and offer myself-- my self, Stryver of the King's Bench bar?''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) broke the awkward silence by saying: ``This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. <div class="bookquote">``Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And all I can say of it is,'' laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, <div class="bookquote">``that this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Now understand me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Lorry.
<p/>As a man of business, I am not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of business, I know nothing of it.
<p/>But, as an old fellow, who has carried Miss Manette in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have spoken.
<p/>'' The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I may not be right?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, whistling.
<p/>'' I can't undertake to find third parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And understand me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, <div class="bookquote">``I will not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing.
<p/>It's new to me, but you are right , I dare say. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' '' There! I beg your pardon!'' said Stryver.
<p/>might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you.
<p/>'' Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with the family.
<p/>If you please, committing you in no way, representing you in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it.
<p/>If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is best spared.
<p/>What do you say?'' <div class="bookquote">``How long would you keep me in town?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! It is only a question of a few hours.
<p/>I could go to Soho in the evening, and come to your chambers afterwards. '' '' Then I say yes,'' said Stryver:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't go up there now, I am not so hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look in to-night.
<p/>Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a concussion of air on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) passage through, that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks.
<p/>Those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in.
<p/>The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty.
<p/>And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Stryver, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, <div class="bookquote">``my way out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.
<p/>Good morning. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Temple Bar/Temple</b></font>)</div>Unprepared as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was for the large pill he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had to swallow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) got it down. '' ''
<p/>It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) found great relief. '' You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,'' said Mr. Stryver; <div class="bookquote">``I'll do that for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><p/>Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock, Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) mind than the subject of the morning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) even showed surprise when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) saw Mr. Lorry, and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state. '' Well!'' said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of bootless attempts to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>emissary</b></font>) round to the question.
<p/>'' I have been to Soho. '' <div class="bookquote">``To Soho?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. '' Oh, to be sure! What am I thinking of!''
<p/>'' And I have no doubt,'' said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``that I was right in the conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my advice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, <div class="bookquote">``that I am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father's account.
<p/>I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let us say no more about it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry.
<p/>'' I dare say not,'' rejoined Stryver, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) head in a smoothing and final way; <div class="bookquote">``no matter, no matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is done.
<p/>But it does matter,'' Mr. Lorry urged. '' No it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before.
<p/>In an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could have gained nothing by it.
<p/>I have not proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to that extent.
<p/>Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you will always be disappointed.
<p/>There is no harm at all done. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you, I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.
<p/>And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you, and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do; you were right, it never would have done.
<p/>Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked quite stupidly at Mr. Stryver shouldering him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) towards the door, with an appearance of showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) erring head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make the best of it, my dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver; <div class="bookquote">``say no more about it; thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was. Mr. Stryver was lying back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) sofa, winking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) ceiling.
<p/>XIII. The Fellow of No Delicacy If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) certainly never shone in the house of Doctor Manette.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) cared to talk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing, which overshadowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely pierced by the light within him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).
<p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) did care something for the streets that environed that house, and for the senseless stones that made their pavements.
<p/>Many a night he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>); many a dreary daybreak revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) solitary figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) more scantily than ever; and often when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had got up again, and haunted that neighbourhood.
<p/>On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver -LRB-after notifying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) jackal that <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had thought better of that marrying matter'' (<font color='red'><b>jackal</b></font>)</div>-RRB- had carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney's feet still trod those stones.
<p/>From being irresolute and purposeless, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) feet became animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention, they took him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) to the Doctor's door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had been there often, during a whole year, and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) work, alone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had never been quite at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) ease with him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), and received him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) with some little embarrassment as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) seated himself near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) table.
<p/>But, looking up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) observed a change in it. ''
<p/>I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!'' '' No. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health.
<p/>What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?'' <div class="bookquote">``Is it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to live no better life?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows it is a shame!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then why not change it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Looking gently at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>There were tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) voice too, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am.
<p/>I shall sink lower, and be worse. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) leaned an elbow on her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) table, and covered his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand.
<p/>The table trembled in the silence that followed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) softened, and was much distressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) to be so, without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>), and said: <div class="bookquote">``Pray forgive me, Miss Manette.
<p/>If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier, it would make me very glad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>I break down before the knowledge of what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?'' '' <div class="bookquote">``God bless you for your sweet compassion!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) unshaded his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face after a little while, and spoke steadily. '' Don't be afraid to hear me. Don't shrink from anything I say.
<p/>I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I am like one who died young. All my life might have been. '' '' No, Mr. Carton. She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) was pale and trembling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden.
<p/>If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken, poor creature of misuse as you know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been conscious this day and hour, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happiness, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you, disgrace you, pull you down with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>I know very well that you can have no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot be.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall you--forgive me again!--to a better course? Can I in no way repay your confidence?
<p/>I know this is a confidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) modestly said, after a little hesitation, and in earnest tears, <div class="bookquote">``I know you would say this to no one else.
<p/>Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) head. '' To none. No, Miss Manette, to none.
<p/>If you will hear me through a very little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul.
<p/>In my degradation I have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had died out of me.
<p/>Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever.

<p/>The Honest Tradesman To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) stool in Fleet-street with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) grisly urchin beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented.
<p/>Who could sit upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun, both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down!
<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) straw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams, like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry.
<p/>Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind, since a small part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) income was derived from the pilotage of timid women -LRB-mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life-RRB- from Tellson's side of the tides to the opposite shore.
<p/>Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) very good health.
<p/>And it was from the gifts bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) towards the execution of this benevolent purpose, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) recruited his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) finances, as just now observed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said a last <div class="bookquote">``God bless you!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). XIV. Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in the sight of men.
<p/>Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place, but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>).
<p/>It fell out that he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few, and belated women few, and when his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) breast that Mrs. Cruncher must have been <div class="bookquote">``flopping''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cruncher</b></font>)</div>in some pointed manner, when an unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) attention.
<p/>Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this funeral, which engendered uproar. ''
<p/>Young Jerry,'' said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) offspring, <div class="bookquote">``it's a buryin'. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hooroar, father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>cried Young Jerry. The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance.
<p/>The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.
<p/>'' What d'ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey to your own father, you young Rip?
<p/>This boy is a getting too many for me !'' said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>). '' Him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) hooroars! Don't let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me.
<p/>D'ye hear?'' <div class="bookquote">``I warn't doing no harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Young</b></font>)</div>Young Jerry protested, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) cheek. '' Drop it then,'' said Mr. Cruncher; <div class="bookquote">``I won't have none of your no harms.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach
<p/>Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position.
<p/>The position appeared by no means to please him (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>), however, with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach, deriding him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), making grimaces at him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), and incessantly groaning and calling out:
<p/>Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) always pricked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed Tellson's.
<p/>Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) greatly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) asked of the first man who ran against him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>): ``What is it, brother?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat. What's it about? '' '' I don't know,'' said the man.
<p/>'' I don't know,'' returned the man, clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour, <div class="bookquote">``Spies!
<p/>At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and from this person he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learned that the funeral was the funeral of one Roger Cly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) asked another man. '' Who is it?'' Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!'' '' Was He (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) a spy?
<p/>'' asked Mr. Cruncher. '' Old Bailey spy,'' returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) informant. '' Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey Spi--i --ies!'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, to be sure!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had assisted. '' I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>). Dead, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>)?'' '' Dead as mutton,'' returned the other, <div class="bookquote">``and can't be too dead.
<p/>The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea, that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the suggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop.
<p/>On the crowd's opening the coach doors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands for a moment; but he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) was so alert, and made such good use of his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) time, that in another moment he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) was scouring away up a bye-street, after shedding his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and other symbolical tears.
<p/>These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.
<p/>They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing.
<p/>Practical suggestions being much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out, while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it.
<p/>Among the first of these volunteers was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) spiky head from the observation of Tellson's, in the further corner of the mourning coach.
<p/>The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.
<p/>The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>), under close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended by his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach.
<p/>A bear-leader, a popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) walked.
<p/>Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it.
<p/>Have 'em out, there! Spies! Pull 'em out, there! Spies! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Saint</b></font>)</div>Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields.
<p/>It got there in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally, accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and highly to its own satisfaction.
<p/>The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius -LRB-or perhaps the same-RRB- conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them.
<p/>Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and they were roughly hustled and maltreated.
<p/>At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were coming.
<p/>Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual progress of a mob.
<p/>Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.
<p/>The transition to the sport of window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy and natural. The place had a soothing influence on him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) procured a pipe from a neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot.
<p/>Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) was a young `un and a straight made `un.
<p/>Having smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) turned himself about, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) might appear, before the hour of closing, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) station at Tellson's.
<p/>Whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) meditations on mortality had touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) liver, or whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) general health had been previously at all amiss, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) desired to show a little attention to an eminent man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) made a short call upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) way back.
<p/>'' Jerry,'' said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) usual way, <div class="bookquote">``you see that there ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>Young Jerry relieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father with dutiful interest, and reported No job in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) absence.
<p/>The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) son went home to tea.
<p/>If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work you for it just the same as if I seen you do it.
<p/>'' Now, I tell you where it is!'' said Mr. Cruncher to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) wife, on entering. '' '' The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' Why, you're at it afore my face! '' said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of angry apprehension. '' I am saying nothing.
<p/>'' '' Well, then; don't meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate. You may as well go again me one way as another.
<p/>Drop it altogether. '' '' Yes, Jerry.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Jerry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. '' Ah! It is yes, Jerry.
<p/>Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general ironical dissatisfaction.
<p/>You and your yes, Jerry,'' said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) saucer.
<p/>That's about it. You may say yes, Jerry. '' '' '' Ah! I think so. I believe you. '' <div class="bookquote">``You are going out to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) decent wife, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) took another bite.
<p/>'' Yes, I am. '' <div class="bookquote">``May I go with you, father? ''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son, briskly. '' No, you mayn't. I'm a going--as your mother knows--a fishing.
<p/>That's where I'm going to. Going a fishing. '' <div class="bookquote">``Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never you mind. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>If I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow,'' returned that gentleman, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``that's questions enough for you; I ain't a going out, till you've been long abed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) in conversation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) disadvantage.
<p/>With this view, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) urged his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) son to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) in conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could bring against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), rather than he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for a moment to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own reflections.
<p/>The devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did in this distrust of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>Shall you bring any fish home, father?'' '' '' It was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.
<p/>If I, as a honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread.
<p/>'' And mind you!'' said Mr. Cruncher. '' No games to-morrow! If I, as a honest tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring on water.
<p/>When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly customer to you, if you don't. I 'm your Rome
<p/>, you know. '' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) began grumbling again: <div class="bookquote">``With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink!
<p/>I don't know how scarce you mayn't make the wittles and drink here, by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct.
<p/>Look at your boy: he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is your`n, ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother, and not know that a mother's first duty is to blow her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) boy out?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) mother to perform her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) first duty, and, whatever else she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did or neglected, above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) other parent.
<p/>Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry was ordered to bed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) mother, laid under similar injunctions, obeyed them.
<p/>Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes, and did not start upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) excursion until nearly one o'clock.
<p/>Towards that small and ghostly hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) rose up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) chair, took a key out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other fishing tackle of that nature.
<p/>Disposing these articles about him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) in skilful manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher, extinguished the light, and went out.
<p/>Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) went to bed, was not long after his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father.
<p/>Under cover of the darkness he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the court, followed out into the streets.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) was in no uneasiness concerning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the door stood ajar all night.
<p/>Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father's honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts, walls, and doorways, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) eyes were close to one another, held his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) honoured parent in view.
<p/>The honoured parent steering Northward, had not gone far, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and the two trudged on together.
<p/>Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a lonely road.
<p/>Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently, that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split himself into two.
<p/>The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing.
<p/>In the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.
<p/>Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that Young Jerry saw, was the form of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) honoured parent, pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay there a little--listening perhaps.
<p/>Then, they moved away on their hands and knees. It was now Young Jerry's turn to approach the gate: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) did, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) breath.
<p/>Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!
<p/>and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant.
<p/>They did not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to fish. They fished with a spade, at first.
<p/>Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) made off, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) hair as stiff as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father's.
<p/>But, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not only stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) running away, but lured him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) back again.
<p/>They were still fishing perseveringly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) peeped in at the gate for the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite.
<p/>Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew. There was a screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were strained, as if by a weight.
<p/>Young Jerry very well knew what it would be; but, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) saw it, and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) honoured parent about to wrench it open, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) made off again, and never stopped until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had run a mile or more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath, it being a spectral sort of race that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) ran, and one highly desirable to get to the end of.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had a strong idea that the coffin he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had seen was running after him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>); and, pictured as hopping on behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>), bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) and hopping on at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) side--perhaps taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) arm--it was a pursuer to shun.
<p/>It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it was making the whole night behind him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) dreadful, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy's Kite without tail and wings.
<p/>It hid in doorways too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up to its ears, as if it were laughing.
<p/>By slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it, and came to the surface. It got into shadows on the road, and lay cunningly on its back to trip him (<font color='blue'><b>Kite</b></font>) up.
<p/>All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him (<font color='blue'><b>Kite</b></font>), so that when the boy got to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own door he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had reason for being half dead.
<p/>And even then it would not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), but followed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) upstairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled into bed with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breast when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fell asleep.
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father in the family room.
<p/>Something had gone wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>); at least, so Young Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears, and knocking the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) head against the head-board of the bed.
<p/>'' I told you I would,'' said Mr. Cruncher, <div class="bookquote">``and I did.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) wife implored. '' You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,'' said Jerry, <div class="bookquote">``and me and my partners suffer.
<p/>You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I try to be a good wife, Jerry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the poor woman protested, with tears.
<p/>'' Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business? Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) business?
<p/>Is it obeying your husband to disobey him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on the wital subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) business?'' <div class="bookquote">``You hadn't taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>It's enough for you,'' retorted Mr. Cruncher, <div class="bookquote">``to be the wife of a honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) took to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) trade or when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) didn't.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>A honouring and obeying wife would let his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious woman? If you're a religious woman, give me a irreligious one!
<p/>You have no more nat`ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.
<p/>The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in the honest tradesman's kicking off his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) clay-soiled boots, and lying down at his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) length on the floor.
<p/>After taking a timid peep at him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) back, with his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) rusty hands under his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) head for a pillow, his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) son lay down too, and fell asleep again.
<p/>Mr. Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid by him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) should observe any symptoms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) saying Grace.
<p/>'' There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) was brushed and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) son to pursue his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) ostensible calling.
<p/>Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) arm at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) father's side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) of the previous night, running home through darkness and solitude from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) grim pursuer.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) cunning was fresh with the day, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not improbable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London, that fine morning.
<p/>Father,'' said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep at arm's length and to have the stool well between them:
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``what's a Resurrection-Man? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Young Jerry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``How should I know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Well,'' returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) hat to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) spikes free play, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>)'s a tradesman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you knowed everything, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the artless boy. <div class="bookquote">``Hem! ''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>'' What's his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) goods, father?'' asked the brisk Young Jerry.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) goods,'' said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) mind, <div class="bookquote">``is a branch of Scientific goods.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Persons' bodies, ain't it, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>asked the lively boy.
<p/>'' I believe it is something of that sort,'' said Mr. Cruncher. '' Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite growed up!''
<p/>Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) head in a dubious and moral way. '' It depends upon how you dewelop your talents.
<p/>Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for.
<p/>As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to himself: <div class="bookquote">``Jerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother!
<p/>As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine.
<p/>Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sold at this time.
<p/>A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy.
<p/>No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it.
<p/>This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>'' XV. Knitting There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come.
<p/>There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls.
<p/>These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy looks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), nobody asked for him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) seat, presiding over the distribution of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.
<p/>A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in at every place, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's gaol.
<p/>Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) sleeve with her (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off.
<p/>Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop was not visible. Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>), until midday.
<p/>It was high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) streets and under his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a mender of roads in a blue cap.
<p/>Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows.
<p/>Yet, no one had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.
<p/>All adust and athirst, the two entered the wine-shop. '' Good day, gentlemen!'' said Monsieur Defarge. It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue.
<p/>It elicited an answering chorus of <div class="bookquote">``Good day!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is bad weather, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. Upon which, every man looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour, and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent.
<p/>My wife,'' said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: <div class="bookquote">``I have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called Jacques.
<p/>Except one man, who got up and went out. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>I met him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--by accident-- a day and half's journey out of Paris.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) to drink, my wife! '' A second man got up and went out.
<p/>Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) blue cap to the company, and drank.
<p/>In the breast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) blouse he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) carried some coarse dark bread; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defarge's counter.
<p/>Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) took less than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) breakfast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>); not even Madame Defarge, who had taken up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) knitting, and was at work.
<p/>A third man got up and went out. '' Have you finished your repast, friend? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked, in due season.
<p/>'' Yes, thank you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.
<p/>Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>No man</b></font>)</div>No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly.
<p/>And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) through the chinks in the wall.
<p/>Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice: ``Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four.
<p/>The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) swarthy forehead with it, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Where shall I commence, monsieur?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) then, messieurs,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>began the mender of roads, <div class="bookquote">``a year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the chain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) will tell you all. Speak, Jacques Five!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Commence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, <div class="bookquote">``at the commencement. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Behold the manner of it.
<p/>I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) hanging by the chain--like this.
<p/>Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) village during a whole year.
<p/>'' Jacques One struck in, and asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) had ever seen the man before? '' Never,'' answered the mender of roads, recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) perpendicular.
<p/>Jacques Three demanded how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) afterwards recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) then? '' By his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) tall figure,'' said the mender of roads, softly, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) finger at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) nose.
<p/>'' When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening, `Say, what is he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) like?' I make response, `Tall as a spectre.''' <div class="bookquote">``You should have said, short as a dwarf,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques</b></font>)</div>returned Jacques Two.
<p/>'' But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not offer my testimony.
<p/>Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, `To me! Bring that rascal!' My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) is right there, Jacques,'' murmured Defarge, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) who had interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``Go on!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery.
<p/>'' The tall man is lost, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?'' '' No matter, the number,'' said Defarge.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is well hidden, but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is unluckily found. Go on!'' <div class="bookquote">``I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to go to bed.
<p/>I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see coming over the hill six soldiers.
<p/>With the aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indispensable cap, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) represented a man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbows bound fast at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hips, with cords that were knotted behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass -LRB-for it is a solitary road, that, where any spectacle is well worth looking at-RRB-, and at first, as they approach, I see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs.
<p/>Also, I see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.
<p/>Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves with them as they come, tramp, tramp!
<p/>In the midst of them is a tall man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms bound--tied to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sides--like this! ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' But when they advance quite near to me, I recognise the tall man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognises me.
<p/>Ah, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as on the evening when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and I first encountered, close to the same spot!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) described it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were there, and it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw it vividly; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not seen much in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.
<p/>I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not show the soldiers that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with our eyes. '
<p/>'' Come on!' says the chief of that company, pointing to the village, `bring him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) fast to his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) tomb!' and they bring him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) faster.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) wooden shoes are large and clumsy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) is lame.
<p/>I follow. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) is lame, and consequently slow, they drive him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) with their guns--like this!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the butt-ends of muskets.
<p/>'' As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) falls. They laugh and pick him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up again. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face is bleeding and covered with dust, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again.
<p/>They bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the village; all the village runs to look; they take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) past the mill, and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night, and swallow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--like this!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth as wide as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could, and shut it with a sounding snap of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth. Observant of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again, Defarge said, <div class="bookquote">``Go on, Jacques.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the village,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it, except to perish.
<p/>In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on my way to my work.
<p/>There I see him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), high up, behind the bars of a lofty iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has no hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) regards me like a dead man.
<p/>The looks of all of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the countryman's story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was authoritative too.
<p/>Jacques One and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>) chin resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>) hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>) eyes intent on the road-mender;
<p/>Jacques Three, equally intent, on one knee behind them, with his (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>) agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>) mouth and nose; Defarge standing between them and the narrator, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>) had stationed in the light of the window, by turns looking from him (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>) to them, and from them to him (<font color='blue'><b>One</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. They had the air of a rough tribunal; '' Go on, Jacques,'' said Defarge.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) remains up there in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) iron cage some days. The village looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) by stealth, for it is afraid.
<p/>But it always looks up, from a distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all faces are turned towards the prison.
<p/>They whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) will not be executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) was enraged and made mad by the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) child; they say that a petition has been presented to the King himself.
<p/>Formerly, they were turned towards the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. What do I know? It is possible.
<p/>Perhaps yes, perhaps no.'' <div class="bookquote">``Listen then, Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Number One of that name sternly interposed. '' Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen.
<p/>It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the hazard of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hand.''
<p/>All here, yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) carriage in the street, sitting beside the Queen. '' And once again listen, Jacques!'' said the kneeling
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a strikingly greedy air, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) hungered for something--that was neither food nor drink; <div class="bookquote">``the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner, and struck him (<font color='blue'><b>petitioner</b></font>) blows.
<p/>Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>resumed the countryman, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) will very certainly be executed.
<p/>They even whisper that because he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the father of his (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) tenants--serfs--what you will--he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) will be executed as a parricide.
<p/>One old man says at the fountain, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right hand, armed with the knife, will be burnt off before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face; that, into wounds which will be made in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs, there will be poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses.
<p/>That old man says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen.
<p/>Number Three: You hear?''  (<font color='red'><b>the countryman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hear, messieurs.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go on then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge. '' But how do I know if he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lies?
<p/>I am not a scholar.'' <div class="bookquote">``Listen once again then, Jacques!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man air</b></font>)</div>said the man with the restless hand and the craving air.
<p/>The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed!
<p/>'' And it was done--why, how old are you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Thirty-five,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the mender of roads, who looked sixty. '' It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen it.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, with grim impatience. '' Long live the Devil! Go on.'' '' Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that
<p/>At length, on Sunday night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.
<p/>Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the water.
<p/>The mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceiling, and pointed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.
<p/>; they speak of nothing else; even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. '' '' All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out, the cows are there with the rest.
<p/>At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers have marched into the prison in the night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) is in the midst of many soldiers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) is bound as before, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) mouth there is a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) look almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) laughed.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) suggested it, by creasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) two thumbs, from the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) mouth to his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) ears.
<p/>'' On the top of the gallows is fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) is hanged there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water.
<p/>They looked at one another, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) used his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) blue cap to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) face, on which the perspiration had started afresh while he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) recalled the spectacle.
<p/>'' '' It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow!
<p/>When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church, across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth, messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!''
<p/>The hungry man gnawed one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at the other three, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger quivered with the craving that was on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>I left at sunset -LRB-as I had been warned to do-RRB-, and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met -LRB-as I was warned I should-RRB- this comrade.
<p/>Under it, have I said? '' That's all, messieurs. With him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>), I came on, now riding and now walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night.
<p/>And here you see me!'' After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, <div class="bookquote">``Good! You have acted and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the door?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques One</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very willingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.
<p/>The three had risen, and their heads were together when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) came back to the garret. '' How say you, Jacques?
<p/>'' demanded Number One. '' To be registered? '' <div class="bookquote">``To be registered, as doomed to destruction,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>returned Defarge. '' Magnificent! '' croaked the man with the craving.
<p/>'' The chateau, and all the race?'' inquired the first. '' The chateau and all the race,'' returned Defarge. <div class="bookquote">``Extermination. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, <div class="bookquote">``Magnificent!''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>and began gnawing another finger. '' Are you sure,'' asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, <div class="bookquote">``that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register?
<p/>Without doubt it is safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>returned Defarge, drawing himself up, ``if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) memory alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not lose a word of it--not a syllable of it.
<p/>Knitted, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own stitches and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own symbols, it will always be as plain to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as the sun. Confide in Madame Defarge.
<p/>It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives, to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) name or crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.
<p/>There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who hungered, asked: <div class="bookquote">``Is this rustic to be sent back soon?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Defarge; <div class="bookquote">``at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height.
<p/>I charge myself with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remain with me; I will take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and set him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) road.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>I hope so. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very simple; is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not a little dangerous?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and Court; let him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) see them on Sunday.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the hungry man, staring. <div class="bookquote">``Is it a good sign, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge; <div class="bookquote">``judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) to thirst for it.
<p/>Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the pallet-bed and take some rest.
<p/>Judiciously show a dog his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) natural prey, if you wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) to bring it down one day. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) needed no persuasion, and was soon asleep.
<p/>Worse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop, could easily have been found in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was constantly haunted, his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) life was very new and agreeable.
<p/>But, madame sat all day at her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) counter, so expressly unconscious of him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), and so particularly determined not to perceive that his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) shook in his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) wooden shoes whenever his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) eye lighted on her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>).
<p/>For, he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next; and he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) felt assured that if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should take it into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brightly ornamented head to pretend that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) do a murder and afterwards flay the victim, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out.
<p/>Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was-RRB- to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to Versailles.
<p/>It was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon, still with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the King and Queen.
<p/>'' You work hard, madame,'' said a man near her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>). '' Yes,'' answered Madame Defarge; <div class="bookquote">``I have a good deal to do.
<p/>The man moved a little further away, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could, and the mender of roads fanned himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blue cap: feeling it mightily close and oppressive.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needed a King and Queen to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was fortunate in having his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the shining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) temporary intoxication, that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen, Long live everybody and everything!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>'' What do you make, madame? '' <div class="bookquote">``Many things.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``For instance--''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``For instance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>returned Madame Defarge, composedly, <div class="bookquote">``shrouds. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>as if he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) time.
<p/>Then, there were gardens, courtyards, terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye, more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) absolutely wept with sentiment.
<p/>During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three hours, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company, and throughout Defarge held him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) by the collar, as if to restrain him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) from flying at the objects of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) brief devotion and tearing them to pieces.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, clapping him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) on the back when it was over, like a patron; <div class="bookquote">``you are a good boy! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>a patron</b></font>)</div><p/>The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) late demonstrations; but no.
<p/>You are the fellow we want,'' said Defarge, in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ear; <div class="bookquote">``you make these fools believe that it will last for ever.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Then, they are the more insolent, and it is the nearer ended.'' <div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the mender of roads, reflectively; <div class="bookquote">``that's true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>While they despise your breath, and would stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath tells them.
<p/>'' These fools know nothing. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot deceive them too much. '' Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in confirmation.
<p/>As to you,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you would shout and shed tears for anything, if it made a show and a noise.
<p/>If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would pick out the richest and gayest.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Say! Would you not?'' '' Truly, madame, I think so. For the moment. '' '' Say! Would you not?'' ''
<p/>And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage, you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have seen both dolls and birds to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, with a wave of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hand towards the place where they had last been apparent; <div class="bookquote">``now, go home!
<p/>Still Knitting Madame Defarge and monsieur her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) husband returned amicably to the bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) grave, listened to the whispering trees.
<p/>Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now, for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered.
<p/>A rumour just lived in the village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever.
<p/>In the stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there.
<p/>Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the stone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line.
<p/>Truly yes, madame.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. would you not?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is true, madame.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' XVI. So does a whole world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling star.
<p/>And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.
<p/>The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight, in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their journey naturally tended.
<p/>There was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination and inquiry.
<p/>Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two of the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was intimate with, and affectionately embraced.
<p/>When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) dusky wings, and they, having finally alighted near the Saint's boundaries, were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) husband:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee? ''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very little to-night, but all he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) knows. There is another spy commissioned for our quarter.
<p/>There may be many more, for all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) can say, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) knows of one.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Eh well!'' said Madame Defarge, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>police</b></font>) eyebrows with a cool business air.
<p/>'' It is necessary to register him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>). How do they call that man?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is English.'' <div class="bookquote">``So much the better.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Barsad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been so careful to get it accurately, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then spelt it with perfect correctness.
<p/>'' Barsad,'' repeated madame. '' Good. Christian name?'' <div class="bookquote">``John.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``John Barsad,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself. '' Good.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair; complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore, sinister.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) appearance; is it known?'' '' Eh my faith. It is a portrait!'' said madame, laughing. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) shall be registered to-morrow.
<p/>They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed -LRB-for it was midnight-RRB-, and where Madame Defarge immediately took her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) post at her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) desk, counted the small moneys that had been taken during her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) absence, examined the stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to bed.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Defarge</b></font>) handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the night.
<p/>All this while, Defarge, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth, walked up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which condition, indeed, as to the business and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) domestic affairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked up and down through life.
<p/>Monsieur Defarge's olfactory sense was by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed.
<p/>'' The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whiffed the compound of scents away, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smoked-out pipe.
<p/>'' You are fatigued,'' said madame, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glance as she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knotted the money. '' There are only the usual odours.''
<p/>You are a little depressed, too,'' said madame, whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a little tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) husband acknowledged. '' '' Oh, the men, the men!'' '' But my dear!'' began Defarge.
<p/>'' But my dear!'' repeated madame, nodding firmly; <div class="bookquote">``but my dear! You are faint of heart to-night, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>'' Well, then,'' said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) breast, <div class="bookquote">``it is a long time.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife; <div class="bookquote">``and when is it not a long time?

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge. '' How long,'' demanded madame, composedly, <div class="bookquote">``does it take to make and store the lightning?
<p/>Tell me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Defarge raised his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that too. '' It does not take a long time,'' said madame, <div class="bookquote">``for an earthquake to swallow a town.
<p/>Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake?''  (<font color='red'><b>madame</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A long time, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge. '' But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything before it.
<p/>In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it. ''
<p/>I tell thee,'' said madame, extending her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) right hand, for emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe. ''  (<font color='red'><b>madame</b></font>)</div>I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops.
<p/>Look around and consider the lives of all the world that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hour.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brave wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>returned Defarge, standing before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) head a little bent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) hands clasped at his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) back, like a docile and attentive pupil before his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) catechist, <div class="bookquote">``I do not question all this.
<p/>I tell thee it is always advancing. Can such things last? Bah! I mock you.''  (<font color='red'><b>catechist</b></font>)</div>But it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--
<p/>you know well, my wife, it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives.'' '' Eh well! How then?'' demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there were another enemy strangled.
<p/>'' Well!'' said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug. '' We shall not see the triumph.'' <div class="bookquote">``We shall have helped it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned madame, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) extended hand in strong action.
<p/>'' Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all my soul, that we shall see the triumph.
<p/>But even if not, even if I knew certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I would--
<p/>'' Then madame, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed. <div class="bookquote">``Hold! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) felt charged with cowardice;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I too, my dear, will stop at nothing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity, to sustain you.
<p/>When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready.
<p/>Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) little counter with her (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) chain of money as if she (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) knocked its brains out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) arm in a serene manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.
<p/>Sustain yourself without that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) usual place in the wine-shop, knitting away assiduously.
<p/>A rose lay beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) usual preoccupied air.
<p/>The day was very hot, and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell dead at the bottom.
<p/>Their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner -LRB-as if they themselves were elephants, or something as far removed-RRB-, until they met the same fate.
<p/>There were a few customers, drinking or not drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.
<p/>A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) felt to be a new one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) knitting, and began to pin her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) head-dress, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) looked at the figure.
<p/>The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the wine-shop.
<p/>It was curious. '' Good day, madame,'' said the new-comer. '' Good day, monsieur. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) said it aloud, but added to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) knitting: <div class="bookquote">``Hah!
<p/>Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark, thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression!
<p/>Good day, one and all!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.
<p/>It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame complied with a polite air. '' Marvellous cognac this, madame! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) knitting.
<p/>The visitor watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. '' You knit with great skill, madame.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am accustomed to it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A pretty pattern too!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' You think so?'' said madame, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) with a smile.
<p/>'' Decidedly. May one ask what it is for? '' <div class="bookquote">``Pastime,''  (<font color='red'><b>madame</b></font>)</div>said madame, still looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) with a smile while her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) fingers moved nimbly.
<p/>If I do--Well,'' said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) head with a stern kind of coquetry, <div class="bookquote">``I'll use it!
<p/>It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge.
<p/>Two men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when, catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>madame</b></font>)</div>Not for use?'' <div class="bookquote">``That depends. I may find a use for it one day. ''  (<font color='red'><b>this visitor</b></font>)</div>Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left.
<p/>They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) eyes open, but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and unimpeachable.
<p/>'' John ,'' thought madame, checking off her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) work as her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) fingers knitted, and her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) eyes looked at the stranger. ''
<p/>Stay long enough, and I shall knit `BARSAD' before you go. '' <div class="bookquote">``You have a husband, madame?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Children?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No children.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``As you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>madame retorted, correcting him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and deftly knitting an extra something into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) name that boded him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) no good.
<p/>So oppressed, too--as you say. '' Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so. Of course.
<p/>'' '' I think? '' returned madame, in a high voice. '' I and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking.
<p/>That is the subject we think of, and it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without embarrassing our heads concerning others.
<p/>The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) could find or make, did not allow his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) baffled state to express itself in his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) sinister face; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) elbow on Madame Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) cognac.
<p/>All we think, here, is how to live. I think for others? No, no. '' '' A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution.
<p/>Ah! the poor Gaspard! '' With a sigh of great compassion. '' My faith!'' returned madame, coolly and lightly, ``if people use knives for such purposes, they have to pay for it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) wicked face: <div class="bookquote">``I believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knew beforehand what the price of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) luxury was; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has paid the price.''

<p/>As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) by touching his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, <div class="bookquote">``Good day, Jacques!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Good day, Jacques!'' the spy repeated; with not quite so much confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.
<p/>'' Is there not?'' ''--Here is my husband!'' said Madame Defarge. Defarge stopped short, and stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). '' '' You deceive yourself, monsieur,'' returned the keeper of the wine-shop.
<p/>'' You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy day</b></font>)</div>said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: <div class="bookquote">``good day!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the spy day</b></font>)</div><p/>I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>answered Defarge, drily. '' '' No one has told me so,'' said Defarge, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspard</b></font>) head. '' I know nothing of it.
<p/>Having said it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspard</b></font>) passed behind the little counter, and stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspard</b></font>) hand on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspard</b></font>) wife's chair, looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction.
<p/>The spy, well used to his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) business, did not change his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) unconscious attitude, but drained his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh water, and asked for another glass of cognac.
<p/>'' Madame Defarge poured it out for him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>), took to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knitting again, and hummed a little song over it. ''
<p/>You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?'' observed Defarge. '' Not at all, but I hope to know it better.
<p/>The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,'' pursued the spy, <div class="bookquote">``that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div><p/>I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants.'' <div class="bookquote">``Hah! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>muttered Defarge. '' <div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, with much indifference. ''
<p/>Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) old domestic, had the charge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), I know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was delivered to you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had had it conveyed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), in an accidental touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) wife's elbow as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knitted and warbled, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) would do best to answer, but always with brevity.
<p/>It was to you,'' said the spy, <div class="bookquote">``that his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) daughter came; and it was from your care that his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) daughter took him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>), accompanied by a neat brown monsieur; how is he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) called?--in a little wig--
<p/>You see I am informed of the circumstances?''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>'' Such is the fact, certainly,'' said Defarge. '' Lorry--of the bank of Tellson and Company--over to England.
<p/>'' '' Such is the fact,'' repeated Defarge. '' Very interesting remembrances!'' said the spy. '' I have known Doctor Manette and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter, in England.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge. '' You don't hear much about them now?'' said the spy. '' No,'' said Defarge. '' In effect,'' madame struck in, looking up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) work and her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) little song, <div class="bookquote">``we never hear about them.
<p/>We received the news of their safe arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then, they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held no correspondence.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly so, madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>replied the spy. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) is going to be married. '' <div class="bookquote">``Going? ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>echoed madame. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) was pretty enough to have been married long ago.
<p/>You English are cold, it seems to me.'' '' Oh! You know I am English. '' <div class="bookquote">``I perceive your tongue is,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned madame; <div class="bookquote">``and what the tongue is, I suppose the man is.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not take the identification as a compliment; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made the best of it, and turned it off with a laugh.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cognac to the end, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to one who, like herself, is French by birth.
<p/>It was cruel, cruel!-RRB-, it is a curious thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present Marquis.
<p/>And speaking of Gaspard -LRB-ah, poor Gaspard! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspard</b></font>) lives unknown in England, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspard</b></font>) is no Marquis there; he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) is Mr. Charles Darnay.
<p/>D'Aulnais is the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) mother's family. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband.
<p/>Do what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would, behind the little counter, as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pipe, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was troubled, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand was not trustworthy.
<p/>The spy would have been no spy if he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) had failed to see it, or to record it in his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be worth, and no customers coming in to help him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) to any other, Mr. Barsad paid for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) had drunk, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) leave: taking occasion to say, in a genteel manner, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) departed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) looked forward to the pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again.
<p/>For some minutes after he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the husband and wife remained exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) had left them, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) should come back.
<p/>Can it be true,'' said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) wife as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) stood smoking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) hand on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chair: <div class="bookquote">``what he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) has said of Ma'amselle Manette?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' As he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) has said it,'' returned madame, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyebrows a little, <div class="bookquote">``it is probably false. But it may be true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sake, Destiny will keep her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband out of France.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's destiny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) usual composure, <div class="bookquote">``will take him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is to go, and will lead him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to the end that is to end him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>If it is--'' Defarge began, and stopped. '' If it is?'' repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife. '' That is all I know.''
<p/>strange''--said Defarge, rather pleading with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife to induce her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to admit it, <div class="bookquote">``that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father, and herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by the side of that infernal dog's who has just left us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very '' Stranger things than that will happen when it does come,'' answered madame.
<p/>'' I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here for their merits; that is enough. ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rolled up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knitting when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had said those words, and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head.
<p/>Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its disappearance; howbeit,
<p/>the Saint took courage to lounge in, very shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect. In the evening, at which season of all others
<p/>Saint Antoine turned himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame Defarge with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) work in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group:
<p/>They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still, the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.
<p/>a Missionary--there were many like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women knitted. But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts.
<p/>And as Madame Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had spoken with, and left behind.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband smoked at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) door, looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with admiration. '' A great woman,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``a strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully grand woman!
<p/>Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells and the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard, as the women sat knitting, knitting.
<p/>Another darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty, Freedom and Life.
<p/>So much was closing in about the women who sat knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting, counting dropping heads.
<p/>One Night Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter sat under the plane-tree together.
<p/>Never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Darkness encompassed them. XVII. Lucie was to be married to-morrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had reserved this last evening for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.
<p/>'' You are happy, my dear father?'' <div class="bookquote">``Quite, my child. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
<p/>When it was yet light enough to work and read, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had neither engaged herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) usual work, nor had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) read to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had employed herself in both ways, at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.
<p/>'' And I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in the love that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles's love for me.
<p/>But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and self-reproachful now than I can tell you.
<p/>Even as it is--'' Even as it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could not command her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice. In the sad moonlight, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) clasped him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) by the neck, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) breast.
<p/>In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of the sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and its going.
<p/>Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite, quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will ever interpose between us?
<p/>'' Dearest dear! I know it well, but do you know it? In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?
<p/>More than that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) added, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tenderly kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``my future is far brighter, Lucie, seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever was--without it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could scarcely have assumed, <div class="bookquote">``Quite sure, my darling! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If I could hope that , my father!--'' <div class="bookquote">``Believe it, love!
<p/>Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be wasted--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hand towards his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lips, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took it in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and repeated the word. '' --wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the natural order of things--for my sake.
<p/>Your unselfishness cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself, how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) unconscious admission that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) would have been unhappy without Charles, having seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); and replied: <div class="bookquote">``My child, you did see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and it is Charles.

<p/>It was the first time, except at the trial, of her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) ever hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) refer to the period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) suffering.
<p/>It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) a strange and new sensation while his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) words were in her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) ears; and she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) remembered it long afterwards.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``See!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand towards the moon.

<p/>But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could--I have imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as coming to me in my cell, and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress.
<p/>I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, Lucie? did I say just now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) knew nothing of you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) cared nothing for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So! But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?'' '' No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of sight, but it never moved.
<p/>The phantom that my mind pursued, was another and more real child. Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) outward appearance I know no more than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) mother.
<p/>The other had that likeness too--as you have--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think? I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) collected and calm manner could not prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) blood from running cold, as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) thus tried to anatomise his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) old condition.
<p/>In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), in the moonlight, coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) married life was full of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) loving remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) lost father.
<p/>'' '' My picture was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) room, and I was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) prayers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) life was active, cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love that was I. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) showed me her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) children,'' said the Doctor of Beauvais, <div class="bookquote">``and they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me.
<p/>When they passed a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked up at its bars, and spoke in whispers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) could never deliver me; I imagined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) always brought me back after showing me such things. But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Beauvais</b></font>)</div><p/>``Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great happiness.
<p/>My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you bless me as fervently to-morrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), solemnly commended her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) to Heaven, and humbly thanked Heaven for having bestowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). By-and-bye, they went into the house.
<p/>There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross.
<p/>The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it, by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.
<p/>Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only three at table, and Miss Pross made the third.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) regretted that Charles was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) away; and drank to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) affectionately.
<p/>But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came downstairs again, and stole into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) room; not free from unshaped fears, beforehand.
<p/>All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lay asleep, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands lying quiet on the coverlet.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) needless candle in the shadow at a distance, crept up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bed, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) lips to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); then, leaned over him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).
<p/>Into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) held the mastery of them even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sleep.
<p/>A more remarkable face in its quiet, resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) timidly laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) dear breast, and put up a prayer that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) might ever be as true to him (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) love aspired to be, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) sorrows deserved.
<p/>So, the time came for him (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) to bid Lucie good night, and they separated. Then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hand, and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) lips once more, and went away.
<p/>So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>) face, as softly as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) lips had moved in praying for him (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>).
<p/>The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctor's room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was speaking with Charles Darnay.
<p/>They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss, but for the yet lingering consideration that her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) brother Solomon should have been the bridegroom.
<p/>And so,'' said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride, and who had been moving round her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) to take in every point of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) quiet, pretty dress;

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>From Miss Pross. '' You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?'' asked the gentleman of that name.

(<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,'' drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) arm soothingly round her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) waist,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear.
<p/>You leave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your own; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's shall go to the wall -LRB-comparatively speaking-RRB- before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>And when, at the fortnight's end, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes to join you and your beloved husband, on your other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to you in the best health and in the happiest frame.
<p/>Now, I hear Somebody's step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) own.
<p/>For a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) held the fair face from him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) to look at the well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright golden hair against his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) face.
<p/>But, in the composure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) was unaltered, except that to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), like a cold wind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) arm to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) daughter, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) down-stairs to the chariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day.
<p/>The rest followed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.
<p/>Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling, glanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets.
<p/>They returned home to breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the door at parting.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>The door of the Doctor's room opened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) came out with Charles Darnay. It was a hard parting, though it was not for long.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) father cheered her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) enfolding arms, <div class="bookquote">``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), Charles! She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) is yours!
<p/>The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross, were left quite alone.
<p/>It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there, had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) a poisoned blow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been expected in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) when the occasion for repression was gone.
<p/>But, it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) absent manner of clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head and drearily wandering away into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.
<p/>I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, <div class="bookquote">``I think we had best not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) just now, or at all disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was gone. '' I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back presently.
<p/>Then, we will take him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) a ride into the country, and dine there, and all will be well. '' It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of Tellson's.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) came back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus into the Doctor's rooms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was stopped by a low sound of knocking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was detained two hours. '' Good God! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, with a start. '' What's that?'' Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ear.
<p/>'' O me, O me! All is lost! '' cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) hands. '' What is to be told to Ladybird?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) doesn't know me, and is making shoes!'' Mr. Lorry said what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could to calm her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), and went himself into the Doctor's room.
<p/>The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had seen the shoemaker at his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) work before, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) head was bent down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was very busy.
<p/>The Doctor looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) work again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had laid aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) coat and waistcoat; his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).
<p/>Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape.
<p/>'' Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) worked hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) took up another that was lying by him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), and asked what it was.
<p/>'' A young lady's walking shoe,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) muttered, without looking up. '' It ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.''
<p/>'' But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) work. ''
<p/>You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper occupation. Think, dear friend!'' Nothing would induce him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to speak more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked up, for an instant at a time, when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract a word from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and words fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air.
<p/>In that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) were trying to reconcile some doubts in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie; the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).
<p/>In conjunction with Miss Pross, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) took immediate steps towards the latter precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a few days of complete rest.
<p/>In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) having been called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) own hand, represented to have been addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) by the same post.
<p/>The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in the hope of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) coming to himself.
<p/>If that should happen soon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) kept another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thought the best, on the Doctor's case.
<p/>In the hope of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) recovery, and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) life, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) post by the window in the same room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), since, on being pressed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) became worried.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) abandoned that attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), as a silent protest against the delusion into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had fallen, or was falling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) remained, therefore, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) seat near the window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could think of, that it was a free place.
<p/>Doctor Manette took what was given him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to eat and drink, and worked on, that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) life, to read or write.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Will you go out?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked down at the floor on either side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in the old manner, looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Out?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes; for a walk with me. Why not? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more.
<p/>But, Mr. Lorry thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) saw, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) leaned forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) bench in the dusk, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knees and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was in some misty way asking himself, <div class="bookquote">``Why not?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it. Miss Pross and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) divided the night into two watches, and observed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at intervals from the adjoining room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paced up and down for a long time before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay down; but, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did finally lay himself down, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell asleep.
<p/>On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) cheerfully by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) name, and spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) on topics that had been of late familiar to them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) returned no reply, but it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) heard what was said, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thought about it, however confusedly.
<p/>This encouraged Mr. Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) work, several times during the day; at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father then present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing amiss.
<p/>This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or often enough to harass him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and it lightened Mr. Lorry's friendly heart to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked up oftener, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).
<p/>In the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was up betimes, and went straight to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) bench and to work. When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) as before: <div class="bookquote">``Dear Doctor, will you go out?
<p/>This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could extract no answer from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned.
<p/>In the meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) slipped away to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) bench.
<p/>The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>As before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``Out?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yes; for a walk with me. Why not? '' The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth.
<p/>With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time.
<p/>The secret was well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could not fail to observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first, was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) had never been so intent on his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) work, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in the dusk of the ninth evening.
<p/>Five days, six days, seven days, eight days, nine days. XIX. An Opinion Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) post.
<p/>On the tenth morning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) suspense, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) when it was dark night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes and roused himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) doubted, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had done so, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was not still asleep.
<p/>For, going to the door of the Doctor's room and looking in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) perceived that the shoemaker's bench and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) usual morning dress, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face -LRB-which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see-RRB-, though still very pale, was calmly studious and attentive.
<p/>Even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had satisfied himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was awake, Mr. Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own; for, did not his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes show him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) friend before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had so strong an impression had actually happened?
<p/>It was but the inquiry of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) first confusion and astonishment, the answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), Jarvis Lorry, there?
<p/>How came he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to have fallen asleep, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) clothes, on the sofa in Doctor Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning?
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had had any particle of doubt left, her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) talk would of necessity have resolved it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was by that time clear-headed, and had none.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) appeared to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) customary state of mind, Mr. Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had been, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) anxiety, so anxious to obtain.
<p/>Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) side. Miss Pross, submitting herself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) judgment, the scheme was worked out with care.
<p/>Having abundance of time for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) usual methodical toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) usual white linen, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) usual neat leg.
<p/>So far as it was possible to comprehend him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe advance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) at first supposed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) daughter's marriage had taken place yesterday.
<p/>An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thinking and counting, and evidently made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) uneasy.
<p/>The Doctor was summoned in the usual way, and came to breakfast. In all other respects, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sought.
<p/>Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) and the Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly: <div class="bookquote">``My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>And that aid was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own. Glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands, which were discoloured by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) late work, the Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively.
<p/>Doctor Manette,'' said Mr. Lorry, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) affectionately on the arm, <div class="bookquote">``the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine.
<p/>Pray give your mind to it, and advise me well for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sake--and above all, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) daughter's--his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) daughter's, my dear Manette.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had already glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands more than once. '' '' If I understand,'' said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, <div class="bookquote">``some mental shock--?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Be explicit,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. '' Spare no detail. '' Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.
<p/>My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock, of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings, the--the--as you express it--the mind.
<p/>It is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, because I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) cannot calculate the time himself, and there are no other means of getting at it.
<p/>It is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) cannot trace himself--as I once heard him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) publicly relate in a striking manner.
<p/>It is the case of a shock from which he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stock of knowledge, which was already very large.
<p/>'' The mind. But, unfortunately, there has been,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paused and took a deep breath--<div class="bookquote">``a slight relapse. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, <div class="bookquote">``Of how long duration?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nine days and nights. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did it show itself? I infer,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hands again, <div class="bookquote">``in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, did you ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>asked the Doctor, distinctly and collectedly, though in the same low voice, <div class="bookquote">``engaged in that pursuit originally?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That is the fact.'' <div class="bookquote">``Once.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' And when the relapse fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), was he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) in most respects--or in all respects--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was then?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think in all respects.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter. Does his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter know of the relapse?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No. It has been kept from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and I hope will always be kept from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
<p/>It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted. '' The Doctor grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand, and murmured, <div class="bookquote">``That was very kind.
<p/>That was very thoughtful!''  (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand in return, and neither of the two spoke for a little while.
<p/>Now, my dear Manette,'' said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) most considerate and most affectionate way, <div class="bookquote">``I am a mere man of business, and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>I do not possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of intelligence; I want guiding.
<p/>There is no man in this world on whom I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this relapse come about?
<p/>Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come about at all?
<p/>No man ever can have been more desirous in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine, if I knew how.
<p/>If your sagacity, knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.
<p/>Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly, and teach me how to be a little more useful.
<p/>What can I do for my friend? '' But I don't know how to originate, in such a case. '' Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and Mr. Lorry did not press him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).
<p/>I think it probable,'' said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort, <div class="bookquote">``that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite unforeseen by its subject.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Was it dreaded by him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry ventured to ask. '' Very much. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said it with an involuntary shudder.
<p/>You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer's mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``be sensibly relieved if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand on the Doctor's arm again, after a short silence on both sides, <div class="bookquote">``to what would you refer this attack?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div>returned Doctor Manette, <div class="bookquote">``that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady.
<p/>It is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mind, that those associations would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a particular occasion.
<p/>Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) less able to bear it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Manette/Miss Manette</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) remember what took place in the relapse?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Lorry, with natural hesitation. The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) head, and answered, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``Not at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, as to the future,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>hinted Mr. Lorry. '' As to the future,'' said the Doctor, recovering firmness, <div class="bookquote">``I should have great hope.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), yielding under the pressure of a complicated something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against, and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that the worst was over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) so soon, I should have great hope. '' Well, well! That's good comfort.
<p/>I am thankful!'' said Mr. Lorry. '' I am thankful!'' repeated the Doctor, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) head with reverence. '' There are two other points,'' said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``on which I am anxious to be instructed.
<p/>I may go on?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' You cannot do your friend a better service. '' The Doctor gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things.
<p/>To the first, then. Now, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) do too much?'' <div class="bookquote">``I think not. It may be the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mind, to be always in singular need of occupation.
<p/>The less it was occupied with healthy things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction.
<p/>That may be, in part, natural to it; in part, the result of affliction. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) may have observed himself, and made the discovery.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' You are sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) is not under too great a strain?'' <div class="bookquote">``I think I am quite sure of it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Manette/Miss Manette</b></font>)</div>'' My dear Manette, if he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) were overworked now--'' <div class="bookquote">``My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I do not think,'' said Doctor Manette with the firmness of self-conviction, ``that anything but the one train of association would renew it.
<p/>After what has happened, and after his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think so. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. I trust, and I almost believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assurance out of personal endurance and distress.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>It was not for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend to abate that confidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really was, and approached his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) second and last point.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt it to be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old Sunday morning conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen in the last nine days, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must face it.
<p/>The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from,'' said Mr. Lorry, clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) throat, <div class="bookquote">``we will call--Blacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work.
<p/>We will say, to put a case and for the sake of illustration, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) had been used, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) bad time, to work at a little forge.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>We will say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) was unexpectedly found at his (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) forge again. Is it not a pity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) should keep it by him (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>)?
<p/>'' The Doctor shaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand, and beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) foot nervously on the ground. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) has always kept it by him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>),'' said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) friend.
<p/>'' Now, would it not be better that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) should let it go? '' Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) foot nervously on the ground.
<p/>'' You do not find it easy to advise me?'' said Mr. Lorry. '' I quite understand it to be a nice question.
<p/>You see,'' said Doctor Manette, turning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) after an uneasy pause, <div class="bookquote">``it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings of this poor man's mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) once yearned so frightfully for that occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became more practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reach.
<p/>Even now, when I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is more hopeful of himself than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence, the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might need that old employment, and not find it, gives him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.
<p/>And yet I think--''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and stopped. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) illustration, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes to Mr. Lorry's face.
<p/>I ask for information, as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and bank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea?
<p/>'' But may not--mind! If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the forge?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not keep it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) gained in firmness as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) saw the Doctor disquieted.
<p/>'' There was another silence. '' You see, too,'' said the Doctor, tremulously, <div class="bookquote">``it is such an old companion. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>I would recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good. Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man.
<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter's sake, my dear Manette! '' Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! '' In her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) name, then, let it be done; I sanction it.
<p/>But, I would not take it away while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was present. Let it be removed when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not there; let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) miss his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old companion after an absence.
<p/>'' Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. They passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored.
<p/>On the three following days he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth day he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) went away to join Lucie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband.
<p/>The precaution that had been taken to account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) silence, Mr. Lorry had previously explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had no suspicions.
<p/>On the night of the day on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) left the house, Mr. Lorry went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross carrying a light.
<p/>There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker's bench to pieces, while Miss Pross held the candle as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) were assisting at a murder--for which, indeed, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) grimness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was no unsuitable figure.
<p/>The burning of the body -LRB-previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose-RRB- was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools, shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden.
<p/>So wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross, while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible crime.
<p/>XX. A Plea When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) congratulations, was Sydney Carton.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was not improved in habits, or in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.
<p/>They had not been at home many hours, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) presented himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) when no one overheard.
<p/>'' Mr. Darnay,'' said Carton, <div class="bookquote">``I wish we might be friends. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We are already friends, I hope. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don't mean any fashion of speech.
<p/>Indeed, when I say I wish we might be friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>Charles Darnay--as was natural--asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), in all good-humour and good-fellowship, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) did mean?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div>said Carton, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I find that easier to comprehend in my own mind, than to convey to yours.
<p/>However, let me try. You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than--than usual?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one day, when all days are at an end for me!
<p/>Don't be alarmed; I am not going to preach. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming to me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you try?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have indicated. I thank you, Darnay.
<p/>I may use that freedom with your name?'' <div class="bookquote">``I think so, Carton, by this time. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a problem of carelessness and recklessness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), in short, not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), but as anybody might who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) showed himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) fair young wife; but, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) afterwards joined her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in their own rooms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked.
<p/>Within a minute afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever. '' We are thoughtful to-night!'' said Darnay, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) arm about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>Yes, dearest Charles,'' with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) breast, and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``we are rather thoughtful to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) to-night.''
<p/>'' Indeed, my own? Why so?'' '' That is what you are not to ask me. But I think--I know--he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) does.''

<p/>I would ask you to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) has a heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep wounds in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a painful reflection to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles Darnay, quite astounded, <div class="bookquote">``that I should have done him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) any wrong. I never thought this of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>I fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) is not to be reclaimed; there is scarcely a hope that anything in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) character or fortunes is reparable now.
<p/>'' My husband, it is so. But, I am sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is capable of good things, gentle things, even magnanimous things.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) looked so beautiful in the purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) faith in this lost man, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) husband could have looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was for hours.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) urged, clinging nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) breast, and raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``remember how strong we are in our happiness, and how weak he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) misery!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' And, O my dearest Love! '' The supplication touched him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) home. '' I will always remember it, dear Heart!
<p/>I will remember it as long as I live. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arms.
<p/>If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets, could have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might have cried to the night--and the words would not have parted from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips for the first time-- <div class="bookquote">``God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) sweet compassion!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) husband, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) father, and herself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) old directress and companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of years.
<p/>At first, there were times, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was a perfectly happy young wife, when her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) work would slowly fall from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes would be dimmed.
<p/>For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart too much.
<p/>Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>): doubts, of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) breast.
<p/>Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of footsteps at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) so much, swelled to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes, and broke like waves.
<p/>XXI. Echoing Footsteps A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where the Doctor lived. That time passed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) little Lucie lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) bosom.
<p/>Then, among the advancing echoes, there was the tread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) tiny feet and the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming.
<p/>They came, and the shady house was sunny with a child's laugh, and the Divine friend of children, to whom in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) trouble she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had confided hers, seemed to take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arms, as He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took the child of old, and made it a sacred joy to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together, weaving the service of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) happy influence through the tissue of all their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds.
<p/>Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the plane-tree in the garden!
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) husband's step was strong and prosperous among them; her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) father's firm and equal. Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not harsh nor cruel.
<p/>Even when golden hair, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own, lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, with a radiant smile, <div class="bookquote">``Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!
<p/>those were not tears all of agony that wetted his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) young mother's cheek, as the spirit departed from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) embrace that had been entrusted to it.
<p/>Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath of Heaven.
<p/>Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) life.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Suffer them and forbid them not. They see my Father's face. O Father, blessed words! The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton.
<p/>Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) claimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had once done often.
<p/>And one other thing regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.
<p/>No man ever really loved a woman, lost her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and knew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a wife and a mother, but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) children had a strange sympathy with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--an instinctive delicacy of pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here.
<p/>Carton was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) chubby arms, and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) place with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) grew.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) never came there heated with wine. The little boy had spoken of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), almost at the last. '' Poor Carton!
<p/>Mr. Stryver shouldered his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) way through the law, like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) useful friend in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) wake, like a boat towed astern.
<p/>As the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped life of it.
<p/>But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and stronger in him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made it the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was to lead; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) no more thought of emerging from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) state of lion's jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion.
<p/>Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.
<p/>These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) like three sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to Lucie's husband: delicately saying ``Halloa!
<p/>The polite rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr. Stryver with indignation, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) afterwards turned to account in the training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) was also in the habit of declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) full-bodied wine, on the arts Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to <div class="bookquote">``catch''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>), and on the diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) ``not to be caught.
<p/>Some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) King's Bench familiars, who were occasionally parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) for the latter by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) had told it so often, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) believed it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender's being carried off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.
<p/>These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) little daughter was six years old.
<p/>How near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) heart the echoes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) child's tread came, and those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) own dear father's, always active and self-possessed, and those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) dear husband's, need not be told.
<p/>Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste, was music to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>).
<p/>Nor, how there were echoes all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), sweet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) ears, of the many times her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) more devoted to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) married -LRB-if that could be-RRB- than single, and of the many times her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) that no cares and duties seemed to divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) help to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``What is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?
<p/>Kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for me!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>here are three lumps of bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!'' '' '' But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time.
<p/>And it was now, about little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.
<p/>On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband in the dark window.
<p/>It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place.
<p/>I began to think,'' said Mr. Lorry, pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) brown wig back, <div class="bookquote">``that I should have to pass the night at Tellson's.
<p/>We have been so full of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way to turn.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough.
<p/>There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England.'' <div class="bookquote">``That has a bad look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Darnay-- <div class="bookquote">``A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay?
<p/>Some of us at Tellson's are getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion.
<p/>Yes, but we don't know what reason there is in it. People are so unreasonable! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Still,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Darnay, ``you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sweet temper was soured, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) grumbled, <div class="bookquote">``but I am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration.
<p/>I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without reason.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Where is Manette?'' <div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment. '' You are not going out, I hope?''
<p/>'' No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,'' said the Doctor. '' I don't think I do like, if I may speak my mind.
<p/>I am not fit to be pitted against you to-night. Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? I can't see. '' <div class="bookquote">``Of course, it has been kept for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Thank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?'' '' And sleeping soundly. '' '' That's right; all safe and well!
<p/>I don't know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out all day, and I am not as young as I was!
<p/>Now, come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear the echoes about which you have your theory.
<p/>My tea, my dear! Thank ye. '' <div class="bookquote">``Not a theory; it was a fancy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' A fancy, then, my wise pet,'' said Mr. Lorry, patting her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody's life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in the dark London window.
<p/>Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun.
<p/>A tremendous roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind: all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.
<p/>Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could have told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges, powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise.
<p/>People who could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls.
<p/>'' They are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear them!'' Every pulse and heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.
<p/>As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging circled round Defarge's wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself, already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms, thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.
<p/>Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it. ''
<p/>Keep near to me, Jacques Three,'' cried Defarge; <div class="bookquote">``and do you, Jacques One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can.
<p/>Madame's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe, in place of the usual softer implements, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife.
<p/>Where is my wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eh, well! Here you see me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said madame, composed as ever, but not knitting to-day. '' Where do you go, my wife?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I go,''  (<font color='red'><b>madame</b></font>)</div>said madame, <div class="bookquote">``with you at present. You shall see me at the head of women, by-and-bye.''  (<font color='red'><b>madame</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come, then! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>cried Defarge, in a resounding voice.
<p/>With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on depth, and overflowed the city to that point.
<p/>'' Patriots and friends, we are ready! The Bastille!'' Alarm-bells ringing, drums beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack began.
<p/>Through the fire and through the smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) up against a cannon, and on the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) became a cannonier--Defarge of the wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.
<p/>Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke.
<p/>One drawbridge down! '' Work, comrades all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand
<p/>; in the name of all the Angels or the Devils--which you prefer--work!'' Thus Defarge of the wine-shop, still at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) gun, which had long grown hot.
<p/>'' To me, women! '' cried madame his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``What! We can kill as well as the men when the place is taken!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cannon muskets fire ditch drawbridge walls towers</b></font>)</div><p/>Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers.
<p/>And to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), with a shrill thirsty cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and revenge. Slight displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded.
<p/>Flashing weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys, execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) gun, grown doubly hot by the service of Four fierce hours.
<p/>A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!
<p/>So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) on, that even to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) breath or turn his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) head was as impracticable as if he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) had been struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) was landed in the outer courtyard of the Bastille.
<p/>Jacques Three was nearly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) side; Madame Defarge, still heading some of her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) women, was visible in the inner distance, and her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) knife was in her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) hand.
<p/>There, against an angle of a wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) made a struggle to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>). Everywhere was tumult, exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet furious dumb-show.
<p/>Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, <div class="bookquote">``The Prisoners!''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>was the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an eternity of people, as well as of time and space.
<p/>When the foremost billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed, Defarge laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) strong hand on the breast of one of these men--a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) hand--separated him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) from the rest, and got him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) between himself and the wall.
<p/>'' The Prisoners!'' <div class="bookquote">``The Records!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The secret cells!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' The instruments of torture!'' <div class="bookquote">``The Prisoners!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Show me the North Tower!'' said Defarge.
<p/>'' Quick!'' <div class="bookquote">``I will faithfully,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, <div class="bookquote">``if you will come with me. But there is no one there. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?'' asked Defarge. '' Quick!'' <div class="bookquote">``The meaning, monsieur? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity?
<p/>Or do you mean that I shall strike you dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Kill him (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>)! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.
<p/>Jacques Three, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) usual craving on him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>), and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed, held by Defarge's arm as he (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) held by the turnkey's.
<p/>Their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases.
<p/>All around outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which, occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray.
<p/>Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps, and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three, linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make.
<p/>Here and there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by; but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a tower, they were alone.
<p/>Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.
<p/>The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed in: <div class="bookquote">``One hundred and five, North Tower!
<p/>There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall, with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The turnkey</b></font>)</div>Monsieur, it is a cell.'' <div class="bookquote">``Show it me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Pass this way, then.'' '' There was a small chimney, heavily barred across, a few feet within.
<p/>There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed.
<p/>There were the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them. '' Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,'' said Defarge to the turnkey.
<p/>The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes. '' Stop!--Look here, Jacques!'' <div class="bookquote">``A. M.!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>croaked Jacques Three, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) read greedily.
<p/>'' Alexandre Manette,'' said Defarge in his (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) ear, following the letters with his (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. '' And here he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) wrote 'a poor physician.'
<p/>And it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>), without doubt, who scratched a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) made a sudden exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.
<p/>Give it me!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) had still the linstock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) gun in his (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) own hand. '' Hold the light higher!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) said, wrathfully, to the turnkey.
<p/>'' Look among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,'' throwing it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``rip open that bed, and search the straw.
<p/>With a menacing look at the turnkey he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) crawled upon the hearth, and, peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar, and worked at the iron grating across it.
<p/>In a few minutes, some mortar and dust came dropping down, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) averted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) face to avoid; and in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney into which his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) groped with a cautious touch.
<p/>Hold the light higher, you!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?'' <div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell.
<p/>Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once more.
<p/>So! Light them, you! ''  (<font color='red'><b>The turnkey</b></font>)</div>The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself.
<p/>Saint Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people.
<p/>Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people's blood -LRB-suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness-RRB- be unavenged.
<p/>In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) grey coat and red decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a woman's.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and remained immovable close to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>); remained immovable close to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) through the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) along; remained immovable close to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was got near his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) destination, and began to be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) when the long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) foot upon his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) neck, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) head.
<p/>The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) horrible idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) could be and do.
<p/>Saint Antoine's blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was down--down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the governor's body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation.
<p/>'' cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new means of death; <div class="bookquote">``here is one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) soldiers to be left on guard!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Antoine/Saint Antoine</b></font>)</div><p/>'' See, there is my husband!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, pointing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) out. <div class="bookquote">``See Defarge!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Lower the lamp yonder! The swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.
<p/>The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown.
<p/>The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes, voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.
<p/>But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore more memorable wrecks with it.
<p/>Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits.
<p/>Impassive faces, yet with a suspended--not an abolished--expression on them; faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, <div class="bookquote">``THOU DIDST IT!''
 (<font color='red'><b>bear witness</b></font>)</div><p/>Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken hearts,--such, and such--like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine.
<p/>Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay, and keep these feet far out of her (<font color='blue'><b>escort</b></font>) life!
<p/>For, they are headlong, mad, and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once stained red.
<p/>The Sea Still Rises Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame Defarge sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>escort</b></font>) counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.
<p/>Madame Defarge wore no rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>escort</b></font>) head, for the great brotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint's mercies.
<p/>XXII. The lamps across his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) streets had a portentously elastic swing with them. Madame Defarge, with her (<font color='blue'><b>escort</b></font>) arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street.
<p/>In both, there were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself; but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to destroy life in you?
<p/>Every lean bare arm, that had been without work before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.
<p/>The raggedest nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: ''  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that they could tear.
<p/>There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine; the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.
<p/>Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women.
<p/>The short, rather plump wife of a starved grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.
<p/>As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading murmur came rushing along.
<p/>One of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sisterhood knitted beside her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Hark!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said The Vengeance. '' Listen, then! Who comes? '' '' It is Defarge,'' said madame.
<p/>'' Silence, patriots! '' Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) wore, and looked around him (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>)! '' Listen, everywhere!'' said madame again.
<p/>Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had sprung to their feet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>'' Say then, my husband. What is it?'' <div class="bookquote">``News from the other world!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried madame, contemptuously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The other world? '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Everybody!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from all throats. '' The news is of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is among us!'' <div class="bookquote">``Among us!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from the universal throat again. <div class="bookquote">``And dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not dead!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feared us so much--and with reason--that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) caused himself to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But they have found him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in.
<p/>I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) but now, on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner. I have said that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had reason to fear us.
<p/>Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) had never known it yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) would have known it in his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) heart of hearts if he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) could have heard the answering cry.
<p/>Say all! Had he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) reason? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) wife looked steadfastly at one another.
<p/>The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum was heard as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) moved it at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feet behind the counter.
<p/>Instantly Madame Defarge's knife was in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) girdle; the drum was beating in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to house, rousing the women.
<p/>The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest.
<p/>From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Patriots!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, in a determined voice, <div class="bookquote">``are we ready? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother!
<p/>Then, a score of others ran into the midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon alive!
<p/>Miscreant Foulon taken, my daughter! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon who told my old father that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might eat grass, when I had no bread to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!
<p/>Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these breasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon!
<p/>Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon!
<p/>Husbands, and brothers, and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) into the ground, that grass may grow from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!
<p/>With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy, whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot.
<p/>O Heaven our suffering! Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed.
<p/>Armed men and women flocked out of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children.
<p/>They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets.
<p/>The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance, and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance from him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) in the Hall.
<p/>Never, if Saint Antoine knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! No. <div class="bookquote">``See! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried madame, pointing with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knife. ''
<p/>See the old villain bound with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) back. Ha, ha!
<p/>That was well done. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) eat it now!'' Madame put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knife under her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arm, and clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands as at a play.
<p/>The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands.
<p/>Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl, and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge's frequent expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a telegraph between her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) and the crowd outside the building.
<p/>At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or protection, directly down upon the old prisoner's head.
<p/>The favour was too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>)!
<p/>Defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) hand in one of the ropes with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) was tied--The Vengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city,
<p/>'' Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) knees; now, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) feet; now, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) back; dragged, and struck at, and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of action, with a small clear space about him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) as the people drew one another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) go--as a cat might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) while they made ready, and
<p/>while he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) besought her (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>): the women passionately screeching at him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) killed with grass in his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>Once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) shrieking; twice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.
<p/>Nor was this the end of the day's bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted and danced his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the people's enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard five hundred strong, in cavalry alone.
<p/>Saint Antoine wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) crimes on flaring sheets of paper, seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>)--would have torn him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) out of the breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) head and heart on pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession through the streets.
<p/>It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. ``Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) out! Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) to the lamp! Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children, wailing and breadless.
<p/>Then, the miserable bakers' shops were beset by long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them again in gossip.
<p/>Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in common, afterwards supping at their doors.
<p/>Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them.
<p/>Fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children; and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and hoped.
<p/>It was almost morning, when Defarge's wine-shop parted with its last knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wife, in husky tones, while fastening the door: <div class="bookquote">``At last it is come, my dear!''
 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Eh well! '' returned madame. <div class="bookquote">``Almost. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Saint</b></font>)</div>Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) starved grocer, and the drum was at rest.
<p/>The Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him (<font color='blue'><b>custodian</b></font>) up and had the same speech out of him (<font color='blue'><b>custodian</b></font>) as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint Antoine's bosom.
<p/>There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) poor ignorant soul and his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) poor reduced body together.
<p/>The prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it, but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of them knew what his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not be what he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) was ordered.
<p/>The drum's was the only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. XXIII. Fire Rises Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.
<p/>Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down, dejected, oppressed, and broken.
<p/>Monseigneur -LRB-often a most worthy individual gentleman-RRB- was a national blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose; nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought things to this.
<p/>Habitations, fences, domesticated animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn out. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out!
<p/>Thus it was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable.
<p/>There must be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like it.
<p/>For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it, and had seldom graced it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Monseigneur</b></font>) presence except for the pleasures of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness.
<p/>The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of Monseigneur.
<p/>For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he (<font color='blue'><b>Monseigneur</b></font>) was and to dust he (<font color='blue'><b>Monseigneur</b></font>) must return, being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he (<font color='blue'><b>Monseigneur</b></font>) had for supper and how much more he (<font color='blue'><b>Monseigneur</b></font>) would eat if he (<font color='blue'><b>Monseigneur</b></font>) had it--in these times, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Monseigneur</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Monseigneur</b></font>) eyes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Monseigneur</b></font>) lonely labour, and viewed the prospect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monseigneur</b></font>) would see some rough figure approaching on foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now a frequent presence.
<p/>As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.
<p/>Such a man came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), like a ghost, at noon in the July weather, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could get from a shower of hail.
<p/>The man looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill, and at the prison on the crag.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had identified these objects in what benighted mind he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, in a dialect that was just intelligible:
<p/>No. <div class="bookquote">``How goes it, Jacques?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques/Jacques One</b></font>)</div>'' All well, Jacques.'' <div class="bookquote">``Touch then!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.
<p/>'' No dinner?'' '' Nothing but supper now ,'' said the mender of roads, with a hungry face. '' It is the fashion,'' growled the man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held it from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and dropped something into it from between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger and thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.
<p/>'' I meet no dinner anywhere. '' <div class="bookquote">``Touch then. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time, after observing these operations.
<p/>They again joined hands. '' To-night?'' said the mender of roads. '' To-night,'' said the man, putting the pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.
<p/>'' Where?'' <div class="bookquote">``Here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Show me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the traveller</b></font>)</div>said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill. <div class="bookquote">``See! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the mender of roads, with extended finger.
<p/>'' You go down here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--'' <div class="bookquote">``To the Devil with all that! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>interrupted the other, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) eye over the landscape.
<p/>'' I go through no streets and past no fountains. Well?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. When do you cease to work?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At sunset. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without resting.
<p/>The wayfarer smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) pipe out, put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) breast, slipped off his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) great wooden shoes, and lay down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) back on the heap of stones.
<p/>Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child. Will you wake me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Surely. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) was fast asleep directly.
<p/>As the road-mender plied his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man -LRB-who wore a red cap now, in place of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blue one-RRB-
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were so often turned towards it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.
<p/>The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender of roads with awe.
<p/>The traveller had travelled far, and his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) feet were footsore, and his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) ankles chafed and bleeding; his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) great shoes, stuffed with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues, and his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) clothes were chafed into holes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) himself was into sores.
<p/>Stooping down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), the road-mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) breast or where not; but, in vain, for he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) slept with his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) arms crossed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), and set as resolutely as his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) lips.
<p/>Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against this figure.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) eyes from it to the horizon and looked around, he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) small fancy similar figures, stopped by no obstacle, tending to centres all over France.
<p/>The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness, to sunshine on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face and shadow, to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing.
<p/>Then, the mender of roads having got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tools together and all things ready to go down into the village, roused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones. '' Good! '' said the sleeper, rising on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbow. ''
<p/>The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain, squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and appearing even to whisper to them in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whispering to all the village.
<p/>When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed, as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there.
<p/>A curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only.
<p/>Monsieur Gabelle, chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) house-top alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.
<p/>The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom.
<p/>Up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had slept.
<p/>East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard.
<p/>Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill?'' <div class="bookquote">``About. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About. Good! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The night deepened. Four lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all was black again.
<p/>Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.
<p/>Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front, picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches, and windows were.
<p/>But, not for long. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter. Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.
<p/>A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away.
<p/>There was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur Gabelle's door.
<p/>The mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the sky.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The tocsin rang impatiently, but other help -LRB-if that were any-RRB- there was none. '' It must be forty feet high,'' said they, grimly; and never moved.
<p/>The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on the crag.
<p/>At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire; removed from them, a group of soldiers. '' Help, gentlemen--officers!
<p/>The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting of lips, <div class="bookquote">``It must burn.
<p/>The chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid! Help, help! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldiers</b></font>)</div>'' As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the village was illuminating.
<p/>The mender of roads, and the two hundred and fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass.
<p/>The general scarcity of everything, occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with, and that post-horses would roast.
<p/>In the roaring and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away.
<p/>The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. With the rising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in torment.
<p/>anon struggled out of the smoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake and contending with the fire.
<p/>The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire, scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke.
<p/>When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured: Molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain
<p/>; the water ran dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame.
<p/>Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next destination.
<p/>Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter days--became impatient for an interview with him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>), and, surrounding his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) house, summoned him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) to come forth for personal conference.
<p/>The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy. Whereupon, Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) door, and retire to hold counsel with himself.
<p/>The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) housetop behind his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) stack of chimneys; this time resolved, if his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) door were broken in -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament-RRB-, to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet, and crush a man or two below.
<p/>Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) having an ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) posting-house gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favour.
<p/>A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved!
<p/>But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed, and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for that while.
<p/>Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellows, upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up in their turn.
<p/>But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West, North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.
<p/>The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it, no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate successfully.
<p/>In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore--three years of tempest were consumed.
<p/>Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) home.
<p/>Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet.
<p/>For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted in.
<p/>Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his (<font color='blue'><b>inmates</b></font>) not being appreciated: of his (<font color='blue'><b>inmates</b></font>) being so little wanted in France, as to incur considerable danger of receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>inmates</b></font>) dismissal from it, and this life together.
<p/>Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) could ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after boldly reading the Lord's Prayer backwards for a great number of years, and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no sooner beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) terrors than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) took to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) noble heels.
<p/>The shining Bull's Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets.
<p/>It had never been a good eye to see with--had long had the mote in it of Lucifer's pride, Sardanapalus's luxury, and a mole's blindness--but it had dropped out and was gone.
<p/>The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was all gone together.
<p/>XXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and <div class="bookquote">``suspended,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Loadstone Rock Royalty</b></font>)</div>when the last tidings came over.
<p/>The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.
<p/>Spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his (<font color='blue'><b>Royalty</b></font>) guineas used to be.
<p/>As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank. Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied upon, came quickest.
<p/>Again: those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made provident remittances to Tellson's, were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren.
<p/>To which it must be added that every new-comer from France reported himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>nobles</b></font>) tidings at Tellson's, almost as a matter of course.
<p/>For such variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous, that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran through Temple Bar to read.
<p/>On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) desk, and Charles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in a low voice.
<p/>Again: Tellson's was a munificent house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate. The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing.
<p/>But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,'' said Charles Darnay, rather hesitating, <div class="bookquote">``I must still suggest to you--
<p/>It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I understand. That I am too old?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry.
<p/>Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.''
<p/>My dear Charles,'' said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, <div class="bookquote">``you touch some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away.
<p/>It is safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with.
<p/>As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of old, and is in Tellson's confidence.
<p/>As to the uncertain travelling, the long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson's, after all these years, who ought to be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I wish I were going myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly, and like one thinking aloud. '' Indeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!'' exclaimed Mr. Lorry.
<p/>My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the thought -LRB-which I did not mean to utter here, however-RRB- has passed through my mind often.
<p/>One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) spoke here in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) former thoughtful manner, <div class="bookquote">``that one might be listened to, and might have the power to persuade to some restraint.
<p/>Only last night, after you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When you were talking to Lucie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry repeated.
<p/>'' You wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman born? You are a wise counsellor. '' '' '' Yes.
<p/>I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing you were going to France at this time of day!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``However, I am not going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles Darnay, with a smile. '' It is more to the purpose that you say you are.''
<p/>The truth is, my dear Charles,'' Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved.
<p/>The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow!
<p/>Now, a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise getting of them out of harm's way, is within the power -LRB-without loss of precious time-RRB- of scarcely any one but myself, if any one.
<p/>And shall I hang back, when Tellson's knows this and says this--Tellson's, whose bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about the joints?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>House</b></font>)</div>And I am, in plain reality. Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!'' <div class="bookquote">``How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles,'' said Mr. Lorry, glancing at the House again, <div class="bookquote">``you are to remember, that getting things out of Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an impossibility.
<p/>Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here -LRB-I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to whisper it, even to you-RRB-, by the strangest bearers you can imagine, every one of whom had his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head hanging on by a single hair as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) passed the Barriers.
<p/>At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped.''
 (<font color='red'><b>House</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tut! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And do you really go to-night?'' <div class="bookquote">``I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And do you take no one with you?'' '' All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing to say to any of them.
<p/>I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>).
<p/>Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or of having any design in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) head but to fly at anybody who touches his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) master.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this little commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson's proposal to retire and live at my ease.
<p/>This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry's usual desk, with Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long.
<p/>It was too much the way of Monseigneur under his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) reverses as a refugee, and it was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sown--
<p/>as if nothing had ever been done, or omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming, years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw.
<p/>Such vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself, and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth.
<p/>And it was such vapouring all about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) so.
<p/>Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching to Monseigneur, his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.
<p/>The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed?
<p/>The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own right name.
<p/>Time enough, then, to think about growing old. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The address, turned into English, ran: <div class="bookquote">``Very pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of France.

<p/>Nobody else knew it to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) name; his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own wife had no suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.
<p/>No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; <div class="bookquote">``I have referred it, I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found.
<p/>The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry's desk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That, and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.

<p/>'' Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) though? Is that the sort of fellow? Let us look at his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) infamous name. D--n the fellow! ''
<p/>Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on the shoulder, and said: <div class="bookquote">``I know the fellow.

<p/>Well, but I'll answer you. I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. That's why. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and said: <div class="bookquote">``You may not understand the gentleman.''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I understand how to put you in a corner, Mr. Darnay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bully Stryver, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll do it.
<p/>You may also tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), from me, that after abandoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob, I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) is not at the head of them.
<p/>But, no, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) fingers, <div class="bookquote">``I know something of human nature, and I tell you that you'll never find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such precious protégés .

No, gentlemen; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'ll always show 'em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.
<p/>With those words, and a final snap of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fingers, Mr. Stryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stryver</b></font>) hearers.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Stryver/Stryver</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk, in the general departure from the Bank. '' Will you take charge of the letter?'' said Mr. Lorry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and that it has been here some time?''

<p/>After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and brought a long journey on foot to Paris.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>June 21, 1792. '' MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS. '' On the road I have suffered a great deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the ground.
<p/>The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my life -LRB-without your so generous help-RRB-, is, they tell me, treason against the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an emigrant.
<p/>'' It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not against, according to your commands. It is in vain
<p/>I represent that, before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had had recourse to no process.
<p/>The only response is, that I have acted for an emigrant, and where is that emigrant? '' Ah! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that emigrant?
<p/>I cry in my sleep where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)? I demand of Heaven , will he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) not come to deliver me? No answer.

<p/>For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to succour and release me.
<p/>Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , I pray you be you true to me!
<p/>I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.
<p/>'' From this prison here of horror, whence '' Your afflicted, <div class="bookquote">``Gabelle. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter.
<p/>The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) family, stared him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) so reproachfully in the face, that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) almost hid his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) face from the passersby.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knew very well, that in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) resentful suspicions of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) uncle, and in the aversion with which his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was supposed to uphold, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had acted imperfectly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knew very well, that in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) love for Lucie, his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) renunciation of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) social place, though by no means new to his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own mind, had been hurried and incomplete.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had meant to do it, and that it had never been done.
<p/>The happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own chosen English home, the necessity of being always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week following made all new again; he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knew very well, that to the force of these circumstances he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had yielded:--not without disquiet, but still without continuous and accumulating resistance.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had watched the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out, was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that might impeach him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) for it.
<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had oppressed no man, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had imprisoned no man; he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) dues, that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had relinquished them of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own will, thrown himself on a world with no favour in it, won his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own private place there, and earned his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own bread.
<p/>Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer--and no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had put the fact in plea and proof, for his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own safety, so that it could not but appear now.
<p/>Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to itself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) must go.
<p/>This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) would go to Paris. Yes. Everything that arose before his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) mind drifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible attraction.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being worked out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) who could not fail to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was better than they, was not there, trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy and humanity.
<p/>With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison -LRB-injurious to himself-RRB- had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur, which had stung him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were coarse and galling, for old reasons.
<p/>Upon those, had followed Gabelle's letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) justice, honour, and good name.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) resolution was made. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) must go to Paris. Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) must sail on, until he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) struck.
<p/>The intention with which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had done what he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had done, even although he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had left it incomplete, presented it before him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in France on his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) presenting himself to assert it.
<p/>Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) walked to and fro with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) resolution made, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) considered that neither Lucie nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father must know of it until he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was gone.
<p/>Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father, always reluctant to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old, should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in the balance of suspense and doubt.
<p/>How much of the incompleteness of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) situation was referable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father, through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not discuss with himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew of no rock; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw hardly any danger. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) course.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) arrived in Paris he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) would present himself to this old friend, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) must say nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) intention now.
<p/>A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was booted and equipped. '' I have delivered that letter,'' said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry.
<p/>'' I would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I will, and readily,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``if it is not dangerous. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What is his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) name?'' said Mr. Lorry, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) open pocket-book in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand. '' Gabelle.'' <div class="bookquote">``Gabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Simply, `that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) has received the letter, and will come.'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Any time mentioned?'' <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) will start upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) journey to-morrow night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks, and went out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the misty air of Fleet-street.
<p/>My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,'' said Mr. Lorry at parting, <div class="bookquote">``and take precious care of them till I come back.
<p/>That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was under to go to Paris, and showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), at length, the reasons that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had, for feeling confident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and their dear child to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances.

To both, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) wrote that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) would despatch letters in proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) safety, immediately after his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) arrival.
<p/>It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first reservation of their joint lives on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) mind.
<p/>But, an affectionate glance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) wife, so happy and busy, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) resolute not to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) what impended -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had been half moved to do it, so strange it was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) to act in anything without her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) quiet aid-RRB-, and the day passed quickly.
<p/>Early in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) would return by-and-bye -LRB-an imaginary engagement took him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had secreted a valise of clothes ready-RRB-, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets, with a heavier heart.
<p/>The unseen force was drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) fast to itself, now, and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) journey.
<p/>For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name!'' was the poor prisoner's cry with which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) strengthened his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) sinking heart, as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) left all that was dear on earth behind him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and floated away for the Loadstone Rock.
<p/>It was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious. '' The end of the second book.
<p/>The traveller fared slowly on his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) way, who fared towards Paris from England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two.
<p/>More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad horses, he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) would have encountered to delay him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) throne in all his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) glory; but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these.
<p/>Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them, inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own, turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.
<p/>A very few French leagues of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) journey were accomplished, when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) along these country roads there was no hope of return until he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) should have been declared a good citizen at Paris.
<p/>Book the Third--the Track of a Storm I. In Secret Whatever might befall now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) must on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) journey's end.
<p/>Not a mean village closed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) and England.
<p/>The universal watchfulness so encompassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had been taken in a net, or were being forwarded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) destination in a cage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) could not have felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) freedom more completely gone.
<p/>This universal watchfulness not only stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) on the highway twenty times in a stage, but retarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) progress twenty times in a day, by riding after him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) back, riding before him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) and stopping him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) by anticipation, riding with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) and keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in charge.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had been days upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) journey in France alone, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) went to bed tired out, in a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.
<p/>Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) prison of the Abbaye would have got him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) on so far.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) difficulty at the guard-house in this small place had been such, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) journey to have come to a crisis.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was, therefore, as little surprised as a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.
<p/>Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.
<p/>'' Emigrant,'' said the functionary, <div class="bookquote">``I am going to send you on to Paris, under an escort.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emigrant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could dispense with the escort.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) musket. '' Peace, aristocrat!'' <div class="bookquote">``It is as the good patriot says,''  (<font color='red'><b>the functionary</b></font>)</div>observed the timid functionary.
<p/>'' You are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it. '' <div class="bookquote">``I have no choice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>said Charles Darnay.
<p/>'' Choice! Listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)! '' cried the same scowling red-cap. '' As if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!''
<p/>Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by a watch-fire.
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) paid a heavy price for his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) escort, and hence he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o'clock in the morning.
<p/>The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).
<p/>The escorted governed his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) own horse, but a loose line was attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) wrist.
<p/>In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement, and out upon the mire-deep roads.
<p/>In this state they traversed without change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay between them and the capital.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is always as the good patriot says,''  (<font color='red'><b>the functionary</b></font>)</div>observed the functionary. '' Rise and dress yourself, emigrant. '' They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and lying by until the twilight fell.
<p/>The escort were so wretchedly clothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off.
<p/>Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) to awaken any serious fears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) breast; for, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations, confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.
<p/>But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide, when the streets were filled with people--he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming.
<p/>An ominous crowd gathered to see him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called out loudly, <div class="bookquote">``Down with the emigrant!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) saddle, and, resuming it as his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) safest place, said: ``Emigrant, my friends!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a cursed emigrant,''  (<font color='red'><b>a farrier</b></font>)</div>cried a farrier, making at him (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) in a furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; ``and you are a cursed aristocrat!
<p/>The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's bridle -LRB-at which he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) was evidently making-RRB-, and soothingly said, <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) be; let him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) be!
<p/>Do you not see me here, in France, of my own will?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) will be judged at Paris.'' <div class="bookquote">``Judged!''  (<font color='red'><b>the farrier</b></font>)</div>repeated the farrier, swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) hammer.
<p/>Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) horse's head to the yard -LRB-the drunken patriot sat composedly in his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) saddle looking on, with the line round his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) wrist-RRB-, Darnay said, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) could make his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) voice heard: <div class="bookquote">``Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ay! and condemned as a traitor. '' At this the crowd roared approval. I am not a traitor.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) lies!'' cried the smith.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) is a traitor since the decree. His (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) life is forfeit to the people. His (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) cursed life is not his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) own!''
<p/>At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which another instant would have brought upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), the postmaster turned his (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) horse's flanks, and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates.
<p/>The farrier struck a blow upon them with his (<font color='blue'><b>farrier</b></font>) hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no more was done. '' What is this decree that the smith spoke of?
<p/>'' Darnay asked the postmaster, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), and stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) in the yard. '' Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and condemning all to death who return.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' When passed?'' <div class="bookquote">``On the fourteenth.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' The day I left England!'' That is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) meant when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) said your life was not your own.''
<p/>'' But there are no such decrees yet? '' '' What do I know!'' said the postmaster, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>) shoulders; <div class="bookquote">``there may be, or there will be.
<p/>They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep.
<p/>Among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep.
<p/>After long and lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night, circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song.
<p/>Happily, however, there was sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.
<p/>It is all the same. What would you have? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the postmaster</b></font>)</div>Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.
<p/>'' Where are the papers of this prisoner? '' demanded a resolute-looking man in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.
<p/>Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was a free traveller and French citizen, in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had paid for.
<p/>'' Where,'' repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) whatever, <div class="bookquote">``are the papers of this prisoner? ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The drunken patriot had them in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) cap, and produced them.
<p/>Casting his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) eyes over Gabelle's letter, the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the gate.
<p/>Looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) while in this state of suspense, Charles Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress into the city for peasants' carts bringing in supplies, and for similar traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest people, was very difficult.
<p/>A numerous medley of men and women, not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they filtered through the barrier very slowly.
<p/>Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered about.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) had sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) saddle some half-hour, taking note of these things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority, who directed the guard to open the barrier.
<p/>The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men and women. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) delivered to the escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) to dismount.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) accompanied his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake, drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about.
<p/>The light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly uncertain condition.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) did so, and the two patriots, leading his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) tired horse, turned and rode away without entering the city. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.
<p/>'' Citizen Defarge,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) to Darnay's conductor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) took a slip of paper to write on. <div class="bookquote">``Is this the emigrant Evremonde?''
 (<font color='red'><b>This the man</b></font>)</div><p/>'' This is the man. '' '' Your age, Evremonde?'' <div class="bookquote">``Thirty-seven.''  (<font color='red'><b>Evremonde/Marquis St. Evremonde</b></font>)</div>'' Married, Evremonde?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where married? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In England. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' In England. '' <div class="bookquote">``Without doubt. You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of La Force.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just Heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Darnay. '' Under what law, and for what offence? '' The officer looked up from his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) slip of paper for a moment.
<p/>'' We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.
<p/>I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you.
<p/>'' I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that my right?'' <div class="bookquote">``Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the stolid reply.
<p/>The officer wrote until he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had finished, read over to himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had written, sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In secret. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) must accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, <div class="bookquote">``who married the daughter of Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Darnay/Charles Darnay/Charles</b></font>)</div>replied Darnay, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) with surprise. '' My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint Antoine.
<p/>The word <div class="bookquote">``wife''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say with sudden impatience, <div class="bookquote">``In the name of that sharp female newly-born, and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/>Possibly you have heard of me.'' '' My wife came to your house to reclaim her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father? Yes!'' <div class="bookquote">``You heard me say why, a minute ago.
<p/>Do you not believe it is the truth?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A bad truth for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>'' Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost.
<p/>Will you render me a little help?'' <div class="bookquote">``None. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). '' Will you answer me a single question?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free communication with the world outside?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will see.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of presenting my case?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will see.
<p/>But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons, before now.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' But never by me, Citizen Defarge.
<p/>The deeper he (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) sank into this silence, the fainter hope there was--or so Darnay thought--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) softening in any slight degree.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), therefore, made haste to say: <div class="bookquote">``It is of the utmost importance to me -LRB-you know, Citizen, even better than I, of how much importance-RRB-, that I should be able to communicate to Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris, the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the prison of La Force.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Defarge glanced darkly at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for answer, and walked on in a steady and set silence. Will you cause that to be done for me?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Defarge doggedly rejoined, <div class="bookquote">``nothing for you. My duty is to my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against you.
<p/>I will do nothing for you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) further, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) pride was touched besides.
<p/>As they walked on in silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets.
<p/>A few passers turned their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) as an aristocrat; otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work.
<p/>In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal family.
<p/>The few words that he (<font color='blue'><b>royal</b></font>) caught from this man's lips, first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris.
<p/>The very children scarcely noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>). On the road -LRB-except at Beauvais-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) left England, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of course knew now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) could not but admit to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) might not have made this journey, if he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) could have foreseen the events of a few days.
<p/>That perils had thickened about him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fast, and might thicken faster and faster yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of course knew now. And yet his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by the light of this later time, they would appear.
<p/>The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away.
<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``sharp female newly-born, and called La Guillotine,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was hardly known to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), or to the generality of people, by name.
<p/>The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers.
<p/>Troubled as the future was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope. How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?
<p/>Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation from his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wife and child, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) foreshadowed the likelihood, or the certainty; but, beyond this, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) dreaded nothing distinctly.
<p/>With this on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) arrived at the prison of La Force.
<p/>A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge presented <div class="bookquote">``The Emigrant Evremonde.''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What the Devil! How many more of them!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the man with the bloated face.
<p/>Defarge took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two fellow-patriots. '' What the Devil, I say again!
<p/>'' exclaimed the gaoler, left with his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) wife. '' How many more! '' The gaoler's wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely replied, <div class="bookquote">``One must have patience, my dear!''
 (<font color='red'><b>gaoler wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, <div class="bookquote">``For the love of Liberty;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion.
<p/>The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it.
<p/>Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for! ''
<p/>In secret, too,'' grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. '' As if I was not already full to bursting!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) subordinates.
<p/>Through the dismal prison twilight, his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) new charge accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) by corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them, until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with prisoners of both sexes.
<p/>The women were seated at a long table, reading and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the chief</b></font>)</div>said the chief, at length taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) keys, <div class="bookquote">``come with me, emigrant. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the chief</b></font>)</div>In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company.
<p/>But the crowning unreality of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.
<p/>So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead.
<p/>The ghost of beauty, the ghost of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.
<p/>The gaoler standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) side, and the other gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its utmost.
<p/>Ghosts all! It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) motionless. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) to these gloomy shades! ''
<p/>In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,'' said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, <div class="bookquote">``I have the honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us.
<p/>May it soon terminate happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here, to ask your name and condition?
<p/>But I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes, who moved across the room, <div class="bookquote">``that you are not in secret?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the chief gaoler</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in words as suitable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) could find. '' <div class="bookquote">``I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But take courage; several members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted but a short time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) added, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``I grieve to inform the society--in secret.
<p/>There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), and many voices--among which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) good wishes and encouragement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) turned at the grated door, to render the thanks of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) heart; it closed under the gaoler's hand; and the apparitions vanished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) sight forever.
<p/>When they had ascended forty steps -LRB-the prisoner of half an hour already counted them-RRB-, the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a solitary cell.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark. '' Yours,'' said the gaoler.
<p/>'' Why am I confined alone?'' <div class="bookquote">``How do I know!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can buy pen, ink, and paper?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Such are not my orders.
<p/>You will be visited, and can ask then. At present, you may buy your food, and nothing more. '' There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress.
<p/>As the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water.
<p/>When the gaoler was gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought in the same wandering way, ``Now am I left, as if I were dead.
<p/>Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned from it with a sick feeling, and thought, <div class="bookquote">``And here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half.
<p/>The prisoner walked to and fro in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) cell, counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) made shoes, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) made shoes, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) made shoes. '' The prisoner counted the measurement again, and paced faster, to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) mind with him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) from that latter repetition.
<p/>There was one among them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the embrasure of a window, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a light shining upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) golden hair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked like
<p/>'' The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. * * * * Let us ride on again, for God's sake, through the illuminated villages with the people all awake!
<p/>* * * * He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made shoes, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made shoes, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and a half.
<p/>With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knew, in the swell that rose above them.
<p/>The Grindstone Tellson's Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate.
<p/>The house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) made a flight from the troubles, in his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) own cook's dress, and got across the borders.
<p/>A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) was still in his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question.
<p/>Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) high wages, by being more than ready and willing to cut his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur's house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated.
<p/>For, all things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneur's house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were drinking brandy in its state apartments.
<p/>A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris, would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.
<p/>For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid over the counter?
<p/>Tellson's had whitewashed the Cupid, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest linen, aiming -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) very often does-RRB- at money from morning to night.
<p/>Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest provocation.
<p/>Yet, a French Tellson's could get on with these things exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had taken fright at them, and drawn out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money.
<p/>What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth, and what would lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellson's hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons, and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with Tellson's never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis Lorry could, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) thought heavily of these questions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) sat by a newly-lighted wood fire -LRB-the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold-RRB-, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) occupied rooms in the Bank, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) fidelity to the House of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy.
<p/>It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that.
<p/>On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade, was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood.
<p/>Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy, or other workshop.
<p/>Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) seat by the fire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had closed both again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shivered through his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) frame.
<p/>From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to Heaven.
<p/>Thank God,'' said Mr. Lorry, clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>II. Yet such things were. All such circumstances were indifferent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) duty. '' May He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) have mercy on all who are in danger!''
<p/>But, there was no loud irruption into the courtyard, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had expected, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) heard the gate clash again, and all was quiet.
<p/>The nervousness and dread that were upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally awaken, with such feelings roused.
<p/>It was well guarded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) door suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) fell back in amazement.
<p/>Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``They have come back!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and sat listening. Lucie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father!
<p/>Lucie with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) arms stretched out to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) life.
<p/>'' What is this?'' cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. '' What is the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here?
<p/>With the look fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) paleness and wildness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) panted out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arms, imploringly, <div class="bookquote">``O my dear friend!
<p/>What is it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>My husband!'' '' Your husband, Lucie?'' <div class="bookquote">``Charles. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What of Charles?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here.

<p/>Almost at the same moment, the bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. '' What is that noise?'' said the Doctor, turning towards the window. ''
<p/>Don't look!'' cried Mr. Lorry. '' Don't look out! Manette, for your life, don't touch the blind!'' The Doctor turned, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand upon the fastening of the window, and said, with a cool, bold smile:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris?
<p/>In France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.
<p/>My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here.
<p/>I knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I told Lucie so.--What is that noise?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand was again upon the window. '' Don't look!'' cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. '' No, Lucie, my dear, nor you!
<p/>I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) being in this fatal place.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>). '' Don't be so terrified, my love. What prison is he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in?''
<p/>Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or I can say.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``La Force!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``La Force! There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night; you cannot possibly stir out.
<p/>I say this, because what I must bid you to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest thing to do of all.
<p/>You must instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a room at the back here.
<p/>You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not delay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do nothing else than this.
<p/>The old man kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), and hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room, and turned the key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and partly opened the blind, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand upon the Doctor's arm, and looked out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) into the courtyard.
<p/>Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all.
<p/>The people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.
<p/>The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.
<p/>False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep.
<p/>As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire.
<p/>I know you are true. ''  (<font color='red'><b>workers work</b></font>)</div>But, such awful workers, and such awful work! The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood.
<p/>Shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through.
<p/>Some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour.
<p/>And as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.
<p/>All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it were there.
<p/>Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharpened, were all red with it. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for explanation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) friend's ashy face.
<p/>If you are sure of what you say; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force.
<p/>'' They are,'' Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at the locked room, ``murdering the prisoners. It may be too late, I don't know, but let it not be a minute later!
<p/>Doctor Manette pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room, and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) streaming white hair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) remarkable face, and the impetuous confidence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) manner, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) put the weapons aside like water, carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.
<p/>For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and the unintelligible sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with cries of--<div class="bookquote">``Live the Bastille prisoner!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>Help for the Bastille prisoner's kindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!'' and a thousand answering shouts.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) child and Miss Pross with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>); but, it never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew.
<p/>Miss Pross had laid the child down on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own bed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) pretty charge.
<p/>Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feet, clinging to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife!
<p/>Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.
<p/>And O the long, long night, with no return of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father and no tidings! '' What is it? '' cried Lucie, affrighted.
<p/>'' Hush! The soldiers' swords are sharpened there,'' said Mr. Lorry. '' The place is national property now, and used as a kind of armoury, my love.
<p/>Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) softly detached himself from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again.
<p/>A man, so besmeared that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone, and looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) with a vacant air.
<p/>Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle, climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) rest on its dainty cushions.
<p/>'' Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful. The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again, and the sun was red on the courtyard.
<p/>But, the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had never given, and would never take away.
<p/>The Shadow One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr. Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had no right to imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the Bank roof.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own possessions, safety, life, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would have hazarded for Lucie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) child, without a moment's demur; but the great trust he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) held was not his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own, and as to that business charge he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was a strict man of business.
<p/>At first, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) mind reverted to Defarge, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) thought of finding out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city.
<p/>But, the same consideration that suggested him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), repudiated him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) lived in the most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in its dangerous workings.
<p/>III. Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute's delay tending to compromise Tellson's, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) said that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that Quarter, near the Banking-house.
<p/>As there was no business objection to this, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) were to be released, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.
<p/>To this lodging he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) at once removed Lucie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) child, and Miss Pross: giving them what comfort he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could, and much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own occupations.
<p/>A disturbed and doleful mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) brought to bear upon them, and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was again alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) room of the previous night, considering what to do next, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) heard a foot upon the stair.
<p/>In a few moments, a man stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name.
<p/>It wore itself out, and wore him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out with it, until the Bank closed. '' Your servant,'' said Mr. Lorry. ''
<p/>Do you know me? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five to fifty years of age.
<p/>For answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) repeated, without any change of emphasis, the words: <div class="bookquote">``Do you know me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have seen you somewhere.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps at my wine-shop?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: <div class="bookquote">``You come from Doctor Manette?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. I come from Doctor Manette.'' ''
<p/>And what says he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)? What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) send me? '' Defarge gave into his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) anxious hand, an open scrap of paper.
<p/>It bore the words in the Doctor's writing: <div class="bookquote">``Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet. I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note from Charles to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife.
<p/>Let the bearer see his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>It was dated from La Force, within an hour. '' Will you accompany me,'' said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud, <div class="bookquote">``to where his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wife resides?
<p/>Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hat and they went down into the courtyard.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>returned Defarge. There, they found two women; one, knitting. '' Madame Defarge, surely!'' said Mr. Lorry, who had left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago.
<p/>'' It is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),'' observed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband. '' Does Madame go with us? '' inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) moved as they moved.
<p/>'' Yes. That she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons. It is for their safety. ''
<p/>Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being The Vengeance.
<p/>They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might, ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry, and found Lucie weeping, alone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was thrown into a transport by the tidings Mr. Lorry gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband, and clasped the hand that delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) note--little thinking what it had been doing near him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).
<p/>'' DEAREST,--Take courage. I am well, and your father has influence around me. You cannot answer this. Kiss our child for me.
<p/>It was so much, however, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) who received it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) turned from Defarge to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife, and kissed one of the hands that knitted.
<p/>It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took to its knitting again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) stopped in the act of putting the note in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) bosom, and, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hands yet at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge.
<p/>'' That was all the writing. There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.
<p/>My dear,'' said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; <div class="bookquote">``there are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) may know them--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) may identify them.
<p/>I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) more and more, <div class="bookquote">``I state the case, Citizen Defarge?
<p/>You had better, Lucie,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry, doing all he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could to propitiate, by tone and manner, <div class="bookquote">``have the dear child here, and our good Pross.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Defarge looked gloomily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wife, and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence. '' Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French.
<p/>The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was more than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance, whom her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes first encountered, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I am sure, Boldface!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>any foreigner</b></font>)</div>I hope you are pretty well! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) also bestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>Is that his (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) child?'' said Madame Defarge, stopping in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) work for the first time, and pointing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate.
<p/>The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and held her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) breast.
<p/>The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.
<p/>'' '' Yes, madame,'' answered Mr. Lorry; <div class="bookquote">``this is our poor prisoner's darling daughter, and only child. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' It is enough, my husband,'' said Madame Defarge.
<p/>But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress: <div class="bookquote">``You will be good to my poor husband.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>I have seen them. We may go. '' You will do him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) no harm. You will help me to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) if you can?''
<p/>'' Your husband is not my business here,'' returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) with perfect composure. '' It is the daughter of your father who is my business here.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) will put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hands together and pray you to be merciful.
<p/>We are more afraid of you than of these others. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband.
<p/>Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thumb-nail and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), collected his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face into a sterner expression. '' What is it that your husband says in that little letter?'' asked Madame Defarge, with a lowering smile.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``That my father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) breast, but with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) alarmed eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) questioner and not on it, <div class="bookquote">``has much influence around him (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>).

<p/>Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) friend The Vengeance: <div class="bookquote">``The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered?
<p/>As a wife and mother! ''  (<font color='red'><b>friend Vengeance</b></font>)</div>We have known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them, often enough?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have seen nothing else,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned The Vengeance. '' We have borne this a long time,'' said Madame Defarge, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes again upon Lucie.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now? ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knitting and went out.
<p/>The Vengeance followed. Defarge went last, and closed the door. '' Courage, my dear Lucie,'' said Mr. Lorry, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>).
<p/>'' Courage, courage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls.

''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lorry; <div class="bookquote">``what is this despondency in the brave little breast?
<p/>But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself, for all that, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) secret mind it troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) greatly.
<p/>A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>IV. Calm in Storm Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) absence.
<p/>So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), that not until long afterwards, when France and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) were far apart, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had been tainted by the slain.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.
<p/>To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) through a scene of carnage to the prison of La Force.
<p/>That, in the prison he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred, or to be released, or -LRB-in a few cases-RRB- to be sent back to their cells.
<p/>That, presented by his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) conductors to this Tribunal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and that this man was Defarge.
<p/>That, hereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ascertained, through the registers on the table, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard to the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life and liberty.
<p/>That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded to him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and examined.
<p/>That, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) seemed on the point of being at once released, when the tide in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) favour met with some unexplained check -LRB-not intelligible to the Doctor-RRB-, which led to a few words of secret conference.
<p/>That, the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) sake, be held inviolate in safe custody.
<p/>That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), the Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had obtained the permission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.
<p/>The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved, had astounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces.
<p/>One prisoner there was, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said, who had been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) passed out.
<p/>Being besought to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) and dress the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies of their victims.
<p/>With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and escorted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.
<p/>As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) watched the face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) that such dread experiences would revive the old danger.
<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had never seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) friend in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) present aspect: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had never at all known him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) present character.
<p/>The sights he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals, shall remain untold. For the first time the Doctor felt, now, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) suffering was strength and power.
<p/>For the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) felt that in that sharp fire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter's husband, and deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).
<p/>As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); by the aid of Heaven I will do it!''
<p/>And when Jarvis Lorry saw the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to have been stopped, like a clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed.
<p/>'' It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin. Thus, Doctor Manette. Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would have yielded before his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) persevering purpose.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) kept himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) used his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) personal influence so wisely, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons, and among them of La Force.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) could now assure Lucie that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the general body of prisoners; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband weekly, and brought sweet messages to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), straight from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips; sometimes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband himself sent a letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) -LRB-though never by the Doctor's hand-RRB-, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was not permitted to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>): for, among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.
<p/>This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.
<p/>The Doctor knew, that up to that time, his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) friend, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.
<p/>Now that this was changed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's ultimate safety and deliverance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) became so far exalted by the change, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as the strong.
<p/>The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) who had rendered so much to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).
<p/>All curious to see,'' thought Mr. Lorry, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) amiably shrewd way, <div class="bookquote">``but all natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn't be in better hands.
<p/>Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) observed it as a curiosity. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) brought to trial, the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).
<p/>The new era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France, as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.
<p/>What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above, and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!
<p/>Though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other count of time there was none.
<p/>Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient.
<p/>Now, breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.
<p/>And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast.
<p/>A revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.
<p/>Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the sharp female called La Guillotine.
<p/>It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache, it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack.
<p/>There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no measurement of time. It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race.
<p/>Models of it were worn on breasts from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and believed in where the Cross was denied.
<p/>It superseded the Cross. It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted, were a rotten red.
<p/>It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it.
<p/>It hushed the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one dead
<p/>The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) was stronger than his (<font color='blue'><b>functionary</b></font>) namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God's own Temple every day.
<p/>Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked with a steady head: confident in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) power, cautiously persistent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) end, never doubting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) would save Lucie's husband at last.
<p/>Yet the current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident.
<p/>had the Revolution grown in that December month, that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun.
<p/>, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes. So much more wicked and distracted Still, the Doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head.
<p/>No man better known than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in Paris at that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable in hospital and prison, using his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) art equally among assassins and victims, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man apart.
<p/>In the exercise of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skill, the appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from all other men.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were a Spirit moving among mortals.
<p/>During all that time Lucie was never sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband's head next day.
<p/>V. The Wood-Sawyer One year and three months. Every day, through the stony streets, the tumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned.
<p/>Lovely girls; bright women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons, and carried to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) through the streets to slake her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) devouring thirst.
<p/>If the suddenness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time, had stunned the Doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair, it would but have been with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as it was with many.
<p/>But, from the hour when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had taken the white head to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fresh young bosom in the garret of Saint Antoine, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been true to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) duties.
<p/>Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;--the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine! She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good will always be.
<p/>As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father had entered on the routine of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) avocations, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arranged the little household as exactly as if her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband had been there.
<p/>Everything had its appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) taught, as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home.
<p/>The slight devices with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunited--the little preparations for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) speedy return, the setting aside of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) chair and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) books--these, and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only outspoken reliefs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) heavy mind.
<p/>The plain dark dresses, akin to mourning dresses, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) child wore, were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) colour, and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional, thing; otherwise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) remained very pretty and comely.
<p/>Sometimes, at night on kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) would burst into the grief she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had repressed all day, and would say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) sole reliance, under Heaven, was on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always resolutely answered: ``Nothing can happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), Lucie.
<p/>They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), on coming home one evening:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) can get to it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) might see you in the street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can show you.
<p/>But you will not be able to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), my poor child, and even if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did not greatly alter in appearance. '' <div class="bookquote">``O show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>From that time, in all weathers, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) waited there two hours. As the clock struck two, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was there, and at four she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) turned resignedly away.
<p/>When it was not too wet or inclement for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) child to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), they went together; at other times she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was alone; but, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) never missed a single day.
<p/>The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that end; all else was wall.
<p/>It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. On the third day of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) being there, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>'' Good day, citizeness.'' <div class="bookquote">``Good day, citizen. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots; but, was now law for everybody.
<p/>The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had once been a mender of roads-RRB-, cast a glance at the prison, pointed at the prison, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ten fingers before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face to represent bars, peeped through them jocosely.
<p/>'' Walking here again, citizeness?'' <div class="bookquote">``You see me, citizen!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' But it's not my business,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>). And went on sawing his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) wood.
<p/>Next day he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) was looking out for her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and accosted her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared. '' What? Walking here again, citizeness?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, citizen. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do I say yes, mamma? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>).
<p/>'' Yes, dearest. '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, citizen. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! But it's not my business. My work is my business. See my saw!
<p/>I call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) head comes! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The billet fell as he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) spoke, and he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) threw it into a basket.
<p/>'' I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. See here again! Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head comes!
<p/>Lucie shuddered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) threw two more billets into his (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) basket, but it was impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) sight.
<p/>Now, a child. Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off its head comes. All the family! '' Thenceforth, to secure his (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) good will
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had quite forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) heart up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) would come to herself to find him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knee on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bench and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw stopped in its work.
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) always spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) first, and often gave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) drink-money, which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) readily received. '' But it's not my business!
<p/>In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at this place; and every day on leaving it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) kissed the prison wall.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would generally say at those times, and would briskly fall to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sawing again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) -LRB-so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) learned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father-RRB-
<p/>it might be once in five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not for a week or a fortnight together.
<p/>It was enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could and did see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) when the chances served, and on that possibility she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) would have waited out the day, seven days a week.
<p/>These occupations brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) round to the December month, wherein her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On a lightly-snowing afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) arrived at the usual corner.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had seen the houses, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription -LRB-tricoloured letters were the favourite-RRB-, Republic One and Indivisible.
<p/>It was a day of some wild rejoicing, and a festival. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death! The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) house-top, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) displayed pike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had stationed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) saw inscribed as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Little Sainte Guillotine'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had got somebody to scrawl it up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), however, who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriate difficulty. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) shop was shut and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) quite alone.
<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was not far off, for presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along, which filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) with fear.
<p/>A moment afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with The Vengeance.
<p/>There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music than their own singing.
<p/>They danced to the popular Revolution song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison. Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced together, as hazard had brought them together.
<p/>At first, they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them.
<p/>They advanced, retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one another's heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round in pairs, until many of them dropped.
<p/>While those were down, the rest linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke, and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then reversed the spin, and all spun round another way.
<p/>Suddenly they stopped again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high up, swooped screaming off.
<p/>It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the heart.
<p/>Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become.
<p/>The maidenly bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted, the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of the disjointed time.
<p/>As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer's house, the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.
<p/>O my father!'' for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) lifted up the eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had momentarily darkened with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hand; <div class="bookquote">``such a cruel, bad sight.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do so, implicitly. I must see Lorry. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. They both knew too well what it meant.
<p/>One. Two. Three. Three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow. '' I must see Lorry,'' the Doctor repeated, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) another way.
<p/>The staunch old gentleman was still in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) trust; had never left it. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and made national.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could save for the owners, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) saved. No better man living to hold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping, and to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) peace.
<p/>A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted the approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at the Bank.
<p/>The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters: National Property.
<p/>Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death! Who could that be with Mr. Lorry--the owner of the riding-coat upon the chair--who must not be seen?
<p/>To whom did he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) appear to repeat her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) faltering words, when, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) voice and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head towards the door of the room from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had issued, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?
<p/>From whom newly arrived, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) come out, agitated and surprised, to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) favourite in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arms? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>VI. Triumph
<p/>The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners.
<p/>The standard gaoler-joke was, <div class="bookquote">``Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you inside there!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!''  (<font color='red'><b>La Force</b></font>)</div>So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.
<p/>When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them to assure himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) place, and went through the list, making a similar short pause at each name.
<p/>There were twenty-three names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been guillotined and forgotten.
<p/>The list was read, in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) arrival.
<p/>Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human creature he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had since cared for and parted with, had died on the scaffold.
<p/>Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had seen hundreds pass away so. There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was soon over.
<p/>It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert, for that evening.
<p/>They crowded to the grates and shed tears there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night.
<p/>Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind.
<p/>In seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it.
<p/>The prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the time. And all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke them.
<p/>The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before Charles Darnay's name was called.
<p/>All the fifteen were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half. '' Charles Evremonde, called Darnay,'' was at length arraigned.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Evremonde</b></font>) judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing.
<p/>Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Evremonde</b></font>) might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the honest men.
<p/>The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving, anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check.
<p/>Of the men, the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many knitted.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) was in a front row, by the side of a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never seen since his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrival at the Barrier, but whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) directly remembered as Defarge.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) once or twice whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ear, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) seemed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife; but, what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most noticed in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be, they never looked towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>They seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at the Jury, but at nothing else.
<p/>Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) arm as she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) worked. Under the President sat Doctor Manette, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) usual quiet dress.
<p/>As well as the prisoner could see, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) and Mr. Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the Carmagnole.
<p/>Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death.
<p/>It was nothing that the decree bore date since his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) return to France. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was, and there was the decree; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had been taken in France, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) head was demanded.
<p/>The President rang his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) bell to silence those cries, and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had lived many years in England?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take off his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) head!''  (<font color='red'><b>the audience</b></font>)</div>cried the audience. '' An enemy to the Republic! '' Undoubtedly it was. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) not an emigrant then?
<p/>What did he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) call himself? Not an emigrant, he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law. Why not? the President desired to know.
<p/>Because he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>), and a station that was distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>), and had left his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) country--he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) own industry in England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.
<p/>What proof had he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) of this? He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and Alexandre Manette. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) had married in England?
<p/>the President reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>). True, but not an English woman. A citizeness of France? Yes. By birth. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name and family?
<p/>'' Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who sits there. '' This answer had a happy effect upon the audience.
<p/>So capriciously were the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as if with impatience to pluck him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) out into the streets and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall. On these few steps of his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) foot according to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions.
<p/>The same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>), and had prepared every inch of his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) road. The President asked, why had he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) returned to France when he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) did, and not sooner?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had not returned sooner, he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) replied, simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had no means of living in France, save those he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had resigned; whereas, in England, he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had returned when he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) did, on the pressing and written entreaty of a French citizen, who represented that his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) life was endangered by his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) absence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had come back, to save a citizen's life, and to bear his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth.
<p/>Was that criminal in the eyes of the Republic? The populace cried enthusiastically, <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>The populace</b></font>)</div>and the President rang his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) bell to quiet them.
<p/>Which it did not, for they continued to cry <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>until they left off, of their own will. The President required the name of that citizen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) also referred with confidence to the citizen's letter, which had been taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) at the Barrier, but which he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the President.
<p/>The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) that it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read.
<p/>Citizen Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) had been slightly overlooked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out of the Tribunal's patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury's declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) was answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde, called Darnay.
<p/>The accused explained that the citizen was his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) first witness. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Doctor Manette was next questioned.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) high personal popularity, and the clearness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) answers, made a great impression; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) proceeded, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) showed that the Accused was his (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) first friend on his (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) release from his (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England, always faithful and devoted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) daughter and himself in their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) had actually been tried for his (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) life by it, as the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) brought these circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the populace became one.
<p/>At last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Accused</b></font>) appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the President were content to receive them.
<p/>At every vote -LRB-the Jurymen voted aloud and individually-RRB-, the populace set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner's favour, and the President declared him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) free.
<p/>Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against their swollen account of cruel rage.
<p/>No man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable, to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating.
<p/>No sooner was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), that after his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) long and unwholesome confinement he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was in danger of fainting from exhaustion; none the less because he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knew very well, that the very same people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) with the very same intensity, to rend him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) to pieces and strew him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) over the streets.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried, rescued him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) from these caresses for the moment.
<p/>Five were to be tried together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed.
<p/>So quick was the Tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four hours.
<p/>The first of them told him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) so, with the customary prison sign of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, <div class="bookquote">``Long live the Republic!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings, for when he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) had seen in Court--except two, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) looked in vain.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) coming out, the concourse made at him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the shore.
<p/>They put him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) into a great chair they had among them, and which they had taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages.
<p/>Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top.
<p/>In this car of triumph, not even the Doctor's entreaties could prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) being carried to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) home on men's shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) more than once misdoubted his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mind being in confusion, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was in the tumbril on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) way to the Guillotine.
<p/>Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) thus into the courtyard of the building where he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) lived.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) father had gone on before, to prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), and when her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) husband stood upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feet, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) dropped insensible in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arms.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) beautiful head between his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face and the brawling crowd, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tears and her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lips might come together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing.
<p/>In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) out, they carried him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on. Instantly, all the rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.
<p/>Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river's bank, and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away.
<p/>After grasping the Doctor's hand, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stood victorious and proud before him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>); after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in breathless from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole; after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) wife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arms, and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) up to their rooms.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucie! My own! I am safe. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``And now speak to your father, dearest.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father's breast, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) poor head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) own breast, long, long ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was happy in the return he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was recompensed for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suffering, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) strength.
<p/>No other man in all this France could have done what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has done for me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' You must not be weak, my darling,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) remonstrated; <div class="bookquote">``don't tremble so.
<p/>I have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>VII. A Knock at the Door <div class="bookquote">``I have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Knock</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>A Knock</b></font>)</div>It was not another of the dreams in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Knock</b></font>) had often come back; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knock</b></font>) was really here.
<p/>All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her (<font color='blue'><b>Knock</b></font>) husband and as dear to others as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Knock</b></font>), every day shared the fate from which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been clutched, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Knock</b></font>) heart could not be as lightened of its load as she (<font color='blue'><b>Knock</b></font>) felt it ought to be.
<p/>The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Knock</b></font>) mind pursued them, looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) among the Condemned; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Knock</b></font>) clung closer to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) real presence and trembled more.
<p/>And yet his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife trembled, and a vague but heavy fear was upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father, cheering her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), showed a compassionate superiority to this woman's weakness, which was wonderful to see.
<p/>No garret, no shoemaking, no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had accomplished the task he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had set himself
<p/>Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) imprisonment, had had to pay heavily for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bad food, and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) guard, and towards the living of the poorer prisoners.
<p/>Partly on this account, and partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them occasional service; and Jerry -LRB-almost wholly transferred to them by Mr. Lorry-RRB- had become their daily retainer, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) bed there every night.
<p/>It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground.
<p/>Mr. Jerry Cruncher's name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called Darnay.
<p/>, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) promise was redeemed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had saved Charles. Let them all lean upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual harmless ways of life were changed.
<p/>In the Doctor's little household, as in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small shops.
<p/>To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy, was the general desire. For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors;
<p/>Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home such purchases as were needful.
<p/>Although Miss Pross, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) long association with a French family, might have known as much of their language as of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had had a mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had no mind in that direction; consequently she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) knew no more of that <div class="bookquote">``nonsense''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was pleased to call it-RRB- than Mr. Cruncher did.
<p/>So her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) manner of marketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be the name of the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) always made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price, one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) number might be.
<p/>the former carrying the money; the latter, the basket. '' Now, Mr. Cruncher,'' said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity; <div class="bookquote">``if you are ready, I am.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) had worn all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) rust off long ago, but nothing would file his (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) spiky head down.
<p/>'' There's all manner of things wanted,'' said Miss Pross, ``and we shall have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>retorted Jerry, <div class="bookquote">``whether they drink your health or the Old Un's.
<p/>Nice toasts these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>'' '' Who's he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>)?'' said Miss Pross. Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Old Nick's.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``it doesn't need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it's Midnight Murder, and Mischief.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>``but I may say among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the streets.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>cried Lucie. '' Yes, yes, yes, I'll be cautious,'' said Miss Pross; Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!
<p/>Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don't move your pretty head from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!
<p/>May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?'' <div class="bookquote">``I think you may take that liberty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor answered, smiling.
<p/>'' For gracious sake, don't talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of that,'' said Miss Pross. '' Hush, dear! Again?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``the short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third;''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; <div class="bookquote">``and as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>Lucie remonstrated. '' Well, my sweet,'' said Miss Pross, nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head emphatically, On him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) our hopes we fix, God save the King!''
<p/>I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice,'' said Miss Pross, approvingly.
<p/>Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words after Miss Pross, like somebody at church. '' '' But the question, Doctor Manette.
<p/>Is there''--it was the good creature's way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all, and to come at it in this chance
<p/>manner--<div class="bookquote">``is there any prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?''  (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div>``I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heigh-ho-hum!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) darling's golden hair in the light of the fire, <div class="bookquote">``then we must have patience and wait: that's all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>We must hold up our heads and fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Don't you move, Ladybird!''
<p/>They went out, leaving Lucie, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father, and the child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the Banking House.
<p/>Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed.
<p/>Little Lucie sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) grandfather with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) hands clasped through his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) arm: and he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>), in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) a story of a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out a captive who had once done the Fairy a service.
<p/>All was subdued and quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had been. '' What is that? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) cried, all at once.
<p/>'' My dear!'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father, stopping in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) story, and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand on hers, ``command yourself. What a disordered state you are in!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought, my father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face and in a faltering voice, <div class="bookquote">``that I heard strange feet upon the stairs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div><p/>The least thing--nothing--startles you! You , your father's daughter!'' '' My love, the staircase is as still as Death. '' As he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.
<p/>'' Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)!'' '' My child,'' said the Doctor, rising, and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``I have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).
<p/>What weakness is this, my dear! Let me go to the door. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) took the lamp in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms, and opened it.
<p/>A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.
<p/>'' The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay,'' said the first. '' Who seeks him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>)?'' answered Darnay. '' I seek him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). We seek him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).
<p/>I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the Tribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner of the Republic. '' The four surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), where he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wife and child clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will know to-morrow.
<p/>Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stood with the lamp in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) were a statue made to hold it, moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting the speaker, and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), not ungently, by the loose front of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) red woollen shirt, said: <div class="bookquote">``You know him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), you have said.
<p/>You are summoned for to-morrow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Do you know me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.''  (<font color='red'><b>Citizen</b></font>)</div>'' We all know you, Citizen Doctor,'' said the other three.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice, after a pause: <div class="bookquote">``Will you answer his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) question to me then?
<p/>How does this happen?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Citizen Doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the first, reluctantly, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) has been denounced to the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pointing out the second who had entered, <div class="bookquote">``is from Saint Antoine.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The citizen</b></font>)</div>The citizen here indicated nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) head, and added: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) is accused by Saint Antoine.''  (<font color='red'><b>The citizen</b></font>)</div>'' Of what?'' asked the Doctor.
<p/>'' Citizen Doctor,'' said the first, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) former reluctance, <div class="bookquote">``ask no more. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them.
<p/>The Republic goes before all. The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Citizen Doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``One word,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor entreated. '' Will you tell me who denounced him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is against rule,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the first; <div class="bookquote">``but you can ask Him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) of Saint Antoine here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div>The Doctor turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes upon that man.
<p/>Who moved uneasily on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) feet, rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) beard a little, and at length said: <div class="bookquote">``Well! Truly it is against rule.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is denounced--and gravely--by the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What other?'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you ask, Citizen Doctor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Then,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, <div class="bookquote">``you will be answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!''  (<font color='red'><b>Antoine/Saint Antoine</b></font>)</div>VIII.
<p/>A Hand at Cards Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) mind the number of indispensable purchases she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had to make.
<p/>They both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers.
<p/>It was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the Republic.
<p/>Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) side. Woe to the man who played tricks with that Army, or got undeserved promotion in it!
<p/>Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.
<p/>After peeping into several wine-shops, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) stopped at the sign of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace, once -LRB-and twice-RRB-
<p/>Better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) beard had never grown, for the National Razor shaved him (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) close. the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather took her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) fancy.
<p/>It had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was not so red as the rest.
<p/>Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) cavalier.
<p/>Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth, playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted, bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of the others listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>); of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude, like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached the counter, and showed what they wanted.
<p/>As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a corner, and rose to depart. In going, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to face Miss Pross.
<p/>No sooner did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) hands. In a moment, the whole company were on their feet.
<p/>Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman, evidently English.
<p/>What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss Pross and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) protector, though they had been all ears.
<p/>That somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence. But, they had no ears for anything in their surprise.
<p/>For, it must be recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but, Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) own separate and individual account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.
<p/>What is the matter?'' said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice -LRB-though in a low tone-RRB-, and in English.
<p/>'' '' Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon! '' cried Miss Pross, clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) hands again. '' After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time, do I find you here!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the man, in a furtive, frightened way.
<p/>'' Brother, brother!'' cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. '' Have I ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then hold your meddlesome tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon</b></font>)</div>said Solomon, ``and come out, if you want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out.
<p/>Miss Pross, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) loving and dejected head at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) by no means affectionate brother, said through her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) tears, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cruncher.''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>Who's this man?'' <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come out too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon</b></font>)</div>said Solomon. '' Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) think me a ghost? '' Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) looks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) said not a word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) reticule through her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) tears with great difficulty paid for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) wine.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) did so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits.
<p/>'' Now,'' said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, <div class="bookquote">``what do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``to give me such a greeting, and show me no affection. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>'' There. Confound it! There,'' said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross's lips with his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) own.
<p/>If you expect me to be surprised,'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) brother Solomon, <div class="bookquote">``I am not surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here.
<p/>If you really don't want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>brother Solomon</b></font>)</div>Now are you content?'' Miss Pross only shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head and wept in silence. '' I am busy. I am an official.''
<p/>My English brother Solomon,'' mourned Miss Pross, casting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) tear-fraught eyes, <div class="bookquote">``that had the makings in him (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) of one of the best and greatest of men in his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) native country, an official among foreigners, and such foreigners!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)-- '' <div class="bookquote">``I said so! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) brother, interrupting.
<p/>'' I knew it. You want to be the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister.
<p/>Just as I am getting on!'' '' The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid! '' cried Miss Pross. '' Far rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever loved you truly, and ever shall.
<p/>Say but one affectionate word to me, and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will detain you no longer.
<p/>As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) money and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed -LRB-which is invariably the case, all the world over-RRB-, when Mr. Cruncher, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) on the shoulder, hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question: <div class="bookquote">``I say!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers. Might I ask the favour?
<p/>As to whether your name is John Solomon, or Solomon John? '' The official turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) with sudden distrust. He (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) had not previously uttered a word.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher. '' Speak out, you know. '' -LRB-Which, by the way, was more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) could do himself.-RRB-
<p/>'' John Solomon, or Solomon John? She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) calls you Solomon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) must know, being your sister. And I know you're John, you know.
<p/>Which of the two goes first? And regarding that name of Pross, likewise. That warn't your name over the water. ''
<p/>'' What do you mean?'' '' Well, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your name was, over the water.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No. But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables.'' <div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. T'other one's was one syllable.
<p/>I know you. You was a spy--witness at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to yourself, was you called at that time?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Barsad,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another voice, striking in. '' That's the name for a thousand pound!'' cried Jerry. The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) under the skirts of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) riding-coat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) stood at Mr. Cruncher's elbow as negligently as he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.
<p/>I arrived at Mr. Lorry's, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother.
<p/>'' Don't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons.
<p/>'' Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) dared-- <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sydney.
<p/>I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls, an hour or more ago.
<p/>Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your direction.
<p/>'' You have a face to be remembered, and I remember faces well. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near you.
<p/>I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature of your calling.
<p/>And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad. '' <div class="bookquote">``What purpose? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>the spy asked.
<p/>'' It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your company--at the office of Tellson's Bank, for instance?''
<p/>'' Under a threat?'' '' Oh! Did I say that?'' '' Then, why should I go there?'' <div class="bookquote">``Really, Mr. Barsad, I can't say, if you can't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that you won't say, sir? ''  (<font color='red'><b>sir the spy</b></font>)</div>the spy irresolutely asked. '' You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad.
<p/>Carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) quickness and skill, in such a business as he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) secret mind, and with such a man as he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) had to do with.
<p/>Now, I told you so,'' said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) sister; <div class="bookquote">``if any trouble comes of this, it's your doing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>I won't. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) practised eye saw it, and made the most of it. '' <div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Mr. Barsad!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sydney.
<p/>But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction.
<p/>'' Don't be ungrateful. Do you go with me to the Bank?'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I'll go with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross.
<p/>This is not a good city, at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) to Mr. Lorry's with us.
<p/>Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) life remembered, that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) hands on Sydney's arm and looked up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face, imploring him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only contradicted his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) light manner, but changed and raised the man.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) affection, and with Sydney's friendly reassurances, adequately to heed what she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) observed.
<p/>They left her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr. Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk.
<p/>Mr. Lorry had just finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) dinner, and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago.
<p/>Are we ready? Come then!''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Barsad/Barsad</b></font>)</div>John Barsad, or Solomon Pross, walked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) saw a stranger.
<p/>'' Miss Pross's brother, sir,'' said Sydney. '' Mr. Barsad.'' <div class="bookquote">``Barsad? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman Barsad</b></font>)</div>repeated the old gentleman, ``Barsad? I have an association with the name--and with the face.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) took a chair himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted, by saying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) with a frown, <div class="bookquote">``Witness at that trial.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observed Carton, coolly. '' Pray sit down. '' '' Mr. Lorry immediately remembered, and regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence.
<p/>Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of,'' said Sydney, <div class="bookquote">``and has acknowledged the relationship.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div>I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again. '' Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``What do you tell me!
<p/>I left him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) safe and free within these two hours, and am about to return to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Arrested for all that.
<p/>Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Sydney, <div class="bookquote">``and I have it from Mr. Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place.
<p/>When was it done, Mr. Barsad?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just now, if at all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) left the messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter.
<p/>There is no earthly doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) is retaken. '' Mr. Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point.
<p/>Now, I trust,'' said Sydney to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that the name and influence of Doctor Manette may stand him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) in as good stead to-morrow--you said he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--
<p/>Confused, but sensible that something might depend on his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) presence of mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) commanded himself, and was silently attentive. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/>Yes; I believe so.'' ''--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own to you,
<p/>I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette's not having had the power to prevent this arrest. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) may not have known of it beforehand,'' said Mr. Lorry.
<p/>'' But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how identified he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) son-in-law.'' '' That's true,'' Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) troubled hand at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) chin, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) troubled eyes on Carton.
<p/>'' In short,'' said Sydney, <div class="bookquote">``this is a desperate time, when desperate games are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I will play the losing one.
<p/>No man's life here is worth purchase. Any one carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend in the Conciergerie.
<p/>And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr. Barsad. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You need have good cards, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy.
<p/>'' I'll run them over. I'll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy.
<p/>'' It was put before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) drank off a glassful--drank off another glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away. '' Mr. Barsad,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) employers under a false name.
<p/>Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the enemy of France and freedom.
<p/>Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find.
<p/>That's a very good card. That's an excellent card. That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr. Barsad?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not to understand your play,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>returned the spy, somewhat uneasily. '' I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section Committee.
<p/>Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don't hurry. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and drank it off.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) saw that the spy was fearful of his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>).
<p/>Seeing it, he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) poured out and drank another glassful. '' Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time. '' It was a poorer hand than he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) suspected.
<p/>Thrown out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) honourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there--not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) was not wanted there; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date--he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) own countrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) knew that under the overthrown government he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) had been a spy upon Saint Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop; had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment, release, and history, as should serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) for an introduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame Defarge, and had broken down with them signally.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) always remembered with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) talked with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and had looked ominously at him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fingers moved.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had since seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over again produce her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) knew, as every one employed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) was did, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) was never safe; that flight was impossible; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror, a word might bring it down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>).
<p/>Once denounced, and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) had seen many proofs, would produce against him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) that fatal register, and would quash his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) last chance of life.
<p/>Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) turned them over.
<p/>Mr. Barsad saw losing cards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. '' You scarcely seem to like your hand,'' said Sydney, with the greatest composure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) turned to Mr. Lorry, <div class="bookquote">``I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) can under any circumstances reconcile it to his (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) station to play that Ace of which he (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) has spoken.
<p/>I admit that I am a spy, and that it is considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) so demean himself as to make himself one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Carton, taking the answer on himself, and looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) watch, ``without any scruple, in a very few minutes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have hoped, gentlemen both,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy that</b></font>)</div>said the spy, always striving to hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, <div class="bookquote">``that your respect for my sister--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>said Sydney Carton.
<p/>The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) usual demeanour, received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>),--that it faltered here and failed him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>).
<p/>'' Do you play?'' '' '' You think not, sir?'' <div class="bookquote">``I have thoroughly made up my mind about it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>While he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) former air of contemplating cards:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I have another good card here, not yet enumerated.
<p/>That friend and fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons; who was he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``French. You don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy, quickly.
<p/>'' French, eh?'' repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) at all, though he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) echoed his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) word. '' Well; he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) may be.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is, I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy; <div class="bookquote">``though it's not important. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>'' Though it's not important,'' repeated Carton, in the same mechanical way--<div class="bookquote">``though
<p/>it's not important-- No, it's not important. No. Yet I know the face.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think not. I am sure not. It can't be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy.
<p/>'' It-can`t-be,'' muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) glass -LRB-which fortunately was a small one-RRB- again. '' Can't-be. Spoke good French.
<p/>Yet like a foreigner, I thought?'' <div class="bookquote">``Provincial,''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>said the spy. '' No. Foreign! '' cried Carton, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) open hand on the table, as a light broke clearly on his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) mind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, there you are hasty, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barsad/Barsad</b></font>)</div>said Barsad, with a smile that gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; <div class="bookquote">``there you really give me an advantage over you.
<p/>Cly -LRB-who I will unreservedly admit, at this distance of time, was a partner of mine-RRB- has been dead several years.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barsad/Barsad</b></font>)</div>Cly! Disguised, but the same man. We had that man before us at the Old Bailey.'' I attended him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) last illness.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) remains, but I helped to lay him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) coffin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) was buried in London, at the church of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. '' Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sat, of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall.
<p/>Tracing it to its source, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher's head.
<p/>To show you how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will lay before you a certificate of Cly's burial, which I happened to have carried in my pocket-book,'' with a hurried hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) produced and opened it, <div class="bookquote">``ever since.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Let us be reasonable,'' said the spy, <div class="bookquote">``and let us be fair. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it!
<p/>You may take it in your hand; it's no forgery. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) hair could not have been more violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.
<p/>Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) side, and touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff. ''
<p/>That there Roger Cly, master,'' said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and iron-bound visage. '' So you put him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) coffin?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who took him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) out of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barsad/Barsad</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I mean,'' said Mr. Cruncher, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) warn't never in it. No!

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at Jerry. '' I tell you,'' said Jerry, <div class="bookquote">``that you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin.
<p/>Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a take in. Me and two more knows it. ''

<p/>Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and explain himself.

<p/>Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has the mystery about him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) of having feigned death and come to life again!
<p/>'' I hold another card, Mr. Barsad. A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. A strong card--a certain Guillotine card!
<p/>I confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cly</b></font>) never would have got away at all
<p/>Do you play?'' <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div>returned the spy. '' I throw up. but for that sham. Though how this man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you trouble your head about this man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>retorted the contentious Mr. Cruncher; ``you'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman.
<p/>Cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) liberality--``I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.
<p/>The Sheep of the prisons turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) to Sydney Carton, and said, with more decision, <div class="bookquote">``It has come to a point.
<p/>And look here! Once more!'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--Mr. '' I go on duty soon, and can't overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it?
<p/>Ask me to do anything in my office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent.
<p/>Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. In short, I should make that choice. You talk of desperation.

<p/>The Game Made While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust.
<p/>That honest tradesman's manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) changed the leg on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) rested, as often as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had fifty of those limbs, and were trying them all; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.
<p/>Come into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>IX. '' Jerry,'' said Mr. Lorry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here.

'' What have you been, besides a messenger?''
<p/>After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) patron, Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, <div class="bookquote">``Agicultooral character.''

<p/>And here's Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given, a floppin' again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark ruinating!
<p/>Well, that `ud be imposing, too, on Tellson's. For you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander. Whereas them medical doctors' wives don't flop--catch 'em at it!

<p/>You are free from that misfortune, however. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand, and Carton gently pressed it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) the means of anticipating the sentence.

<p/>Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) looked quickly at Carton to see if it were in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind.
<p/>It seemed to be; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) returned the look, and evidently understood it. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) might think a thousand things,'' Carton said, <div class="bookquote">``and any of them would only add to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) trouble.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob. It attracted Mr. Lorry's eyes to Carton's face, which was turned to the fire.
<p/>A light, or a shade -LRB-the old gentleman could not have said which-RRB-, passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a wild bright day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) foot to put back one of the little flaming logs, which was tumbling forward.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wore the white riding-coat and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) look very pale, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) long brown hair, all untrimmed, hanging loose about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry; his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had broken under the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) foot.
<p/>Taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was strongly reminded of that expression.
<p/>'' I forgot it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said. Mr. Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face. '' And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?'' said Carton, turning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>).
<p/>As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here.
<p/>'' Yes. I hoped to have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have my Leave to Pass.
<p/>I was ready to go. '' They were both silent. '' Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?'' said Carton, wistfully.
<p/>'' I am in my seventy-eighth year. '' <div class="bookquote">``You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied; trusted, respected, and looked up to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I may say that I was a man of business when a boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss you when you leave it empty!''  (<font color='red'><b>A bachelor</b></font>)</div>'' A solitary old bachelor,'' answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' There is nobody to weep for me. '' <div class="bookquote">``How can you say that? Wouldn't She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) weep for you? Wouldn't her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) child?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, thank God. I didn't quite mean what I said. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is a thing to thank God for; is it not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night, 'I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!'

<p/>Sydney turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a few moments, said: <div class="bookquote">``I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Do the days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' said Carton. '' I am not old, but my young way was never the way to age. Enough of me.
<p/>'' '' And of me, I am sure,'' said Mr. Lorry. '' Are you going out?'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll walk with you to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gate.
<p/>You know my vagabond and restless habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don't be uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning.

<p/>Carton left him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate again when it was shut, and touched it.
<p/>A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) going to the prison every day. ''

'' Good night, citizen,'' said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the man eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inquisitively.
<p/>'' Good night, citizen. '' <div class="bookquote">``How goes the Republic?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount to a hundred soon.

<p/>As the grinning little man held out the pipe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was smoking, to explain how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) turned away.
<p/>Less than two pipes. Word of honour! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But you are not English,'' said the wood-sawyer, <div class="bookquote">``though you wear English dress?''

<p/>Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pencil on a scrap of paper.
<p/>well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual, for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of terror--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped at a chemist's shop, which the owner was closing with his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) own hands.
<p/>'' And take a pipe with you!'' Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered the way A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.
<p/>Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) confronted him (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) counter, he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) laid the scrap of paper before him (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>).

<p/>Long ago, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) had been famous among his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) earliest competitors as a youth of great promise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) had followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) father to the grave.

<p/>In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow rising in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death, and for to-morrow's victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons, and still of to-morrow's and to-morrow's, the chain of association that brought the words home, like a rusty old ship's anchor from the deep, might have been easily found.

<p/>that length of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for the lighter streets.
<p/>Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy shoes, and trudged.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>coaches</b></font>) did not seek it, but repeated them and went on. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the people poured cheerfully out as he (<font color='blue'><b>coaches</b></font>) passed, and went chatting home.
<p/>At one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking for a way across the street through the mud.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>coaches</b></font>) carried the child over, and before the timid arm was loosed from his (<font color='blue'><b>coaches</b></font>) neck asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for a kiss. ''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>coaches</b></font>) that believeth in me, though he (<font color='blue'><b>coaches</b></font>) were dead, yet shall he (<font color='blue'><b>coaches</b></font>) live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.
<p/>Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words were in the echoes of his (<font color='blue'><b>coaches</b></font>) feet, and were in the air.
<p/>I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: '' Perfectly calm and steady, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sometimes repeated them to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) walked; but, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) heard them always.
<p/>The night wore out, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the sky.
<p/>Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died, and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to Death's dominion.
<p/>But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden of the night, straight and warm to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) heart in its long bright rays.
<p/>And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light appeared to span the air between him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and the sun, while the river sparkled under it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) walked by the stream, far from the houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) awoke and was afoot again, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lingered there yet a little longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--<div class="bookquote">``Like me.
<p/>A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then glided into his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) view, floated by him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and died away.
<p/>As its silent track in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) heart for a merciful consideration of all his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) poor blindnesses and errors, ended in the words,
<p/>The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial friend, in the morning stillness. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am the resurrection and the life.
<p/>Mr. Lorry was already out when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) got back, and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone.
<p/>Sydney Carton drank nothing but a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh himself, went out to the place of trial.
<p/>The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell away from in dread--pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into an obscure corner among the crowd.
<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) husband was brought in, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) turned a look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), so sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness, yet so courageous for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sake, that it called the healthy blood into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face, brightened his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) glance, and animated his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart.

Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure, ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing.
<p/>There could have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.
<p/>Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day after.
<p/>Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers perpetually hovering about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators.
<p/>A life-thirsting, cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St. Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.
<p/>Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor. No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising, murderous business-meaning there.
<p/>Every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one another, before bending forward with a strained attention.
<p/>Suspected and Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants, one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people.

<p/>To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor. The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?

<p/>The craving man on the jury rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands together, and restored the usual hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth. This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.

<p/>In a hole in the chimney, where a stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is that written paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767.
<p/>I design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it.
<p/>X. The Substance of the Shadow I write it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I and my sorrows are dust.
<p/>These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity.
<p/>I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right mind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.
<p/>One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December -LRB-I think the twenty-second of the month-RRB- in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air, at an hour's distance from my place of residence in the Street of the School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very fast.
<p/>As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a voice called to the driver to stop.
<p/>The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) horses, and the same voice called to me by my name.
<p/>The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hope has quite departed from my breast. '' '' I answered. '' I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves.
<p/>As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and -LRB-as far as I could see-RRB- face too.
<p/>'' ''`Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; `the young physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris?'
<p/>'' `You are Doctor Manette?' said one. '' I am. ''`Gentlemen,' I returned, 'I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so graciously.'
<p/>''`We have been to your residence,' said the first, `and not being so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of overtaking you.
<p/>The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door.
<p/>Gentlemen,' said I, `pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned.'
<p/>Will you please to enter the carriage?' '' They were armed. I was not. '' ' '' The reply to this was made by him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) who had spoken second. '
<p/>As to the nature of the case, our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it.
<p/>Doctor, your clients are people of condition. Enough. Will you please to enter the carriage?' '' I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence.
<p/>They both entered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps. The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.
<p/>'' I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt that it is, word for word, the same.
<p/>Where I make the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my paper in its hiding-place.
<p/>I describe everything exactly as it took place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. * **** '' The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and emerged upon the country road.
<p/>At two-thirds of a league from the Barrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed, to the door of the house.
<p/>It was not opened immediately, in answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck the man who opened it, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heavy riding glove, across the face.
<p/>There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention, for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs.
<p/>But, the other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.
<p/>From the time of our alighting at the outer gate -LRB-which we found locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had relocked-RRB-, I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber.
<p/>I was conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain, lying on a bed.
<p/>'' '' '' The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much past twenty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair was torn and ragged, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms were bound to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sides with sashes and handkerchiefs.
<p/>On one of them, which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble, and the letter E.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient; for, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) restless strivings she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had turned over on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face on the edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth, and was in danger of suffocation.
<p/>My first act was to put out my hand to relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the corner caught my sight.
<p/>I turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gently over, placed my hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breast to calm her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) down, and looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes were dilated and wild, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the words, `My husband, my father, and my brother!' and then counted up to twelve, and said, `Hush!'
<p/>For an instant, and no more, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would pause to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would repeat the cry, `My husband, my father, and my brother!' and would count up to twelve, and say, `Hush!'
<p/>I noticed that these bonds were all portions of a gentleman's dress. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>There was no variation in the order, or the manner.
<p/>`How long,' I asked, `has this lasted?' <div class="bookquote">``To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the younger; by the elder, I mean him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) who exercised the most authority.
<p/>There was no cessation, but the regular moment's pause, in the utterance of these sounds. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was the elder who replied, `Since about this hour last night.'
<p/>''`She (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has a husband, a father, and a brother?' '''A brother.' '' 'I do not address her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brother?' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) answered with great contempt, `No.'
<p/>''`She (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has some recent association with the number twelve?' '' The younger brother impatiently rejoined, `With twelve o'clock?' ''`See, gentlemen,' said I, still keeping my hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) breast, `how useless I am, as you have brought me!
<p/>If I had known what I was coming to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost.
<p/>The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, `There is a case of medicines here;' and brought it from a closet, and put it on the table.
<p/>There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.' '' * **** '' I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my lips.
<p/>If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.
<p/>'' `Do you doubt them?' asked the younger brother. '' `You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,' I replied, and said no more.
<p/>As I intended to repeat it after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then sat down by the side of the bed.
<p/>'' I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many efforts, the dose that I desired to give. There was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance -LRB-wife of the man down-stairs-RRB-, who had retreated into a corner.
<p/>The house was damp and decayed, indifferently furnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the sound of the shrieks.
<p/>They continued to be uttered in their regular succession, with the cry, ' My husband, my father, and my brother!' the counting up to twelve, and `Hush!'
<p/>The frenzy was so violent, that I had not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to them, to see that they were not painful.
<p/>The only spark of encouragement in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer's breast had this much soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure.
<p/>For the reason that my hand had this effect -LRB-I assume-RRB-, I had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on, before the elder said: ''`There is another patient.'
<p/>It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more regular. '' '' I was startled, and asked, `Is it a pressing case?'
<p/>The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which was a species of loft over a stable.
<p/>There was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and there were beams across.
<p/>Hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand.
<p/>''`You had better see,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) carelessly answered; and took up a light. * **** '' I had to pass through that part, to get at the other.
<p/>I try it with these details, and I see them all, in this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my captivity, as I saw them all that night.
<p/>On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) head, lay a handsome peasant boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) back, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) teeth set, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) right hand clenched on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) breast, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) glaring eyes looking straight upward.
<p/>My memory is circumstantial and unshaken. '' I could not see where his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>);
<p/>but, I could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) was dying of a wound from a sharp point. '' 'I am a doctor, my poor fellow,' said I. `Let me examine it.'
<p/>'' 'I do not want it examined,' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) answered; `let it be.' '' It was under his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand, and I soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to let me move his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand away.
<p/>The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours before, but no skill could have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) if it had been looked to without delay.
<p/>As I turned my eyes to the elder brother, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all as if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) were a fellow-creature.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was then dying fast. '' `How has this been done, monsieur?' said I. '''A crazed young common dog! A serf!
<p/>Forced my brother to draw upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and has fallen by my brother's sword--like a gentleman.' '' There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this answer.
<p/>The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would have been better if he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had died in the usual obscure routine of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) vermin kind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the boy, or about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fate. '' The boy's eyes had slowly moved to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had spoken, and they now slowly moved to me.
<p/>''`Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but we have a little pride left, sometimes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)--have you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), Doctor?' '' The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the distance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) referred to them, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) were lying in our presence.
<p/>They have had their shameful rights, these Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we have had good girls among us.
<p/>'' I said, 'I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).' ''`She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is my sister, Doctor. I know it, and have heard my father say so.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was a good girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was betrothed to a good young man, too: a tenant of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). We were all tenants of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--that man's who stands there.
<p/>It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak; but, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.
<p/>''`We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs are by those superior Beings--taxed by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without mercy, obliged to work for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mill, obliged to feed scores of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) people should not see it and take it from us
<p/>--I say, we were so robbed, and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable race die out!'
<p/>The other is his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brother, the worst of a bad race.' '' '' I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth like a fire.
<p/>I had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the dying boy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was ailing at that time, poor fellow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) married her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) lover, that she (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) might tend and comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in our cottage--our dog-hut, as that man would call it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) had not been married many weeks, when that man's brother saw her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) and admired her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>), and asked that man to lend her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--for what are husbands among us!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and hated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother with a hatred as strong as mine.
<p/>''`Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. What did the two then, to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband to use his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) influence with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), to make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) willing?'
<p/>The boy's eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said was true.
<p/>The two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this Bastille; the gentleman's, all negligent indifference; the peasant's, all trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.
<p/>`You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us.
<p/>You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed.
<p/>'' '' They so harnessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) and drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>). They kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) out in the unwholesome mists at night, and ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) harness in the day.
<p/>Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) could find food--he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the bell, and died on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bosom.'
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobles</b></font>) was not persuaded. No! '' Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) determination to tell all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wrong.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forced back the gathering shadows of death, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forced his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wound.
<p/>''`Then, with that man's permission and even with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) aid, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) brother took her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) away; in spite of what I know she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must have told his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) brother--and what that is, will not be long unknown to you,
<p/>Doctor, if it is now--his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) brother took her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) away--for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) pleasure and diversion, for a little while. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pass me on the road.
<p/>I took my young sister -LRB-for I have another-RRB- to a place beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will never be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vassal.
<p/>Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed in--a common dog, but sword in hand.--Where is the loft window?
<p/>When I took the tidings home, our father's heart burst; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never spoke one of the words that filled it. It was somewhere here?'
<p/>I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.
<p/>'' The room was darkening to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sight; the world was narrowing around him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). '' `She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) heard me, and ran in.
<p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) not to come near us till he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck at me with a whip.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) break into as many pieces as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will, the sword that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stained with my common blood; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) drew to defend himself--thrust at me with all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) skill for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life.'
<p/>But I, though a common dog, so struck at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as to make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) draw. '' My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of a broken sword, lying among the hay.
<p/>That weapon was a gentleman's. In another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier's. ''`Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up.
<p/>Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)?' '' ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is not here,' I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) referred to the brother.
<p/>''' He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)! Proud as these nobles are, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is afraid to see me. Where is the man who was here? Turn my face to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).'
<p/>But, invested for the moment with extraordinary power, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) raised himself completely: obliging me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>''`Marquis,' said the boy, turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) eyes opened wide, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) right hand raised, `in the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to answer for them.
<p/>'' I did so, raising the boy's head against my knee. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that I do it.
<p/>In the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them separately.
<p/>Twice, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand to the wound in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) breast, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) forefinger drew a cross in the air.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stood for an instant with the finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dropped with it, and I laid him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) down dead.
<p/>When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raving in precisely the same order of continuity.
<p/>I knew that this might last for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave.
<p/>I repeated the medicines I had given her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and I sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced.
<p/>I mark this cross of blood upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), as a sign that I do it.' '' * **** '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never abated the piercing quality of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) words.
<p/>They were always `My husband, my father, and my brother! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
<p/>Hush!' '' This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I had come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to falter.
<p/>I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and by-and-bye she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.
<p/>I released her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms, and called the woman to assist me to compose her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) figure and the dress she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had torn.
<p/>It was then that I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had had of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>''`Is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dead?' asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the elder brother, coming booted into the room from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) horse. ''`Not dead,' said I; `but like to die.'
<p/>'' It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and fearful storm. ''`What strength there is in these common bodies!'
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with some curiosity. ''' There is prodigious strength,' I answered him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), `in sorrow and despair.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) moved a chair with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a subdued voice, ''`Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I recommended that your aid should be invited.
<p/>Your reputation is high, and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful of your interest.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. The things that you see here, are things to be seen, and not spoken of.'
<p/>'' I listened to the patient's breathing, and avoided answering. '' `Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?' ''`Monsieur,' said I, `in my profession, the communications of patients are always received in confidence.'
<p/>I was guarded in my answer, for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen. ''
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more.
<p/>Looking round as I resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me. * **** <div class="bookquote">``I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe
<p/>, I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness, that I must abridge this narrative.
<p/>There is no confusion or failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers.
<p/>Towards the last, I could understand some few syllables that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said to me, by placing my ear close to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lips.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lingered for a week. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked me where she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was, and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); who I was, and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>It was in vain that I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) family name. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) faintly shook her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head upon the pillow, and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) secret, as the boy had done.
<p/>I had no opportunity of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) any question, until I had told the brothers she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was sinking fast, and could not live another day.
<p/>Until then, though no one was ever presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) consciousness save the woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there.
<p/>But when it came to that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); as if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too.
<p/>I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brother's -LRB-as I call him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)-RRB- having crossed swords with a peasant, and that peasant a boy.
<p/>The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading to the family, and was ridiculous.
<p/>As often as I caught the younger brother's eyes, their expression reminded me that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) disliked me deeply, for knowing what I knew from the boy.
<p/>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was smoother and more polite to me than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder, too.
<p/>My patient died, two hours before midnight--at a time, by my watch, answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>I was alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), when her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.
<p/>'' '' The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride away. I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.
<p/>''`At last she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is dead?' said the elder, when I went in. '' `She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is dead,' said I. '''I congratulate you, my brother,' were his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) words as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) turned round.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) now gave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand, but laid it on the table.
<p/>I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept nothing. '' `Pray excuse me,' said I. `Under the circumstances, no.'
<p/>They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to them, and we parted without another word on either side.
<p/>'' * **** <div class="bookquote">``I am weary, weary, weary--worn down by misery. I cannot read what I have written with this gaunt hand.
<p/>Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a little box, with my name on the outside.
<p/>I decided, that day, to write privately to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the circumstances.
<p/>I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind.
<p/>I had kept the matter a profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state in my letter.
<p/>I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>From the first, I had anxiously considered what I ought to do. '' I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that night.
<p/>The letter was lying before me just completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me.
<p/>I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. It was the last day of the year. *
<p/>**** <div class="bookquote">``I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div>The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long life. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was in great agitation. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde.
<p/>I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately.
<p/>I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I know not at what times I may be watched.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had in part suspected, and in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband's share in it, and my being resorted to.
<p/>'' My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not know that the girl was dead.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hope had been to avert the wrath of Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) greatest desire was, to help that sister.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hope had been, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said in great distress, to show her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), in secret, a woman's sympathy. '' I could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nothing but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope that I could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) the name and place of abode.
<p/>Whereas, to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both. * **** '' These scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a warning, yesterday.
<p/>I must finish my record to-day. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) marriage. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) be!
<p/>The brother distrusted and disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) influence was all opposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) stood in dread of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and in dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband too.
<p/>When I handed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) down to the door, there was a child, a pretty boy from two to three years old, in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) carriage.
<p/>`For his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sake, Doctor,' she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said, pointing to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in tears, 'I would do all I can to make what poor amends I can.
<p/>I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>What I have left to call my own--it is little beyond the worth of a few jewels--I will make it the first charge of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life to bestow, with the compassion and lamenting of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dead mother, on this injured family, if the sister can be discovered.'
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will never prosper in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) inheritance otherwise. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) kissed the boy, and said, caressing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), `It is for thine own dear sake.
<p/>Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?' The child answered her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bravely, `Yes!' I kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) arms, and went away caressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband's name in the faith that I knew it, I added no mention of it to my letter.
<p/>I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) more. '' I sealed my letter, and, not trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.
<p/>That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o'clock, a man in a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs.
<p/>'' When my servant came into the room where I sat with my wife-- O my wife, beloved of my heart!
<p/>My fair young English wife!--we saw the man, who was supposed to be at the gate, standing silent behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). ''
<p/>An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. It would not detain me, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a coach in waiting.
<p/>When I was clear of the house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and my arms were pinioned.
<p/>'' It brought me here, it brought me to my grave. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner, and identified me with a single gesture.
<p/>The Marquis took from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) foot.
<p/>If it had pleased God to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or dead--I might have thought that He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not quite abandoned them.
<p/>But, now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that they have no part in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mercies.
<p/>And them and their descendants, to the last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for.
<p/>Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my living grave. '' I denounce them to Heaven and to earth.
<p/>'' A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood.
<p/>The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time, and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.
<p/>Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their time.
<p/>Little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register.
<p/>The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in that place that day, against such denunciation.
<p/>And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a well-known citizen, his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) own attached friend, the father of his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) wife.
<p/>One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and self-immolations on the people's altar.
<p/>Therefore when the President said -LRB-else had his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) own head quivered on his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) shoulders-RRB-, that the good physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) daughter a widow and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) child
<p/>an orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of human sympathy. '' Much influence around him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>), has that Doctor?
<p/>'' murmured Madame Defarge, smiling to The Vengeance. '' Save him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) now, my Doctor, save him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)! '' At every juryman's vote, there was a roar.
<p/>Another and another. Roar and roar. Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People.
<p/>The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under the sentence, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been mortally stricken.
<p/>But, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) uttered no sound; and so strong was the voice within her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), representing that it was she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of all the world who must uphold him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misery and not augment it, that it quickly raised her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), even from that shock.
<p/>Back to the Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours! XI. Dusk The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors, the Tribunal adjourned.
<p/>The quick noise and movement of the court's emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) arms towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) husband, with nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) face but love and consolation.
<p/>'' If I might touch him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)! If I might embrace him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) once! O, good citizens, if you would have so much compassion for us!
<p/>There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last night, and Barsad.
<p/>'' The people had all poured out to the show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, <div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) embrace him (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) then; it is but a moment.
<p/>It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>), by leaning over the dock, could fold her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>) arms.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), and would have fallen on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knees to both of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), crying: <div class="bookquote">``No, no!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old.
<p/>We know, now what you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) dear sake.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father's only answer was to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands through his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) white hair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish.
<p/>We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and duty. Heaven be with you!'' '' It could not be otherwise,'' said the prisoner.
<p/>'' All things have worked together as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain endeavour to discharge my poor mother's trust that first brought my fatal presence near you.
<p/>Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive me.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was drawn away, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wife released him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and stood looking after him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and with a radiant look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face, in which there was even a comforting smile.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) went out at the prisoners' door, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) turned, laid her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head lovingly on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father's breast, tried to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and fell at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feet.
<p/>Heaven bless you!'' Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never moved, Sydney Carton came and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) up.
<p/>Only her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) father and Mr. Lorry were with her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm trembled as it raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), and supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) head. Yet, there was an air about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) that was not all of pity--that had a flush of pride in it.
<p/>'' Shall I take her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) to a coach? I shall never feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) weight. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) lightly to the door, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) tenderly down in a coach.
<p/>When they arrived at the gateway where he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had paused in the dark not many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) feet had trodden, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) again, and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) up the staircase to their rooms.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) father and their old friend got into it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seat beside the driver. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) down on a couch, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) child and Miss Pross wept over her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>).
<p/>'' Don't recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) to herself,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, softly, to the latter, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) is better so. Don't revive her (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) to consciousness, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) only faints.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucie/Miss Lucie</b></font>)</div>cried little Lucie, springing up and throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) arms passionately round him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), in a burst of grief.
<p/>'' Now that you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to save papa! O, look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), dear Carton!
<p/>Can you, of all the people who love her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), bear to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) so? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) bent over the child, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) blooming cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) gently from him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) unconscious mother. '' Before I go,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) said, and paused--<div class="bookquote">``I may kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was remembered afterwards that when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) bent down and touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) murmured some words.
<p/>The child, who was nearest to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), told them afterwards, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) grandchildren when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) was a handsome old lady, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) say, ``A life you love.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had gone out into the next room, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father, who were following, and said to the latter: <div class="bookquote">``You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least be tried.
<p/>These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the strongest assurances that I should save him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); and I did.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) returned the answer in great trouble, and very slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few and short, but try.
<p/>I have known such energy as yours do great things before now--though never,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) added, with a smile and a sigh together, <div class="bookquote">``such great things as this.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I intend to try. I will not rest a moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That's well. But try! Of little worth as life is when we misuse it, it is worth that effort.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div>said Doctor Manette, <div class="bookquote">``to the Prosecutor and the President straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name.
<p/>It would cost nothing to lay down if it were not.''  (<font color='red'><b>Manette/Miss Manette</b></font>)</div>I will write too, and--But stay! There is a Celebration in the streets, and no one will be accessible until dark.''
<p/>'' That's true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the forlorner for being delayed till dark.
<p/>I should like to know how you speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have seen these dread powers, Doctor Manette?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from this. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It will be dark soon after four.
<p/>If I go to Mr. Lorry's at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from our friend or from yourself?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) on the shoulder as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was going away, caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) to turn.
<p/>Let us stretch the hour or two. <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' May you prosper! '' '' I have no hope,'' said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>)--which is a large supposition; for what is his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) life, or any man's to
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>Nor have I. them!--I doubt if they durst spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) after the demonstration in the court. '' '' And so do I.
<p/>I heard the fall of the axe in that sound. '' Mr. Lorry leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arm upon the door-post, and bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face upon it.
<p/>'' Don't despond,'' said Carton, very gently; <div class="bookquote">``don't grieve. I encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>).
<p/>Otherwise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>) might think `his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) life was wantonly thrown away or wasted,' and that might trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, yes, yes,'' returned Mr. Lorry, drying his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``you are right.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) will perish; there is no real hope. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) will perish: there is no real hope,'' echoed Carton.
<p/>And walked with a settled step, down-stairs. XII. Darkness Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go.
<p/>'' At Tellson's banking-house at nine,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said, with a musing face. '' Shall I do well, in the mean time, to show myself?
<p/>I think so. It is best that these people should know there is such a man as I here ; it is a sound precaution, and may be a necessary preparation.
<p/>Checking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind to its possible consequences.
<p/>But care, care, care! Let me think it out!'' His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first impression was confirmed. '' It is best,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, finally resolved, <div class="bookquote">``that these people should know there is such a man as I here.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face towards Saint Antoine. Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb.
<p/>Having ascertained its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner.
<p/>It was not difficult for one who knew the city well, to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) house without asking any question. For the first time in many years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) had no strong drink.
<p/>Since last night he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) had dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry's hearth like a man who had done with it.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed along towards Saint Antoine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) loose cravat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) coat-collar, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) wild hair.
<p/>It was as late as seven o'clock when he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) awoke refreshed, and went out into the streets again. This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) went on direct to Defarge's, and went in.
<p/>This man, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen upon the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the Defarges, man and wife.
<p/>There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the restless fingers and the croaking voice. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like a regular member of the establishment.
<p/>As Carton walked in, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) seat and asked -LRB-in very indifferent French-RRB- for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) herself, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) what it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) had ordered.
<p/>After looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), as if the sound of even a single French word were slow to express itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) answered, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) former strong foreign accent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) repeated what he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) had already said. <div class="bookquote">``English? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dark eyebrows. '' Yes, madame, yes.
<p/>Madame Defarge returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) counter to get the wine, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) say, <div class="bookquote">``I swear to you, like Evremonde!
<p/>I am English!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Defarge brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) the wine, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) Good Evening. <div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good evening. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! Good evening, citizen,'' filling his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) glass.
<p/>'' Ah! and good wine. I drink to the Republic. '' Defarge went back to the counter, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Certainly, a little like.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>Madame sternly retorted, <div class="bookquote">``I tell you a good deal like. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Jacques Three pacifically remarked, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) is so much in your mind, see you, madame.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, my faith! And you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) once more to-morrow!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Carton followed the lines and words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) paper, with a slow forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning their arms on the counter close together, speaking low.
<p/>After a silence of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) without disturbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed their conversation.
<p/>'' It is true what madame says,'' observed Jacques Three. '' Why stop? There is great force in that. Why stop?''
<p/>'' Well, well,'' reasoned Defarge, <div class="bookquote">``but one must stop somewhere. After all, the question is still where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At extermination,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said madame.
<p/>'' Magnificent! '' croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly approved. '' Extermination is good doctrine, my wife,'' said Defarge, rather troubled; <div class="bookquote">``in general, I say nothing against it.
<p/>But this Doctor has suffered much; you have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to-day; you have observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face when the paper was read.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily. '' Yes. I have observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face. I have observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face to be not the face of a true friend of the Republic.
<p/>And you have observed, my wife,'' said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner, <div class="bookquote">``the anguish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div><p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) take care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) face!'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I have observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated madame; <div class="bookquote">``yes, I have observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter, more times than one.
<p/>I have observed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to-day, and I have observed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) other days. I have observed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in the court, and I have observed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in the street by the prison.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) seemed to raise it -LRB-the listener's eyes were always on his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) paper-RRB-, and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), as if the axe had dropped.
<p/>Let me but lift my finger--!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' The citizeness is superb!'' croaked the Juryman. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is an Angel!'' said The Vengeance, and embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
<p/>As to thee,'' pursued madame, implacably, addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``if it depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this man even now.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>protested Defarge. '' Not if to lift this glass would do it! But I would leave the matter there.
<p/>I say, stop there.'' <div class="bookquote">``See you then, Jacques,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; <div class="bookquote">``and see you, too, my little Vengeance; see you both!
<p/>For other crimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register, doomed to destruction and extermination.
<p/>In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) finds this paper of to-day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacques</b></font>) brings it home, and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot, by the light of this lamp.
<p/>Listen! Ask my husband, is that so.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>assented Defarge, without being asked. '' Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), is that so.''
<p/>That night, I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), when the paper is read through, and the lamp is burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge</b></font>)</div>assented Defarge. '' Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), is that so.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>assented Defarge again. '' I communicate to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that secret.
<p/>I smite this bosom with these two hands as I smite it now, and I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), `Defarge, I was brought up among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my family.
<p/>Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister, that husband was my sister's husband, that unborn child was their child
<p/>, that brother was my brother, that father was my father, those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things descends to me!'
<p/>Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), is that so.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Defarge/Monsieur Defarge/Monsieur</b></font>)</div>assented Defarge once more. '' Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop,'' returned madame; <div class="bookquote">``but don't tell me.
<p/>Both her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wrath--the listener could feel how white she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was, without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)--and both highly commended it.
<p/>Defarge, a weak minority, interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but only elicited from his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) own wife a repetition of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) last reply.
<p/>The English customer paid for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had had, perplexedly counted his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) change, and asked, as a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Customers</b></font>)</div>Customers entered, and the group was broken up. Madame Defarge took him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) to the door, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arm on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>), in pointing out the road.
<p/>The English customer was not without his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) reflections then, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and deep.
<p/>At the appointed hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) emerged from it to present himself in Mr. Lorry's room again, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had been with Lucie until just now, and had only left her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) for a few minutes, to come and keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) appointment.
<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) went his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father had not been seen, since he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quitted the banking-house towards four o'clock.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) had some faint hopes that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been more than five hours gone: where could he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) be?
<p/>Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) should go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), and come to the banking-house again at midnight.
<p/>In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette did not come back.
<p/>They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) prolonged absence, when they heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) on the stairs.
<p/>Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), and brought none. Where could he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) be? The instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) entered the room, it was plain that all was lost.
<p/>Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had really been to any one, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had been all that time traversing the streets, was never known.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) stood staring at them, they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) no question, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face told them everything. '' I cannot find it,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I must have it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) head and throat were bare, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) spoke with a helpless look straying all around, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) coat off, and let it drop on the floor.
<p/>Where is it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I can't find it.
<p/>What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must finish those shoes. '' They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come!

It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), or try to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sank into the chair, and brooded over the embers, and shed tears.
<p/>As if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) shrink into the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.
<p/>Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lonely daughter, bereft of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) final hope and reliance, appealed to them both too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces.
<p/>Carton was the first to speak: <div class="bookquote">``The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had better be taken to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say on. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro, and moaning.
<p/>They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the night.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to carry the lists of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) day's duties, fell lightly on the floor.
<p/>Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) feet. Carton took it up, and there was a folded paper in it.
<p/>'' We should look at this!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said. Mr. Lorry nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) consent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) opened it, and exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Thank God! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>First,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) coat, and took another paper from it, <div class="bookquote">``that is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city.

<p/>I never doubted until within this hour or two, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had, or could have such a paper. It is good, until recalled.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) helped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers, as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in the memorable time when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own desolate heart to it--outwatched the awful night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room.
<p/>'' And I hope to do mine. Now, good bye! '' Before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went away, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breathed a blessing towards it, and a Farewell.
<p/>XIII. Fifty-two In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited their fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year.
<p/>Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday, the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set apart.
<p/>Fifty-two were to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea. Two score and twelve were told off.
<p/>From the farmer-general of seventy, whose riches could not buy his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose poverty and obscurity could not save her (<font color='blue'><b>seamstress</b></font>).
<p/>Physical diseases, engendered in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees; and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering, intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally without distinction.
<p/>Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) came to it from the Tribunal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could avail him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) nothing.
<p/>Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) beloved wife fresh before him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), to compose his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) mind to what it must bear.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) hold on life was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) strength to bear on that hand and it yielded, this was closed again.
<p/>There was a hurry, too, in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) thoughts, a turbulent and heated working of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) heart, that contended against resignation.
<p/>If, for a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) did feel resigned, then his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) wife and child who had to live after him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>), seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing.
<p/>Before long, the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) must meet, and that numbers went the same road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).
<p/>Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) quiet fortitude.
<p/>So, by degrees he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) calmed into the better state, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) could raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.
<p/>Before it had set in dark on the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) condemnation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had travelled thus far on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) last way.
<p/>Being allowed to purchase the means of writing, and a light, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had known nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father's imprisonment, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had heard of it from herself, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had been as ignorant as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) father's and uncle's responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had already explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) concealment from herself of the name he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had still exacted on the morning of their marriage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father's sake, never to seek to know whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) -LRB-for the moment, or for good-RRB-, by the story of the Tower, on that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there, and which had been described to all the world.
<p/>In every line of the narrative he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had heard, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) condemnation. But, all this was at first. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) besought her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) added that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew it was needless--to console her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father, by impressing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) through every tender
<p/>means she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could think of, with the truth that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had done nothing for which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could justly reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes.
<p/>Next to her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) preservation of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own last grateful love and blessing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) overcoming of her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) adjured her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father.
<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrote in the same strain; but, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) expressly confided his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife and child to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) care.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) foresaw he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might be tending.
<p/>To Mr. Lorry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) commended them all, and explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) worldly affairs. That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment, all was done.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) never thought of Carton. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind was so full of the others, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) never once thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) lay down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) straw bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had done with this world. But, it beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) sleep, and showed itself in shining forms.
<p/>Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho -LRB-though it had nothing in it like the real house-RRB-, unaccountably released and light of heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was with Lucie again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) it was all a dream, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had never gone away.
<p/>A pause of forgetfulness, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had even suffered, and had come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>), dead and at peace, and yet there was no difference in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>).
<p/>Another pause of oblivion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) awoke in the sombre morning, unconscious where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was or what had happened, until it flashed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind, <div class="bookquote">``this is the day of my death!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And now, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was composed, and hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) waking thoughts, which was very difficult to master.
<p/>Thus, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads were to fall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) life.
<p/>how many steps it had, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would be stood, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed red, which way his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) face would be turned, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would be the first, or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise directed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless times.
<p/>Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), than his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) own.
<p/>The hours went on as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the numbers he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would never hear again.
<p/>How high it was from the ground, Neither were they connected with fear: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) was conscious of no fear. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away.
<p/>After a hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had got the better of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) walked up and down, softly repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for himself and for them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) would be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets.
<p/>Therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) resolved to keep Two before his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.
<p/>Walking regularly to and fro with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) arms folded on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) breast, a very different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) heard One struck away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), without surprise.
<p/>Twelve gone for ever. The hour had measured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) recovered self-possession, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``There is but another now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and turned to walk again.
<p/>Before the door was opened, or as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has never seen me here; I have kept out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way.
<p/>Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped. The key was put in the lock, and turned. Go you in alone; I wait near.
<p/>The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face to face, quiet, intent upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with the light of a smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) features, and a cautionary finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lip, Sydney Carton.
<p/>There was something so bright and remarkable in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look, that, for the first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) to be an apparition of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own imagining.
<p/>Lose no time! ''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) spoke, and it was his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) voice; he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) took the prisoner's hand, and it was his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) real grasp.
<p/>'' Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said. '' I could not believe it to be you.
<p/>I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here, and in virtue of it I stand before you.
<p/>I can scarcely believe it now. You are not''--the apprehension came suddenly into his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) mind--<div class="bookquote">``a prisoner?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No. I come from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)--your wife, dear Darnay.

'' I bring you a request from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). '' '' What is it?'' '' The prisoner turned his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) face partly aside.
<p/>You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have no time to tell you.
<p/>'' You must comply with it--take off those boots you wear, and draw on these of mine. '' There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.
<p/>Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) down into it, and stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), barefoot. ''
<p/>Draw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your will to them. Quick!'' <div class="bookquote">``Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done.
<p/>You will only die with me. It is madness.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I?

<p/>With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action, that appeared quite supernatural, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) forced all these changes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The prisoner</b></font>)</div>The prisoner was like a young child in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hands. '' Carton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed.

<p/>Carton, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) right hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) breast, stood close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>). '' Write exactly as I speak.'' '' To whom do I address it?''

<p/>`If you remember,''' said Carton, dictating, ''`the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.
<p/>Carton, standing over him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) breast, looked down. '' You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) breast; the prisoner chancing to look up in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hurried wonder as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something.
<p/>'' '' Have you written `forget them'? '' Carton asked. '' I have. Is that a weapon in your hand?'' ''
<p/>No; I am not armed. '' '' What is it in your hand?'' <div class="bookquote">``You shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said these words with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) eyes fixed on the writer, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer's face.
<p/>'' The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) vacantly. '' What vapour is that?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vapour?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Something that crossed me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen and finish.
<p/>Hurry, hurry! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>As if his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) memory were impaired, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) attention.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) hand again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>) breast--looked steadily at him (<font color='blue'><b>Darnay</b></font>).
<p/>''`If it had been otherwise;''' Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; '''I never should have used the longer opportunity.
<p/>If it had been otherwise;''' the hand was at the prisoner's face; '''I should but have had so much the more to answer for.
<p/>'' Hurry, hurry! '' The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. If it had been otherwise--''' Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs.
<p/>The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) round the waist.
<p/>For a few seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) life for him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>); but, within a minute or so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) was stretched insensible on the ground.
<p/>Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) heart was, Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn.
<p/>Carton's hand moved back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) breast no more. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) softly called, <div class="bookquote">``Enter there! Come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the Spy presented himself.
<p/>You see?'' said Carton, looking up, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: <div class="bookquote">``is your hazard very great?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Carton,'' the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) fingers, <div class="bookquote">``my hazard is not that , in the thick of business here, if you are true to the whole of your bargain.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you take me out.

 (<font color='red'><b>Man man Carton</b></font>)</div><p/>The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) forehead on his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.
<p/>'' How, then?'' said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. '' So afflicted to find that his (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of Sainte Guillotine?''
<p/>They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A good patriot,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, <div class="bookquote">``could hardly have been more afflicted if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Spy</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>The time is short, Evremonde,'' said the Spy, in a warning voice. '' I know it well,'' answered Carton. '' Be careful of my friend, I entreat you, and leave me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, then, my children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Barsad/Barsad</b></font>)</div>said Barsad. <div class="bookquote">``Lift him (<font color='blue'><b>Barsad</b></font>), and come away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Carton/Carton</b></font>)</div>The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) powers of listening to the utmost, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm.
<p/>There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed, footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry made, that seemed unusual.
<p/>Breathing more freely in a little while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.
<p/>Sounds that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) was not afraid of, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) divined their meaning, then began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and finally his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) own.
<p/>A gaoler, with a list in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) hand, looked in, merely saying, <div class="bookquote">``Follow me, Evremonde!''  (<font color='red'><b>A gaoler</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) followed into a large dark room, at a distance.
<p/>It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows within, and what with the shadows without, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound.
<p/>Some were standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion; but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking fixedly at the ground.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>) stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two were brought in after him (<font color='blue'><b>Carton</b></font>), one man stopped in passing, to embrace him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as having a knowledge of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>A very few moments after that, a young woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from the seat where he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had observed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sitting, and came to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>).
<p/>It thrilled him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) with a great dread of discovery; but the man went on. '' Citizen Evremonde,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cold hand.
<p/>'' I am a poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) murmured for answer: <div class="bookquote">``True. I forget what you were accused of?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Plots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is it likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The forlorn smile with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said it, so touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>), that tears started from his (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) eyes. '' I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing.
<p/>I am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be, Citizen Evremonde.
<p/>As the last thing on earth that his (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) heart was to warm and soften to, it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.
<p/>Such a poor weak little creature! '' '' I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was true?'' <div class="bookquote">``It was.
<p/>But, I was again taken and condemned.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold your hand?
<p/>I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me more courage. '' As the patient eyes were lifted to his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) saw a sudden doubt in them, and then astonishment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young fingers, and touched his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) lips. '' Are you dying for him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Citizen</b></font>) whispered. ''
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) wife and child. Hush! Yes.'' <div class="bookquote">``O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last.

<p/>Alexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>)? '' This is he (<font color='blue'><b>Manette</b></font>); this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man pointed out. ''
<p/>Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right mind? The Revolution-fever will have been too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? '' Greatly too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' Hah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter. French. Which is she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)? '' This is she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>). '' Apparently it must be.
<p/>Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not? '' It is. '' Hah! Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) child.
<p/>English. This is she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>)?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucie</b></font>) and no other. '' Kiss me, child of Evremonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican; something new in thy family; remember it!
<p/>Sydney Carton. Advocate. English. Which is he (<font color='blue'><b>Advocate</b></font>)? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Advocate</b></font>) lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Advocate</b></font>), too, is pointed out.
<p/>It is represented that he (<font color='blue'><b>Advocate</b></font>) is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the Republic.
<p/>'' Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon? '' It is hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) will recover in the fresher air. ''
<p/>Is that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under the displeasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window.
<p/>Jarvis Lorry. Banker. English. Which is he (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am he (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>). Necessarily, being the last. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lorry/Mr. Jarvis/Mr. Jarvis Lorry</b></font>)</div>It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions.
<p/>It is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) hand on the coach door, replying to a group of officials.
<p/>They leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.
<p/>'' Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.'' <div class="bookquote">``One can depart, citizen?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' One can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!''

<p/>There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller. '' Are we not going too slowly?
<p/>Can they not be induced to go faster?'' asks Lucie, clinging to the old man. '' It would seem like flight, my darling.
<p/>I must not urge them too much; it would rouse suspicion.'' <div class="bookquote">``Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless trees.
<p/>'' The road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued. '' The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on either side.
<p/>Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and sloughs there.
<p/>The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing anything but stopping.
<p/>Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes, avenues of leafless trees.
<p/>Have these men deceived us, and taken us back by another road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven, no.
<p/>Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible existence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results.
<p/>All the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.
<p/>A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush! the posting-house. At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left behind.
<p/>We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and on the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their haunches.
<p/>We are pursued? '' Ho! Within the carriage there. Speak then!'' '' What is it?'' asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.
<p/>'' How many did they say?'' <div class="bookquote">``I do not understand you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''--At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifty-two. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have it forty-two; ten more heads are worth having.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) moves more; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) is beginning to revive, and to speak intelligibly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) thinks they are still together; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) asks him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>), by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) name, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) has in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorry</b></font>) hand.
<p/>The Guillotine goes handsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop! '' The night comes on dark. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help us!
<p/>The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.
<p/>In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury.
<p/>Not in the wine-shop did Madame Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer, erst a mender of roads.
<p/>The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.
<p/>Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued. XIV. The Knitting Done '' But our Defarge,'' said Jacques Three, <div class="bookquote">``is undoubtedly a good Republican?
<p/>Eh?''

<p/>do I feel, since last night, that I dare not confide to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the details of my projects; but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) giving warning, and then they might escape.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><p/>Not only '' That must never be,'' croaked Jacques Three; ``no one must escape. We have not half enough as it is.

<p/>I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes. '' '' Clearly plots,'' said Jacques Three. '' Transparently!'' ''
<p/>There is no doubt of the Jury? '' inquired Madame Defarge, letting her (<font color='blue'><b>sawyer</b></font>) eyes turn to him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) with a gloomy smile.
<p/>'' Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my fellow-Jurymen.'' <div class="bookquote">``Now, let me see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge, pondering again.
<p/>'' Yet once more! Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can I spare him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would count as one head,'' observed Jacques Three, in a low voice. '' We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>) was signalling with her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) when I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),'' argued Madame Defarge; <div class="bookquote">``I cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and trust the case wholly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Three</b></font>), this little citizen here.
<p/>The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>'' For, I am not a bad witness. '' The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to be a celestial witness.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) must take his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) chance,'' said Madame Defarge. '' No, I cannot spare him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)! You are engaged at three o'clock; you are going to see the batch of to-day executed.--You?
<p/>The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was the most ardent of Republicans, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans, if anything prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was so very demonstrative herein, that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) might have been suspected -LRB-perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) out of Madame Defarge's head-RRB- of having his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) small individual fears for his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) own personal safety, every hour in the day.
<p/>After it is over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we will give information against these people at my Section.
<p/>'' '' I,'' said madame, <div class="bookquote">``am equally engaged at the same place. ''  (<font color='red'><b>madame</b></font>)</div>The wood-sawyer said he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness.
<p/>The citizeness looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) became embarrassed, evaded her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) wood, and hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) confusion over the handle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) saw.
<p/>Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to the door, and there expounded her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) further views to them thus:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antoine</b></font>) death. She (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) will be mourning and grieving. She (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the Republic.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) will be full of sympathy with its enemies. I will go to her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacques Three</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Jacques Three, rapturously.
<p/>Take you my knitting,'' said Madame Defarge, placing it in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lieutenant's hands, <div class="bookquote">``and have it ready for me in my usual seat.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>lieutenant</b></font>)</div>Ah, my cherished!'' cried The Vengeance; and embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). '' Keep me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual, to-day.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I willingly obey the orders of my Chief,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said The Vengeance with alacrity, and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheek. '' You will not be late?''
<p/>Be sure you are there, my soul,'' said The Vengeance, calling after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had already turned into the street, ``before the tumbrils arrive!
<p/>Madame Defarge slightly waved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, to imply that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard, and might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the mud, and round the corner of the prison wall.
<p/>The Vengeance and the Juryman, looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walked away, were highly appreciative of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fine figure, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) superb moral endowments.
<p/>There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way along the streets.
<p/>Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have heaved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up, under any circumstances.
<p/>But, imbued from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into a tigress.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be there before the commencement.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And before the tumbrils arrive. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was absolutely without pity. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had ever had the virtue in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), it had quite gone out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>It was nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forefathers; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw, not him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but them.
<p/>It was nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife was to be made a widow and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) natural enemies and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) prey, and as such had no right to live.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been engaged, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would not have pitied herself; nor, if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) there.
<p/>To appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), was made hopeless by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) having no sense of pity, even for herself. Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) rough robe.
<p/>Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) dark hair looked rich under her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) coarse red cap.
<p/>Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way along the streets.
<p/>Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night, the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's attention.
<p/>It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach, but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.
<p/>Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at three o'clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.
<p/>Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and, passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.
<p/>Lying hidden in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) waist, was a sharpened dagger. Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) and Jerry had beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.
<p/>Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,'' said Miss Pross, whose agitation was so great that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live: <div class="bookquote">``what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Another carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken suspicion. '' '' My opinion, miss,'' returned Mr. Cruncher, ``is as you're right.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, wildly crying, <div class="bookquote">``that I am incapable of forming any plan.
<p/>Likewise wot I'll stand by you, right or wrong. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>Are you capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Respectin' a future spear o' life, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Cruncher, <div class="bookquote">``I hope so. Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o' mine, I think not.
<p/>Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o' two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>'' cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, <div class="bookquote">``record them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``First,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage, ``them poor things well out o
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``that you never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh, for gracious sake! ' this, never no more will I do it, never no more!'' <div class="bookquote">``No, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>returned Jerry, <div class="bookquote">``it shall not be named to you.
<p/>Second: them poor things well out o' this, and never no more will I interfere with Mrs. Cruncher's flopping, never no more!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><p/>Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,'' said Miss Pross, striving to dry her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) eyes and compose herself, <div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt it is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) own superintendence.--O my poor darlings!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--<div class="bookquote">``and let my words be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my opinions respectin' flopping has undergone a change, and that wot
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present time. '' ''
<p/>I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) is, my dear man,'' cried the distracted Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``and I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) finds it answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) expectations.
<p/>Forbid it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity, additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out, <div class="bookquote">``as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now!
<p/>There, there, there! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>'' Forbid it as we shouldn't all flop -LRB-if it was anyways conwenient-RRB- to get 'em out
<p/>o' this here dismal risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for- bid it! '' This was Mr. Cruncher's conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.
<p/>If we ever get back to our native land,'' said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``you may rely upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time.
<p/>And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) way along the streets, came nearer and nearer. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr. Cruncher, let us think!
<p/>If you were to go before,'' said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn't that be best?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) way along the streets, came nearer and nearer. '' '' Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.
<p/>'' Where could you wait for me?'' asked Miss Pross. Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) could think of no locality but Temple Bar.
<p/>Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed. '' By the cathedral door,'' said Miss Pross.
<p/>Would it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``No, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Cruncher. '' Then, like the best of men,'' said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``go to the posting-house straight, and make that change.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am doubtful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``about leaving of you, you see. We don't know what may happen.
<p/>Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o'Clock, or as near it as you can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from here.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>'' Heaven knows we don't,'' returned Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``but have no fear for me. I feel certain of it. There!
<p/>Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives that may depend on both of us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>), decided Mr. Cruncher.
<p/>With an encouraging nod or two, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) by herself to follow as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had proposed.
<p/>The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another relief.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) watch, and it was twenty minutes past two. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.
<p/>Afraid, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) eyes, which were swollen and red.
<p/>Haunted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) feverish apprehensions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) could not bear to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>).
<p/>In one of those pauses she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) recoiled and cried out, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) saw a figure standing in the room. The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge.
<p/>By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood, those feet had come to meet that water. Madame Defarge looked coldly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">``The wife of Evremonde; where is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open, and would suggest the flight. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) first act was to shut them.
<p/>There were four in the room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) shut them all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) then placed herself before the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.
<p/>Miss Pross had nothing beautiful about her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>); years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) appearance; but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) too was a determined woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) different way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) measured Madame Defarge with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) eyes, every inch.
<p/>Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) through this rapid movement, and rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) when it was finished. '' You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,'' said Miss Pross, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) breathing.
<p/>Madame Defarge looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) scornfully, but still with something of Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) saw a tight, hard, wiry woman before her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew full well that Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy.
<p/>On my way yonder,'' said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) hand towards the fatal spot, <div class="bookquote">``where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) in passing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of me. I am an Englishwoman. '' '' I wish to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that your intentions are evil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``and you may depend upon it, I'll hold my own against them.
<p/>Each spoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) own language; neither understood the other's words; both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what the unintelligible words meant.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>'' It will do her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment,'' said Madame Defarge. ''
<p/>Good patriots will know what that means. Let me see her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>). Go tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) that I wish to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>). Do you hear?''
<p/>'' If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,'' returned Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``and I was an English four-poster , they shouldn't loose a splinter of me.
<p/>Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail; but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) so far understood them as to perceive that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was set at naught.
<p/>No, you wicked foreign woman; I am your match. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>'' Woman imbecile and pig-like!'' said Madame Defarge, frowning. '' I take no answer from you.
<p/>Either tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) that I demand to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>), or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>)!''
<p/>I little thought,'' said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``that I should ever want to understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have, except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any part of it.
<p/>I demand to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>). This, with an angry explanatory wave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) right arm. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>'' Neither of them for a single moment released the other's eyes.
<p/>Madame Defarge had not moved from the spot where she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) stood when Miss Pross first became aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>); but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) now advanced one step.
<p/>'' I am a Briton,'' said Miss Pross, <div class="bookquote">``I am desperate. I don't care an English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the greater hope there is for my Ladybird.
<p/>Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head and a flash of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) eyes between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.
<p/>I'll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) life.
<p/>But, her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) eyes. This was a courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness.
<p/>'' Ha, ha!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that Doctor. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) voice and called out, <div class="bookquote">``Citizen Doctor!
<p/>Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.
<p/>Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Three of the doors she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) opened swiftly, and looked in.
<p/>'' Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind you!
<p/>Let me look. '' <div class="bookquote">``Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer. ''
<p/>If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back,'' said Madame Defarge to herself.
<p/>As long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do,'' said Miss Pross to herself; ``and you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Defarge</b></font>)</div>said Madame Defarge.
<p/>We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here, while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling,'' said Miss Pross.
<p/>Miss Pross, on the instinct of the moment, seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) round the waist in both her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) arms, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) tight.
<p/>'' '' '' Madame Defarge made at the door. It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike;
<p/>Miss Pross, with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate, clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) tight, and even lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) from the floor in the struggle that they had.
<p/>The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) face; but, Miss Pross, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) head down, held her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) round the waist, and clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) with more than the hold of a drowning woman.
<p/>Soon, Madame Defarge's hands ceased to strike, and felt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) encircled waist. '' It is under my arm,'' said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, <div class="bookquote">``you shall not draw it.
<p/>I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold you till one or other of us faints or dies!
<p/>Miss Pross looked up, saw what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood alone--blinded with smoke.
<p/>As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground.
<p/>In the first fright and horror of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) situation, Miss Pross passed the body as far from it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) could, and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>Madame Defarge's hands were at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) bosom. All this was in a second. Happily, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) bethought herself of the consequences of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) did, in time to check herself and go back.
<p/>It was dreadful to go in at the door again; but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) did go in, and even went near it, to get the bonnet and other things that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) must wear.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.
<p/>By good fortune she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) had a veil on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) bonnet, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped.
<p/>These she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) put on, out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key. By good fortune, too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) needed both advantages, for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair was torn, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress -LRB-hastily composed with unsteady hands-RRB- was clutched and dragged a hundred ways.
<p/>Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) escort, and waiting there, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains discovered, what if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and charged with murder!
<p/>In crossing the bridge, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dropped the door key in the river. In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the escort appeared, took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) away.
<p/>'' Is there any noise in the streets? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). '' The usual noises,'' Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the question and by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aspect.
<p/>'' I don't hear you,'' said Miss Pross. '' What do you say? '' It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) said; Miss Pross could not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>).
<p/>'' So I'll nod my head,'' thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, <div class="bookquote">``at all events she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)'ll see that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) did. ''
<p/>Is there any noise in the streets now?'' asked Miss Pross again, presently. Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) head. '' I don't hear it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, ``as if there had been a flash and a crash, and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone deaf in an hour?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) mind much disturbed; <div class="bookquote">``wot's come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Blest if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) ain't in a queer condition!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cruncher, more and more disturbed.
<p/>'' Wot can she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) have been a takin', to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) courage up? Hark! There's the roll of them dreadful carts!
<p/>O, my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness, and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts.''
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their journey's end,'' said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``it's my opinion that indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) never will hear anything else in this world.
<p/>You can hear that, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cruncher/Jerry/Jerry Cruncher</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Pross/Pross</b></font>)</div>said Miss Pross, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cruncher</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``nothing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>'' And indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Pross</b></font>) never did.
<p/>XV. The Footsteps Die Out For Ever Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six tumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine.
<p/>And yet there is not in France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror.
<p/>All the devouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself, are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms.
<p/>Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind.
<p/>Change these back again to what they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father's house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!
<p/>Six tumbrils roll along the streets. No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the Creator, never reverses his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) transformations.
<p/>If thou be changed into this shape by the will of God,'' say the seers to the enchanted, in the wise Arabian stories, <div class="bookquote">``then remain so!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the seers</b></font>)</div>But, if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!'' Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.
<p/>As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets.
<p/>So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils.
<p/>Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight; then he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) points his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) finger, with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.
<p/>Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with a lingering interest in the ways of life and men.
<p/>Some, seated with drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres, and in pictures.
<p/>Ridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward. Several close their eyes, and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together.
<p/>Only one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made drunk by horror, that he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) sings, and tries to dance.
<p/>There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils, and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some question.
<p/>It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart.
<p/>Not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people. The horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with their swords.
<p/>The leading curiosity is, to know which is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stands at the back of the tumbril with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head bent down, to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no curiosity or care for the scene about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and always speaks to the girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>If they move him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair a little more loosely about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot easily touch his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms being bound. On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands the Spy and prison-sheep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) looks into the first of them: not there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) looks into the second: not there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) already asks himself, <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) sacrificed me?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>when his (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) face clears, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) looks into the third.
<p/>'' Which is Evremonde?'' says a man behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' That. At the back there. '' <div class="bookquote">``With his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand in the girl's?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man cries, <div class="bookquote">``Down, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats! Down, Evremonde!''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Spy</b></font>)</div>the Spy entreats him (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>), timidly.
<p/>'' And why not, citizen?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) be at peace. '' But the man continuing to exclaim, <div class="bookquote">``Down, Evremonde!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the face of Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and end.
<p/>The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following to the Guillotine.
<p/>In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting.
<p/>Evremonde then sees the Spy, and looks attentively at him (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>), and goes his (<font color='blue'><b>Spy</b></font>) way. On one of the fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) friend.
<p/>'' Therese! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Therese</b></font>) cries, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Therese</b></font>) shrill tones. '' Who has seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Therese</b></font>)? Therese Defarge!'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Therese</b></font>) never missed before,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.
<p/>'' No; nor will she (<font color='blue'><b>Therese</b></font>) miss now,'' cries The Vengeance, petulantly. '' Therese.'' <div class="bookquote">``Louder,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman recommends. Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will scarcely hear thee.
<p/>Send other women up and down to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! ''
<p/>Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet it will hardly bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Bad Fortune! '' cries The Vengeance, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) foot in the chair, <div class="bookquote">``and here are the tumbrils!
<p/>And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not here! See her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knitting in my hand, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) empty chair ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>I cry with vexation and disappointment!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>As The Vengeance descends from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) elevation to do it, the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads.
<p/>Crash!--A head is held up, and the knitting-women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak, count One.
<p/>The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are robed and ready. The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up. Crash!--And the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.
<p/>The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next after him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has not relinquished her (<font color='blue'><b>seamstress</b></font>) patient hand in getting out, but still holds it as he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) promised.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gently places her (<font color='blue'><b>seamstress</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>seamstress</b></font>) back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she (<font color='blue'><b>seamstress</b></font>) looks into his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face and thanks him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been able to raise my thoughts to Him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) who was put to death, that we might have hope and comfort here to-day.
<p/>'' I think you were sent to me by Heaven.'' '' Or you to me,'' says Sydney Carton. '' Keep your eyes upon me, dear child, and mind no other object.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when I let it go, if they are rapid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will be rapid. Fear not! ''  (<font color='red'><b>victims</b></font>)</div>The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as if they were alone.
<p/>Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home together, and to rest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) bosom.
<p/>'' Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I am very ignorant, and it troubles me--just a little.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me what it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I love very dearly.
<p/>Poverty parted us, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) knows nothing of my fate--for I cannot write--and if I could, how should I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) is five years younger than I, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) lives in a farmer's house in the south country. It is better as it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>``What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so much support, is this:--If the Republic really does good to the poor, and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) may live a long time: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) may even live to be old.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The spare hand does not tremble as he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) releases it; nothing worse than a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) kisses his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) lips; he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other.

<p/>The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away.
<p/>'' I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: '' Twenty-Three. * **** They said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), about the city that night, that it was the peacefullest man's face ever beheld there.
<p/>One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe--a woman--had asked at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
