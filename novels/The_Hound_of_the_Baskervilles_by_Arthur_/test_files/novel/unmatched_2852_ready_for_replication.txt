$mr_sherlock_holmes$ mr $mr_sherlock_holmes$ who was usually very late in the #morning# save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all #night# was seated at the breakfast table
produced by shreevatsa the #hound# of the baskervilles by a conan doyle chapter i stood upon the hearth rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the #night# before
it was a fine thick piece of wood bulbous headed of the sort which is known as a penang lawyer just under the #head# was a broad silver band nearly an inch across
to $dr_james_mortimer$ r s from his #friend# of the c was engraved upon it with the date it was just such a stick as the old fashioned #family# practitioner used to carry dignified solid and reassuring
well $dr_watson$ what do you make of it $mr_sherlock_holmes$ was sitting with his back to me and i had given him no sign of my occupation
how did you know what i was doing i believe you have #eye# in the back of your #head# i have at least a well polished silver plated coffee pot in front of me said he
since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand this accidental souvenir becomes of importance
but tell me $dr_watson$ what do you make of our visitor stick let me hear you reconstruct the #man# by an examination of it
i think said i following as far as i could the methods of my companion that $dr_james_mortimer$ is a successful elderly medical #man# well esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation
i think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot
because this stick though originally a very handsome #one# has been so knocked about that i can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it
the thick iron ferrule is worn down so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it
good said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ excellent why so perfectly sound said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ and then again there is the #friend# of the c
i should guess that to be the #something# hunt the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance and which has made him a small presentation in return
i am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities
really $dr_watson$ you excel yourself said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette it may be that you are not yourself luminous but you are a conductor of #light#
some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it i confess my dear fellow that i am very much in your debt
he had never said as much before and i must admit that his #word# gave me keen pleasure for i had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which i had made to give publicity to his methods
i was proud too to think that i had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a #way# which earned his approval
then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette and carrying the cane to the #window# he looked over it again with a convex lens
he now took the stick from my #hand# and examined it for a few minutes with his naked #eye#
interesting though elementary said he as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee there are certainly #one# or two indications upon the stick
it gives us the basis for several deductions has #anything# escaped me i asked with some self importance i trust that there is #nothing# of consequence which i have overlooked
i am afraid my dear $dr_watson$ that most of your conclusions were erroneous when i said that you stimulated me i meant to be frank that in noting your fallacies i was occasionally guided towards the truth
not that you are entirely wrong in this instance the #man# is certainly a country practitioner and he walks a good deal
then i was right to that extent but that was all no no my dear $dr_watson$ not all by no means all
i would suggest for example that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt and that when the initials c are placed before that hospital the #word# charing cross very naturally suggest themselves
and if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor
you may be right the probability lies in that direction well then supposing that c does stand for charing cross hospital what further inferences may we draw
do none suggest themselves you know my methods apply them i can only think of the obvious conclusion that the #man# has practised in town before going to the country
i think that we might venture a little farther than this look at it in this #light# on what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made
obviously at the moment when $dr_james_mortimer$ withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for himself
when would his #friend# unite to give him a pledge of their good will we know there has been a presentation
we believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice is it then stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change
now you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital since only a #man# well established in a london practice could hold such a position and such a #one# would not drift into the country
if he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a $merripit_house$ surgeon or a $merripit_house$ physician little more than a senior student
so your grave middle aged #family# practitioner vanishes into thin air my dear $dr_watson$ and there emerges a young fellow under thirty amiable unambitious absent minded and the possessor of a favourite dog which i should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff
i laughed incredulously as $mr_sherlock_holmes$ leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling
it certainly seems probable what was he then and he left five years ago the date is on the stick
as to the latter part i have no means of checking you said i but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the #man# age and professional career
from my small medical shelf i took down the medical directory and turned up the #name# there were several mortimers but only #one# who could be our visitor
i read his record aloud $dr_james_mortimer$ $dr_james_mortimer$ r s grimpen dartmoor devon $merripit_house$ surgeon from to at charing cross hospital
winner of the jackson prize for comparative pathology with essay entitled is disease a reversion corresponding member of the swedish pathological society
author of some freaks of atavism lancet do we progress journal of psychology march medical officer for the parishes of grimpen thorsley and high barrow
no mention of that local hunt $dr_watson$ said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ with a mischievous smile but a country doctor as you very astutely observed
i think that i am fairly justified in my inferences as to the adjectives i said if i remember right amiable unambitious and absent minded
it is my experience that it is only an amiable #man# in this world who receives testimonials only an unambitious #one# who abandons a london career for the country and only an absent minded #one# who leaves his stick and not his visiting card after waiting an hour in your #room#
being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible
the dog jaw as shown in the space between these marks is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff
and the dog has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master it may have been yes by jove it is a curly haired spaniel
he had risen and paced the #room# as he spoke now he halted in the recess of the #window# there was such a ring of conviction in his voice that i glanced up in surprise
for the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our very #door# step and there is the ring of its owner
my dear fellow how can you possibly be so sure of that dont move i beg you $dr_watson$ he is a professional brother of yours and your presence may be of assistance to me
now is the dramatic moment of fate $dr_watson$ when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your #life# and you know not whether for good or ill
what does $dr_james_mortimer$ the #man# of science ask of $mr_sherlock_holmes$ the specialist in crime come in the appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me since i had expected a typical country practitioner
he was a very tall thin #man# with a long nose like a beak which jutted out between two keen gray #eye# set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold rimmed glasses
though young his long back was already bowed and he walked with a forward thrust of his #head# and a general air of peering benevolence
as he entered his #eye# fell upon the stick in $mr_sherlock_holmes$ #hand# and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy
he was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion for his frock coat was dingy and his trousers frayed i am so very glad said he
i was not sure whether i had left it here or in the shipping office i would not lose that stick for the world
a presentation i see said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ yes #sir# from charing cross hospital from #one# or two #friend# there on the occasion of my marriage
dear dear that bad said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ shaking his #head# $dr_james_mortimer$ blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment why was it bad
only that you have disarranged our little deductions your marriage you say yes #sir# i married and so left the hospital and
with it all hopes of a consulting practice it was necessary to make a home of my own come come we are not so far wrong after all said $mr_sherlock_holmes$
and now $dr_james_mortimer$ mister #sir# mister a humble r s and a #man# of precise #mind# evidently a dabbler in science $mr_sherlock_holmes$ a picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean
i presume that it is $mr_sherlock_holmes$ whom i am addressing and not no this is my #friend# $dr_watson$
glad to meet you #sir# i have heard your #name# mentioned in connection with that of your #friend# you interest me very much $mr_sherlock_holmes$
i had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well marked supra orbital development would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure
a cast of your skull #sir# until the original is available would be an ornament to any anthropological museum it is not my intention to be fulsome but i confess that i covet your skull
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ waved our strange visitor into a chair you are an enthusiast in your line of thought i perceive #sir# as i am in mine said he
i observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes have no hesitation in lighting #one# the #man# drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the #one# up in the other with surprising dexterity
he had long quivering fingers as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect $mr_sherlock_holmes$ was silent but his little darting glances showed me the interest which he took in our curious companion
i presume #sir# said he at last that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last #night# and again today
i came to you $mr_sherlock_holmes$ because i recognized that i am myself an unpractical #man# and because i am suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary problem
no #sir# no though i am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that as well recognizing as i do that you are the second highest expert in europe
indeed #sir# may i inquire who has the honour to be the first asked $mr_sherlock_holmes$ with some asperity
to the #man# of precisely scientific #mind# the work of monsieur bertillon must always appeal strongly then had you not better consult him
i said #sir# to the precisely scientific #mind# but as a practical #man# of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone
i think $dr_james_mortimer$ you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance
i trust #sir# that i have not inadvertently just a little said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ chapter the curse of the baskervilles
i have in my pocket a manuscript said $dr_james_mortimer$ i observed it as you entered the #room# said $mr_sherlock_holmes$
it is an old manuscript early eighteenth century unless it is a forgery how can you say that #sir#
you have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the #time# that you have been talking it would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so
you may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject i put that at the exact date is
this #family# paper was committed to my care by #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ whose sudden and tragic #death# some three months ago created so much excitement in devonshire
$dr_james_mortimer$ drew it from his breast pocket i may say that i was his personal #friend# as well as his medical attendant
yet he took this document very seriously and his #mind# was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him
he was a strong minded #man# #sir# shrewd practical and as unimaginative as i am myself $mr_sherlock_holmes$ stretched out his #hand# for the manuscript and flattened it upon his knee
you will observe $dr_watson$ the alternative use of the long and the short it is #one# of several indications which enabled me to fix the date
i looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script at the #head# was written $henry_baskerville$ hall and below in large scrawling figures
it appears to be a statement of some sort yes it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the $henry_baskerville$ #family#
but i understand that it is #something# more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me most modern
a most practical pressing #matter# which must be decided within twenty four hours but the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair
with your permission i will read it to you $mr_sherlock_holmes$ leaned back in his chair placed his finger tips together and closed his #eye# with an air of resignation
$dr_james_mortimer$ turned the manuscript to the #light# and read in a high cracking voice the following curious old world narrative of the origin of the #hound# of the baskervilles there have been many statements yet as i come in a direct line from hugo $henry_baskerville$ and as i had the story from my father who also had it from his i have set it down with all belief that it occurred even as is here set forth
and i would have you believe my sons that the same justice which punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed
learn then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past but rather to be circumspect in the future that those foul passions whereby our #family# has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing
know then that in the #time# of the great rebellion the history of which by the learned lord clarendon i most earnestly commend to your attention this manor of $henry_baskerville$ was held by hugo of that #name# nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild profane and godless #man#
this in truth his neighbours might have pardoned seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his #name# a by #word# through the west
it chanced that this hugo came to love if indeed so dark a passion may be known under so bright a #name# the daughter of a yeoman who held lands near the $henry_baskerville$ estate
but the young maiden being discreet and of good repute would ever avoid him for she feared his evil #name#
so it came to pass that #one# michaelmas this hugo with five or six of his idle and wicked companions stole down upon the farm and carried off the maiden her father and brothers being from home as he well knew
when they had brought her to the hall the maiden was placed in an upper chamber while hugo and his #friend# sat down to a long carouse as was their nightly custom
now the poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below for they say that the #word# used by hugo $henry_baskerville$ when he was in wine were such as might blast the #man# who said them
at last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most active #man# for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered and still covers the south wall she came down from under the eaves and so homeward across the #moor# there being three leagues betwixt the hall and her father farm
it chanced that some little #time# later hugo left his guests to carry food and drink with other worse #thing# perchance to his captive and so found the cage empty and the bird escaped
then as it would seem he became as #one# that hath a devil for rushing down the stairs into the dining hall he sprang upon the great table flagons and trenchers flying before him and he cried aloud before all the company that he would that very #night# render his body and soul to the powers of evil if he might but overtake the wench
and while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the #man# #one# more wicked or it may be more drunken than the rest cried out that they should put the #hound# upon her
whereat hugo ran from the $merripit_house$ crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack and giving the #hound# a kerchief of the maid he swung them to the line and so off full cry in the moonlight over the #moor#
but anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be done upon the moorlands
everything was now in an uproar some calling for their pistols some for their horses and some for another flask of wine
but at length some sense came back to their crazed #mind# and the whole of them thirteen in number took horse and started in pursuit
the moon shone clear above them and they rode swiftly abreast taking that course which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach her own home
now for some space the revellers stood agape unable to understand all that had been done in such haste
they had gone a mile or two when they passed #one# of the #night# shepherds upon the moorlands and they cried to him to know if he had seen the hunt
and the #man# as the story goes was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy maiden with the #hound# upon her track
but i have seen more than that said he for hugo $henry_baskerville$ passed me upon his black mare and there ran mute behind him such a #hound# of hell as god forbid should ever be at my heels
but soon their skins turned cold for there came a galloping across the #moor# and the black mare dabbled with white froth went past with trailing bridle and empty saddle
then the revellers rode close together for a great fear was on them but they still followed over the #moor# though each had he been alone would have been right glad to have turned his horse #head#
so the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward riding slowly in this fashion they came at last upon the #hound#
these though known for their valour and their breed were whimpering in a cluster at the #head# of a deep dip or goyal as we call it upon the #moor# some slinking away and some with starting hackles and staring #eye# gazing down the narrow valley before them
the most of them would by no means advance but three of them the boldest or it may be the most drunken rode forward down the goyal
now it opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great stones still to be seen there which were set by certain forgotten peoples in the #day# of old
the moon was shining bright upon the clearing and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen dead of fear and of fatigue
but it was not the sight of her body nor yet was it that of the body of hugo $henry_baskerville$ lying near her which raised the hair upon the #head# of these three dare devil roysterers but it was that standing over hugo and plucking at his throat there stood a foul #thing# a great black beast shaped like a #hound# yet larger than any #hound# that ever mortal #eye# has rested upon
and even as they looked the #thing# tore the throat out of hugo $henry_baskerville$ on which as it turned its blazing #eye# and dripping jaws upon them the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear #life# still screaming across the #moor#
#one# it is said died that very #night# of what he had seen and the other twain were but broken #man# for the rest of their #day#
such is the tale my sons of the coming of the #hound# which is said to have plagued the #family# so sorely ever since
if i have set it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed
nor can it be denied that many of the #family# have been unhappy in their #death# which have been sudden bloody and mysterious
yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of providence which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in holy writ
to that providence my sons i hereby commend you and i counsel you by #way# of caution to forbear from crossing the #moor# in those dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted
this from hugo $henry_baskerville$ to his sons rodger and john with instructions that they say #nothing# thereof to their sister elizabeth
the company had come to a halt more sober #man# as you may guess than when they started
when $dr_james_mortimer$ had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at $mr_sherlock_holmes$
the latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the fire well said he do you not find it interesting
to a collector of fairy tales $dr_james_mortimer$ drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket now $mr_sherlock_holmes$ we will give you #something# a little more recent
it is a short account of the #fact# elicited at the #death# of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ which occurred a few #day# before that date
this is the devon county chronicle of may th of this year my #friend# leaned a little forward and his expression became intent
our visitor readjusted his glasses and began the recent sudden #death# of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ whose #name# has been mentioned as the probable liberal candidate for mid devon at the next election has cast a gloom over the county
though #sir# $charles_baskerville$ had resided at $henry_baskerville$ hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of character and extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who had been brought into contact with him
in these #day# of nouveaux riches it is refreshing to find a #case# where the scion of an old county #family# which has fallen upon evil #day# is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the fallen grandeur of his line
more wise than those who go on until the wheel turns against them he realized his gains and returned to england with them
#sir# $charles_baskerville$ as is well known made large sums of money in south african speculation it is only two years since he took up his residence at $henry_baskerville$ hall and it is common talk
being himself childless it was his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should within his own lifetime profit by his good fortune and many will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end
how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have been interrupted by his #death# his generous donations to local and county charities have been frequently chronicled in these columns
the circumstances connected with the #death# of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local superstition has given rise
there is no reason whatever to suspect foul play or to imagine that #death# could be from any but natural causes
#sir# $charles_baskerville$ was a widower and a #man# who may be said to have been in some #way# of an eccentric habit of #mind#
in spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes and his indoor servants at $henry_baskerville$ hall consisted of a married couple named $mrs_barrymore$ the husband acting as butler and the #wife# as housekeeper
their evidence corroborated by that of several #friend# tends to show that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ health has for some #time# been impaired and points especially to some affection of the heart manifesting itself in changes of colour breathlessness and acute attacks of nervous depression
$dr_james_mortimer$ the #friend# and medical attendant of the deceased has given evidence to the same effect the #fact# of the #case# are simple
#sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ was in the habit every #night# before going to bed of walking down the famous yew alley of $henry_baskerville$ hall
on the fourth of may #sir# $charles_baskerville$ had declared his intention of starting next #day# for london and had ordered $mrs_barrymore$ to prepare his luggage
that #night# he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar
at twelve clock $mrs_barrymore$ finding the hall #door# still open became alarmed and lighting a lantern went in search of his master
the evidence of the barrymores shows that this had been his custom he never returned the #day# had been wet and #sir# $charles_baskerville$ footmarks were easily traced down the alley
halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the #moor# there were indications that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ had stood for some little #time# here
#one# #fact# which has not been explained is the statement of $mrs_barrymore$ that his master footprints altered their character from the #time# that he passed the #moor# gate and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes
#one# murphy a gipsy horse dealer was on the #moor# at no great distance at the #time# but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink
he then proceeded down the alley and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered he declares that he heard cries but is unable to state from what direction they came
no signs of violence were to be discovered upon #sir# $charles_baskerville$ person and though the doctor evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion so great that $dr_james_mortimer$ refused at first to believe that it was indeed his #friend# and patient who lay before him it was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in #case# of dyspnoea and #death# from cardiac exhaustion
this explanation was borne out by the post mortem examination which showed long standing organic disease and the coroner jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence
it is well that this is so for it is obviously of the utmost importance that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ heir should settle at the hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted
had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair it might have been difficult to find a tenant for $henry_baskerville$ hall
it is understood that the next of kin is mr $henry_baskerville$ if he be still alive the son of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ younger brother
the young #man# when last heard of was in america and inquiries are being instituted with a view to informing him of his good fortune
$dr_james_mortimer$ refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket those are the public #fact# $mr_sherlock_holmes$ in connection with the #death# of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$
i must thank you said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ for calling my attention to a #case# which certainly presents some features of interest
i had observed some newspaper comment at the #time# but i was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the vatican cameos and in my anxiety to oblige the pope
i lost touch with several interesting english #case# this article you say contains all the public #fact# it does then let me have the private #one#
in doing so said $dr_james_mortimer$ who had begun to show signs of some strong emotion i am telling that which i have not confided to anyone
my motive for withholding it from the coroner inquiry is that a #man# of science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition
i had the further motive that $henry_baskerville$ hall as the paper says would certainly remain untenanted if #anything# were done to increase its already rather grim reputation
for both these reasons i thought that i was justified in telling rather less than i knew since no practical good could result from it but with you there is no reason why i should not be perfectly frank
he leaned back put his finger tips together and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression the #moor# is very sparsely inhabited and those who live near each other are thrown very much together
with the exception of $mr_frankland$ of lafter hall and $mr_stapleton$ the naturalist there are no other #man# of education within many miles
#sir# $charles_baskerville$ was a retiring #man# but the chance of his illness brought us together and a community of interests in science kept us so
he had brought back much scientific information from south africa and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the bushman and the hottentot
within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ nervous system was strained to the breaking point
he had taken this legend which i have read you exceedingly to heart so much so that although he would walk in his own grounds #nothing# would induce him to go out upon the #moor# at #night#
incredible as it may appear to you $mr_sherlock_holmes$ he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his #family# and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging
the idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him and on more than #one# occasion he has asked me whether i had on my medical journeys at #night# ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a #hound#
for this reason i saw a good deal of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ the latter question he put to me several #time# and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement
i can well remember driving up to his $merripit_house$ in the evening some three weeks before the fatal event he chanced to be at his hall #door#
i had descended from my gig and was standing in front of him when i saw his #eye# fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror
i whisked round and had just #time# to catch a glimpse of #something# which i took to be a large black calf passing at the #head# of the drive
so excited and alarmed was he that i was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it
i stayed with him all the evening and it was on that occasion to explain the emotion which he had shown that he confided to my keeping that narrative which i read to you when first i came
i mention this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy which followed but i was convinced at the #time# that the #matter# was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no justification
it was gone however and the incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his #mind# it was at my advice that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ was about to go to london
the constant anxiety in which he lived however chimerical the cause of it might be was evidently having a serious effect upon his health
his heart was i knew affected and i thought that a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a new #man#
$mr_stapleton$ a mutual #friend# who was much concerned at his state of health was of the same opinion at the last instant came this terrible catastrophe
on the #night# of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ #death# $mrs_barrymore$ the butler who made the discovery sent perkins the groom on horseback to me and as i was sitting up late i was able to reach $henry_baskerville$ hall within an hour of the event
i followed the footsteps down the yew alley i saw the spot at the #moor# gate where he seemed to have waited i remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point i noted that there were no other footsteps save those of $mrs_barrymore$ on the soft gravel and finally i carefully examined the body which had not been touched until my arrival
#sir# $charles_baskerville$ lay on his #face# his arms out his fingers dug into the ground and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an extent that i could hardly have sworn to his identity
i checked and corroborated all the #fact# which were mentioned at the inquest there was certainly no physical injury of any kind
but #one# false statement was made by $mrs_barrymore$ at the inquest he said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body
he did not observe any but i did some little distance off but fresh and clear footprints footprints a #man# or a #woman#
$dr_james_mortimer$ looked strangely at us for an instant and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ they were the footprints of a gigantic #hound# chapter the problem i confess at these #word# a shudder passed through me
there was a thrill in the doctor voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he told us
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ leaned forward in his excitement and his #eye# had the hard dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly interested
you saw this as clearly as i see you and you said #nothing# what was the use
how was it that no #one# else saw it the marks were some twenty yards from the body and no #one# gave them a thought
i dont suppose i should have done so had i not known this legend there are many sheep dogs on the #moor#
no doubt but this was no sheep dog you say it was large enormous but it had not approached the body
no what sort of #night# was it damp and raw but not actually raining no what is the alley like
there are two lines of old yew hedge twelve feet high and impenetrable the walk in the centre is about eight feet across
is there #anything# between the hedges and the walk yes there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either #side#
i understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at #one# point by a gate yes the wicket gate which leads on to the #moor#
so that to reach the yew alley #one# either has to come down it from the $merripit_house$ or else to enter it by the #moor# gate
is there any other opening none there is an exit through a summer $merripit_house$ at the far end had #sir# $charles_baskerville$ reached this
now tell me $dr_james_mortimer$ and this is important the marks which you saw were on the path and not on the grass
no he lay about fifty yards from it no marks could show on the grass were they on the same #side# of the path as the #moor# gate
yes they were on the edge of the path on the same #side# as the #moor# gate you interest me exceedingly
another point was the wicket gate closed closed and padlocked how high was it about four feet high then anyone could have got over it
yes and what marks did you see by the wicket gate none in particular good heaven did no #one# examine
yes i examined myself and found #nothing# it was all very confused #sir# $charles_baskerville$ had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes
how do you know that because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar excellent this is a colleague $dr_watson$ after our own heart
but the marks he had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel i could discern no others
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ struck his #hand# against his knee with an impatient gesture if i had only been there he cried
that gravel page upon which i might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants
it is evidently a #case# of extraordinary interest and #one# which presented immense opportunities to the scientific expert oh $dr_james_mortimer$ dr $dr_james_mortimer$ to think that you should not have called me in
i could not call you in $mr_sherlock_holmes$ without disclosing these #fact# to the world and i have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so
you have indeed much to answer for besides besides why do you hesitate there is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of detectives is helpless
you mean that the #thing# is supernatural i did not positively say so no but you evidently think it
since the tragedy $mr_sherlock_holmes$ there have come to my ears several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of nature
i find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the #moor# which corresponds with this $henry_baskerville$ demon and which could not possibly be any animal known to science
i have cross examined these #man# #one# of them a hard headed countryman #one# a farrier and #one# a moorland farmer who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition exactly corresponding to the hell #hound# of the legend
i assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district and that it is a hardy #man# who will cross the #moor# at #night#
for example they all agreed that it was a huge creature luminous ghastly and spectral and you a trained #man# of science believe it to be supernatural
i do not know what to believe $mr_sherlock_holmes$ shrugged his shoulders i have hitherto confined my investigations to this world said he
in a modest #way# i have combated evil but to take on the father of evil himself would perhaps be too ambitious a task
yet you must admit that the footmark is material the original #hound# was material enough to tug a #man# throat out and yet he was diabolical as well
i see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists but now $dr_james_mortimer$ tell me this if you hold these views why have you come to consult me at all
you tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investigate #sir# $charles_baskerville$ #death# and that you desire me to do it
i did not say that i desired you to do it then how can i assist you by advising me as to what i should do with #sir# $henry_baskerville$ who arrives at waterloo station dr
on the #death# of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ we inquired for this young gentleman and found that he had been farming in canada
$dr_james_mortimer$ looked at his watch in exactly #one# hour and a quarter he being the heir yes from the accounts which have reached us
he is an excellent fellow in every #way# i speak now not as a medical #man# but as a trustee and executor of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ will
the only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was rodger $henry_baskerville$ the youngest of three brothers of whom poor #sir# $charles_baskerville$ was the elder
there is no other claimant i presume none the second brother who died young is the father of this lad $henry_baskerville$
he came of the old masterful $henry_baskerville$ strain and was the very image they tell me of the #family# picture of old hugo
the third rodger was the black sheep of the #family# he made england too hot to hold him fled to central america and died there in of yellow fever
$henry_baskerville$ is the last of the baskervilles in #one# hour and five minutes i meet him at waterloo station i have had a wire that he arrived at southampton this #morning#
now $mr_sherlock_holmes$ what would you advise me to do with him why should he not go to the home of his fathers
i feel sure that if #sir# $charles_baskerville$ could have spoken with me before his #death# he would have warned me against bringing this the last of the old race and the heir to great wealth to that deadly #place#
it seems natural does it not and yet consider that every $henry_baskerville$ who goes there meets with an evil fate and yet it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor bleak countryside depends upon his presence
all the good work which has been done by #sir# $charles_baskerville$ will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the hall
i fear lest i should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the #matter# and that is why i bring the #case# before you and ask for your advice
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ considered for a little #time# put into plain #word# the #matter# is this said he in your opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes dartmoor an unsafe abode for a $henry_baskerville$ that is your opinion
but surely if your supernatural theory be correct it could work the young #man# evil in london as easily as in devonshire
at least i might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that this may be so exactly a devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a #thing#
you put the #matter# more flippantly $mr_sherlock_holmes$ than you would probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these #thing#
your advice then as i understand it is that the young #man# will be as safe in devonshire as in london
i recommend #sir# that you take a cab call off your spaniel who is scratching at my front #door# and proceed to waterloo to meet #sir# $henry_baskerville$
he comes in fifty minutes what would you recommend and then and then you will say #nothing# to him at all until i have made up my #mind# about the #matter#
at ten clock tomorrow $dr_james_mortimer$ i will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here and it will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring #sir# $henry_baskerville$ with you
how long will it take you to make up your #mind# twenty four hours i will do so $mr_sherlock_holmes$
he scribbled the appointment on his shirt cuff and hurried off in his strange peering absent minded fashion $mr_sherlock_holmes$ stopped him at the #head# of the stair
only #one# more question $dr_james_mortimer$ you say that before #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ #death# several people saw this apparition upon the #moor#
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him
three people did did any see it after i have not heard of any thank you good #morning#
going out $dr_watson$ unless i can help you no my dear fellow it is at the hour of action that i turn to you for aid
but this is splendid really unique from some points of view when you pass bradley would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco
then i should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this #morning#
i knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my #friend# in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence constructed alternative theories balanced #one# against the other and made up his #mind# as to which points were essential and which immaterial
thank you it would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening i therefore spent the #day# at my club and did not return to baker street until evening
my first impression as i opened the #door# was that a fire had broken out for the #room# was so filled with smoke that the #light# of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it
as i entered however my fears were set at rest for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me coughing
through the haze i had a vague vision of $mr_sherlock_holmes$ in his dressing gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips
it was nearly nine clock when i found myself in the sitting #room# once more several rolls of paper lay around him
caught cold $dr_watson$ said he no it this poisonous atmosphere i suppose it is pretty thick now that you mention it
thick it is intolerable open the #window# then you have been at your club all #day# i perceive my dear $mr_sherlock_holmes$
there is a delightful freshness about you $dr_watson$ which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which i possess at your expense
am i right certainly but how he laughed at my bewildered expression a gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry #day#
he returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boots he has been a fixture therefore all #day#
he is not a #man# with intimate #friend# where then could he have been is it not obvious well it is rather obvious
the world is full of obvious #thing# which nobody by any chance ever observes where do you think that i have been
my body has remained in this armchair and has i regret to observe consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco
after you left i sent down to stamford for the ordnance map of this portion of the #moor# and my spirit has hovered over it all #day#
a fixture also on the contrary i have been to devonshire in spirit exactly i flatter myself that i could find my #way# about
a large scale map i presume very large he unrolled #one# section and held it over his knee here you have the particular district which concerns us
i fancy the yew alley though not marked under that #name# must stretch along this line with the #moor# as you perceive upon the right of it
that is $henry_baskerville$ hall in the middle with a wood round it exactly this small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of grimpen where our #friend# $dr_james_mortimer$ has his headquarters
within a radius of five miles there are as you see only a very few scattered dwellings here is lafter hall which was mentioned in the narrative
there is a $merripit_house$ indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist $mr_stapleton$ if i remember right was his #name#
here are two moorland farmhouses high tor and foulmire then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of princetown between and around these scattered points extends the desolate lifeless #moor#
this then is the stage upon which tragedy has been played and upon which we may help to play it again
it must be a wild #place# yes the setting is a worthy #one# if the devil did desire to have a #hand# in the affairs of #man#
then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation the devil agents may be of flesh and blood may they not
the #one# is whether any crime has been committed at all the second is what is the crime and how was it committed
of course if $dr_james_mortimer$ surmise should be correct and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of nature there is an end of our investigation
there are two questions waiting for us at the outset but we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this #one#
i think we ll shut that #window# again if you dont #mind# it is a singular #thing# but i find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought
i have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think but that is the logical outcome of my convictions
have you turned the #case# over in your #mind# yes i have thought a good deal of it in the course of the #day#
what do you make of it it is very bewildering it has certainly a character of its own
there are points of distinction about it that change in the footprints for example what do you make of that $dr_james_mortimer$ said that the #man# had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the alley
he only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest why should a #man# walk on tiptoe down the alley
what then he was running $dr_watson$ running desperately running for his #life# running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his #face#
running from what there lies our problem there are indications that the #man# was crazed with fear before ever he began to run
how can you say that i am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the #moor#
if that were so and it seems most probable only a #man# who had lost his wits would have run from the $merripit_house$ instead of towards it
if the gipsy evidence may be taken as true he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be
then again whom was he waiting for that #night# and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own $merripit_house$
you think that he was waiting for someone the #man# was elderly and infirm we can understand his taking an evening stroll but the ground was damp and the #night# inclement
is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes as $dr_james_mortimer$ with more practical sense than i should have given him credit for deduced from the cigar ash
but he went out every evening i think it unlikely that he waited at the #moor# gate every evening on the contrary the evidence is that he avoided the #moor#
that #night# he waited there it was the #night# before he made his departure for london the #thing# takes shape $dr_watson$
might i ask you to #hand# me my violin and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting $dr_james_mortimer$ and #sir# $henry_baskerville$ in the #morning#
it becomes coherent chapter #sir# $henry_baskerville$ our breakfast table was cleared early and $mr_sherlock_holmes$ waited in his dressing gown for the promised interview
our clients were punctual to their appointment for the clock had just struck ten when $dr_james_mortimer$ was shown up followed by the young #baronet#
the latter was a small alert dark eyed #man# about thirty years of age very sturdily built with thick black eyebrows and a strong pugnacious #face#
he wore a ruddy tinted tweed suit and had the weather beaten appearance of #one# who has spent most of his #time# in the open air and yet there was #something# in his steady #eye# and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman
why yes said he and the strange #thing# is $mr_sherlock_holmes$ that if my #friend# here had not proposed coming round to you this #morning# i should have come on my own account
i understand that you think out little puzzles and i ve had #one# this #morning# which wants more thinking out than i am able to give it
this is #sir# $henry_baskerville$ said $dr_james_mortimer$ pray take a seat #sir# $henry_baskerville$ do i understand you to say that you have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in london
#nothing# of much importance $mr_sherlock_holmes$ only a joke as like as not it was this #letter# if you can call it a #letter# which reached me this #morning#
he laid an envelope upon the table and we all bent over it it was of common quality grayish in colour
the address #sir# $henry_baskerville$ northumberland hotel was printed in rough characters the post mark charing cross and the date of posting the preceding evening
who knew that you were going to the northumberland hotel asked $mr_sherlock_holmes$ glancing keenly across at our visitor no #one# could have known
we only decided after i met $dr_james_mortimer$ but $dr_james_mortimer$ was no doubt already stopping there no i had been staying with a #friend# said the doctor
there was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel hum someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements
out of the envelope he took a half sheet of foolscap paper folded into four this he opened and spread flat upon the table
across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed #word# upon it it ran as you value your #life# or your reason keep away from the #moor#
now said #sir# $henry_baskerville$ perhaps you will tell me $mr_sherlock_holmes$ what in thunder is the meaning of that and who it is that takes so much interest in my affairs
the #word# #moor# only was printed in ink what do you make of it $dr_james_mortimer$ you must allow that there is #nothing# supernatural about this at any rate
no #sir# but it might very well come from someone who was convinced that the business is supernatural what business asked #sir# $henry_baskerville$ sharply
it seems to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about my own affairs
we will confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this very interesting document which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening
you shall share our knowledge before you leave this #room# #sir# $henry_baskerville$ i promise you that said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ have you yesterday #time# $dr_watson$
it is here in the corner might i trouble you for it the inside page please with the leading articles
he glanced swiftly over it running his #eye# up and down the columns capital article this on free trade permit me to give you an extract from it
you may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff but it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the country diminish the value of our imports and lower the general conditions of #life# in this island
what do you think of that $dr_watson$ cried $mr_sherlock_holmes$ in high glee rubbing his #hand# together with satisfaction
$dr_james_mortimer$ looked at $mr_sherlock_holmes$ with an air of professional interest and #sir# $henry_baskerville$ turned a pair of puzzled dark #eye# upon me
i dont know much about the tariff and #thing# of that kind said he but it seems to me we ve got a bit off the trail so far as that note is concerned
dont you think that is an admirable sentiment on the contrary i think we are particularly hot upon the trail #sir# $henry_baskerville$
$dr_watson$ here knows more about my methods than you do but i fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence
and yet my dear $dr_watson$ there is so very close a connection that the #one# is extracted out of the other
no i confess that i see no connection you your your #life# reason value keep away from the dont you see now whence these #word# have been taken
if any possible doubt remained it is settled by the #fact# that keep away and from the are cut out in #one# piece
by thunder you re right well if that isnt smart cried #sir# $henry_baskerville$ well now so it is really $mr_sherlock_holmes$ this exceeds #anything# which i could have imagined said $dr_james_mortimer$ gazing at my #friend# in amazement
i could understand anyone saying that the #word# were from a newspaper but that you should #name# which and add that it came from the leading article is really #one# of the most remarkable #thing# which i have ever known
how did you do it i presume doctor that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an esquimau
most certainly but how because that is my special hobby the differences are obvious the supra orbital crest the facial angle the maxillary curve the
there is as much difference to my #eye# between the leaded bourgeois type of a #time# article and the slovenly print of an evening half penny paper as there could be between your negro and your esquimau
the detection of types is #one# of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime though i confess that once when i was very young
but this is my special hobby and the differences are equally obvious i confused the leeds mercury with the western #morning# news
but a #time# leader is entirely distinctive and these #word# could have been taken from #nothing# else as it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the #word# in yesterday issue
so far as i can follow you then $mr_sherlock_holmes$ said #sir# $henry_baskerville$ someone cut out this message with a scissors nail scissors said $mr_sherlock_holmes$
you can see that it was a very short bladed scissors since the cutter had to take two snips over keep away
that is so someone then cut out the message with a pair of short bladed scissors pasted it with paste gum said $mr_sherlock_holmes$
with gum on to the paper but i want to know why the #word# #moor# should have been written because he could not find it in print
the other #word# were all simple and might be found in any issue but #moor# would be less common why of course that would explain it
have you read #anything# else in this message $mr_sherlock_holmes$ there are #one# or two indications and yet the utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues
the address you observe is printed in rough characters but the #time# is a paper which is seldom found in any #hand# but those of the highly educated
we may take it therefore that the #letter# was composed by an educated #man# who wished to pose as an uneducated #one# and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known or come to be known by you
again you will observe that the #word# are not gummed on in an accurate line but that some are much higher than others
#life# for example is quite out of its proper #place# that may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter
on the whole i incline to the latter view since the #matter# was evidently important and it is unlikely that the composer of such a #letter# would be careless
if he were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be in a hurry since any #letter# posted up to early #morning# would reach #sir# $henry_baskerville$ before he would leave his hotel
did the composer fear an interruption and from whom we are coming now rather into the region of guesswork said $dr_james_mortimer$
it is the scientific use of the imagination but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculation
now you would call it a guess no doubt but i am almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel
say rather into the region where we balance probabilities and choose the most likely how in the world can you say that
the pen has spluttered twice in a single #word# and has run dry three #time# in a short address showing that there was very little ink in the bottle
now a private pen or ink bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state and the combination of the two must be quite rare
if you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have given the writer trouble but you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen where it is rare to get #anything# else
yes i have very little hesitation in saying that could we examine the waste paper baskets of the hotels around charing cross until we found the remains of the mutilated #time# leader we could lay our #hand# straight upon the person who sent this singular message
he was carefully examining the foolscap upon which the #word# were pasted holding it only an inch or two from his #eye#
halloa halloa what this well #nothing# said he throwing it down it is a blank half sheet of paper without even a water mark upon it
i think we have drawn as much as we can from this curious #letter# and now #sir# $henry_baskerville$ has #anything# else of interest happened to you since you have been in london
why no $mr_sherlock_holmes$ i think not you have not observed anyone follow or watch you i seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel said our visitor
why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me we are coming to that you have #nothing# else to report to us before we go into this #matter#
well it depends upon what you think worth reporting i think #anything# out of the ordinary routine of #life# well worth reporting
i dont know much of british #life# yet for i have spent nearly all my #time# in the states and in canada
but i hope that to lose #one# of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of #life# over here
#sir# $henry_baskerville$ smiled you have lost #one# of your boots my dear #sir# cried $dr_james_mortimer$ it is only mislaid
you will find it when you return to the hotel what is the use of troubling $mr_sherlock_holmes$ with trifles of this kind
well he asked me for #anything# outside the ordinary routine exactly said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ however foolish the incident may seem you have lost #one# of your boots you say
well mislaid it anyhow i put them both outside my #door# last #night# and there was only #one# in the #morning#
the worst of it is that i only bought the pair last #night# in the strand and i have never had them on
i could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them if you have never worn them why did you put them out to be cleaned
then i understand that on your arrival in london yesterday you went out at once and bought a pair of boots
they were tan boots and had never been varnished that was why i put them out i did a good deal of shopping
you see if i am to be squire down there i must dress the part and it may be that i have got a little careless in my #way# out west
among other #thing# i bought these brown boots gave six dollars for them and had #one# stolen before ever i had them on my feet
$dr_james_mortimer$ here went round with me it seems a singularly useless #thing# to steal said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ i confess that i share $dr_james_mortimer$ belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found
and now gentlemen said the #baronet# with decision it seems to me that i have spoken quite enough about the little that i know
it is #time# that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all driving at
your request is a very reasonable #one# $mr_sherlock_holmes$ answered $dr_james_mortimer$ i think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it to us
thus encouraged our scientific #friend# drew his papers from his pocket and presented the whole #case# as he had done upon the #morning# before
#sir# $henry_baskerville$ listened with the deepest attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise well i seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance said he when the long narrative was finished
of course i ve heard of the #hound# ever since i was in the nursery it the pet story of the #family# though i never thought of taking it seriously before
but as to my uncle #death# well it all seems boiling up in my #head# and i cant get it clear yet
you dont seem quite to have made up your #mind# whether it a #case# for a policeman or a clergyman precisely
and now there this affair of the #letter# to me at the hotel i suppose that fits into its #place#
it seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on upon the #moor# said $dr_james_mortimer$
and also said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ that someone is not ill disposed towards you since they warn you of danger
or it may be that they wish for their own purposes to scare me away well of course that is possible also
but the practical point which we now have to decide #sir# $henry_baskerville$ is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to $henry_baskerville$ hall
i am very much indebted to you $dr_james_mortimer$ for introducing me to a problem which presents several interesting alternatives
why should i not go there seems to be danger do you mean danger from this #family# fiend or do you mean danger from human beings
there is no devil in hell $mr_sherlock_holmes$ and there is no #man# upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people and you may take that to be my final answer
well that is what we have to find out whichever it is my answer is fixed his dark brows knitted and his #face# flushed to a dusky red as he spoke
it was evident that the fiery temper of the baskervilles was not extinct in this their last representative meanwhile said he i have hardly had #time# to think over all that you have told me
it a big #thing# for a #man# to have to understand and to decide at #one# sitting i should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my #mind#
now look here $mr_sherlock_holmes$ it half past eleven now and i am going back right away to my hotel suppose you and your #friend# $dr_watson$ come round and lunch with us at two
i ll be able to tell you more clearly then how this #thing# strikes me is that convenient to you $dr_watson$ perfectly
then you may expect us shall i have a cab called i prefer to walk for this affair has flurried me rather
i ll join you in a walk with pleasure said his companion then we meet again at two clock au revoir and good #morning#
we heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front #door# in an instant $mr_sherlock_holmes$ had changed from the languid dreamer to the #man# of action
your hat and boots $dr_watson$ quick not a moment to lose he rushed into his #room# in his dressing gown and was back again in a few seconds in a frock coat
we hurried together down the stairs and into the street $dr_james_mortimer$ and $henry_baskerville$ were still visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of oxford street
shall i run on and stop them not for the world my dear $dr_watson$ i am perfectly satisfied with your company if you will tolerate mine
our #friend# are wise for it is certainly a very fine #morning# for a walk he quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us by about half
then still keeping a hundred yards behind we followed into oxford street and so down regent street once our #friend# stopped and stared into a shop #window# upon which $mr_sherlock_holmes$ did the same
an instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction and following the direction of his eager #eye# i saw that a hansom cab with a #man# inside which had halted on the other #side# of the street was now proceeding slowly onward again
there our #man# $dr_watson$ come along we ll have a good look at him if we can do no more
at that instant i was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing #eye# turned upon us through the #side# #window# of the cab
instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up #something# was screamed to the driver and the cab flew madly off down regent street
then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic but the start was too great and already the cab was out of sight
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ looked eagerly round for another but no empty #one# was in sight there now said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ bitterly as he emerged panting and white with vexation from the tide of vehicles
was ever such bad luck and such bad management too $dr_watson$ watson if you are an honest #man# you will record this also and set it against my successes
well it was evident from what we have heard that $henry_baskerville$ has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town
who was the #man# i have not an idea a spy how else could it be known so quickly that it was the northumberland hotel which he had chosen
if they had followed him the first #day# i argued that they would follow him also the second you may have observed that i twice strolled over to the #window# while $dr_james_mortimer$ was reading his legend
yes i remember i was looking out for loiterers in the street but i saw none we are dealing with a clever #man# $dr_watson$
this #matter# cuts very deep and though i have not finally made up my #mind# whether it is a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us i am conscious always of power and design
so wily was he that he had not trusted himself upon foot but he had availed himself of a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice
his method had the additional advantage that if they were to take a cab he was all ready to follow them
when our #friend# left i at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their invisible attendant it has however #one# obvious disadvantage
it puts him in the power of the cabman exactly what a pity we did not get the number
my dear $dr_watson$ clumsy as i have been you surely do not seriously imagine that i neglected to get the number
no is our #man# but that is no use to us for the moment i fail to see how you could have done more
i should then at my leisure have hired a second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance or better still have driven to the northumberland hotel and waited there
when our unknown had followed $henry_baskerville$ home we should have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for
as it is by an indiscreet eagerness which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent we have betrayed ourselves and lost our #man#
we had been sauntering slowly down regent street during this conversation and $dr_james_mortimer$ with his companion had long vanished in front of us
on observing the cab i should have instantly turned and walked in the other direction there is no object in our following them said $mr_sherlock_holmes$
the shadow has departed and will not return we must see what further cards we have in our #hand# and play them with decision
could you swear to that #man# #face# within the cab i could swear only to the beard and so could i from which i gather that in all probability it was a false #one#
a clever #man# upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard save to conceal his features come in here $dr_watson$
ah wilson i see you have not forgotten the little #case# in which i had the good fortune to help you
he turned into #one# of the district messenger offices where he was warmly greeted by the manager no #sir# indeed i have not
i have some recollection wilson that you had among your boys a lad named cartwright who showed some ability during the investigation
you saved my good #name# and perhaps my #life# my dear fellow you exaggerate yes #sir# he is still with us
could you ring him up thank you and i should be glad to have change of this five pound note a lad of fourteen with a bright keen #face# had obeyed the summons of the manager
he stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous detective let me have the hotel directory said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ thank you
now cartwright there are the #name# of twenty three hotels here all in the immediate neighbourhood of charing cross do you see
yes #sir# you will visit each of these in turn yes #sir# you will begin in each #case# by giving the outside porter #one# shilling
here are twenty three shillings yes #sir# you will tell him that you want to see the waste paper of yesterday
you will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are looking for it you understand yes #sir#
but what you are really looking for is the centre page of the #time# with some holes cut in it with scissors
here is a copy of the #time# it is this page you could easily recognize it could you not
yes #sir# in each #case# the outside porter will send for the hall porter to whom also you will give a shilling
you will then learn in possibly twenty #case# out of the twenty three that the waste of the #day# before has been burned or removed
in the three other #case# you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page of the #time# among it
here are twenty three shillings the odds are enormously against your finding it there are ten shillings over in #case# of emergencies
and now $dr_watson$ it only remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman no and then we will drop into #one# of the bond street picture galleries and fill in the #time# until we are due at the hotel
let me have a report by wire at baker street before evening chapter three broken threads $mr_sherlock_holmes$ had in a very remarkable degree the power of detaching his #mind# at will
for two hours the strange business in which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten and he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern belgian masters
he would talk of #nothing# but art of which he had the crudest ideas from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at the northumberland hotel
#sir# $henry_baskerville$ is upstairs expecting you said the clerk he asked me to show you up at once when you came
have you any objection to my looking at your register said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ not in the least the book showed that two #name# had been added after that of $henry_baskerville$
#one# was theophilus johnson and #family# of newcastle the other mrs oldmore and maid of high lodge alton surely that must be the same johnson whom i used to know said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ to the porter
a lawyer is he not gray headed and walks with a limp no #sir# this is mr johnson the coal owner a very active gentleman not older than yourself
surely you are mistaken about his trade no #sir# he has used this hotel for many years and he is very well known to us
ah that settles it mrs oldmore too i seem to remember the #name# excuse my curiosity but often in calling upon #one# #friend# #one# finds another
she is an invalid #lady# #sir# her husband was once mayor of gloucester she always comes to us when she is in town
we have established a most important #fact# by these questions $dr_watson$ he continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together
we know now that the people who are so interested in our #friend# have not settled down in his own hotel
that means that while they are as we have seen very anxious to watch him they are equally anxious that he should not see them
thank you i am afraid i cannot claim her acquaintance now this is a most suggestive #fact# what does it suggest
it suggests halloa my dear fellow what on earth is the #matter# as we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against #sir# $henry_baskerville$ himself
so furious was he that he was hardly articulate and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more western dialect than any which we had heard from him in the #morning#
his #face# was flushed with anger and he held an old and dusty boot in #one# of his #hand# seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel he cried
they ll find they ve started in to monkey with the wrong #man# unless they are careful by thunder if that chap cant find my missing boot there will be trouble
i can take a joke with the best $mr_sherlock_holmes$ but they ve got a bit over the mark this #time# still looking for your boot
yes #sir# and mean to find it but surely you said that it was a new brown boot
so it was #sir# and now it an old black #one# what you dont mean to say that just what i do mean to say
i only had three pairs in the world the new brown the old black and the patent leathers which i am wearing
last #night# they took #one# of my brown #one# and today they have sneaked #one# of the black well have you got it
speak out #man# and dont stand staring an agitated german waiter had appeared upon the scene no #sir# i have made inquiry all over the hotel but i can hear no #word# of it
well either that boot comes back before sundown or i ll see the manager and tell him that i go right straight out of this hotel
it shall be found #sir# i promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be found
#mind# it is for it the last #thing# of mine that i ll lose in this den of thieves well well $mr_sherlock_holmes$ you ll excuse my troubling you about such a trifle
i think it well worth troubling about why you look very serious over it how do you explain it
i just dont attempt to explain it it seems the very maddest queerest #thing# that ever happened to me the queerest perhaps said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ thoughtfully
what do you make of it yourself well i dont profess to understand it yet this #case# of yours is very complex #sir# $henry_baskerville$
when taken in conjunction with your uncle #death# i am not sure that of all the five hundred #case# of capital importance which i have handled there is #one# which cuts so deep
but we hold several threads in our #hand# and the odds are that #one# or other of them guides us to the truth
we may waste #time# in following the wrong #one# but sooner or later we must come upon the right we had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business which had brought us together
it was in the private sitting #room# to which we afterwards repaired that $mr_sherlock_holmes$ asked $henry_baskerville$ what were his intentions to go to $henry_baskerville$ hall
and when at the end of the week on the whole said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ i think that your decision is a wise #one#
i have ample evidence that you are being dogged in london and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people are or what their object can be
if their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief and we should be powerless to prevent it you did not know $dr_james_mortimer$ that you were followed this #morning# from my $merripit_house$
$dr_james_mortimer$ started violently followed by whom that unfortunately is what i cannot tell you have you among your neighbours or acquaintances on dartmoor any #man# with a black full beard
no or let me see why yes $mrs_barrymore$ #sir# $charles_baskerville$ butler is a #man# with a full black beard ha
where is $mrs_barrymore$ he is in charge of the hall we had best ascertain if he is really there or if by any possibility he might be in london
how can you do that give me a telegraph form is all ready for #sir# $henry_baskerville$ that will do
very good we will send a second wire to the postmaster grimpen telegram to mr $mrs_barrymore$ to be delivered into his own #hand#
address to mr $mrs_barrymore$ $henry_baskerville$ hall what is the nearest telegraph office grimpen if absent please return wire to #sir# $henry_baskerville$ northumberland hotel
that should let us know before evening whether $mrs_barrymore$ is at his post in devonshire or not that so said $henry_baskerville$
by the #way# $dr_james_mortimer$ who is this $mrs_barrymore$ anyhow he is the son of the old caretaker who is dead
they have looked after the hall for four generations now so far as i know he and his #wife# are as respectable a couple as any in the county
at the same #time# said $henry_baskerville$ it clear enough that so long as there are none of the #family# at the hall these people have a mighty fine home and #nothing# to do
that is true did $mrs_barrymore$ profit at all by #sir# $charles_baskerville$ will asked $mr_sherlock_holmes$ he and his #wife# had five hundred pounds each
ha did they know that they would receive this yes #sir# $charles_baskerville$ was very fond of talking about the provisions of his will
i hope said $dr_james_mortimer$ that you do not look with suspicious #eye# upon everyone who received a legacy from #sir# $charles_baskerville$ for i also had a thousand pounds left to me
that is very interesting indeed and anyone else there were many insignificant sums to individuals and a large number of public charities
the residue all went to #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and how much was the residue seven hundred and forty thousand pounds
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ raised his eyebrows in surprise i had no idea that so gigantic a sum was involved said he
#sir# $charles_baskerville$ had the reputation of being rich but we did not know how very rich he was until we came to examine his securities
the total value of the estate was close on to a million dear me it is a stake for which a #man# might well play a desperate game
and #one# more question $dr_james_mortimer$ supposing that #anything# happened to our young #friend# here you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis who would inherit the estate
since rodger $henry_baskerville$ #sir# $charles_baskerville$ younger brother died unmarried the estate would descend to the desmonds who are distant cousins $dr_james_mortimer$ desmond is an elderly clergyman in westmoreland
thank you these details are all of great interest have you met mr $dr_james_mortimer$ desmond yes he once came down to visit #sir# $charles_baskerville$
he is a #man# of venerable appearance and of saintly #life# i remember that he refused to accept any settlement from #sir# $charles_baskerville$ though he pressed it upon him
and this #man# of simple tastes would be the heir to #sir# $charles_baskerville$ thousands he would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed
he would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the present owner who can of course do what he likes with it
and have you made your will #sir# $henry_baskerville$ no $mr_sherlock_holmes$ i have not i ve had no #time# for it was only yesterday that i learned how #matter# stood
but in any #case# i feel that the money should go with the title and estate that was my poor uncle idea
how is the owner going to restore the glories of the baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up the property
well #sir# $henry_baskerville$ i am of #one# #mind# with you as to the advisability of your going down to devonshire without delay
$merripit_house$ land and dollars must go together quite so there is only #one# provision which i must make you certainly must not go alone
$dr_james_mortimer$ returns with me but $dr_james_mortimer$ has his practice to attend to and his $merripit_house$ is miles away from yours
with all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to help you no #sir# $henry_baskerville$ you must take with you someone a trusty #man# who will be always by your #side#
if #matter# came to a crisis i should endeavour to be present in person but you can understand that with my extensive consulting practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters it is impossible for me to be absent from london for an indefinite #time#
at the present instant #one# of the most revered #name# in england is being besmirched by a blackmailer and only i can stop a disastrous scandal
is it possible that you could come yourself $mr_sherlock_holmes$ you will see how impossible it is for me to go to dartmoor
if my #friend# would undertake it there is no #man# who is better worth having at your #side# when you are in a tight #place#
whom would you recommend then $mr_sherlock_holmes$ laid his #hand# upon my arm no #one# can say so more confidently than i
the proposition took me completely by surprise but before i had #time# to answer $henry_baskerville$ seized me by the #hand# and wrung it heartily
well now that is real kind of you $dr_watson$ said he you see how it is with me and you know just as much about the #matter# as i do
the promise of adventure had always a fascination for me and i was complimented by the #word# of $mr_sherlock_holmes$ and by the eagerness with which the #baronet# hailed me as a companion
if you will come down to $henry_baskerville$ hall and see me through i ll never forget it i will come with pleasure said i
i do not know how i could employ my #time# better and you will report very carefully to me said $mr_sherlock_holmes$
when a crisis comes as it will do i will direct how you shall act i suppose that by saturday all might be ready
would that suit $dr_watson$ perfectly then on saturday unless you hear to the contrary we shall meet at the ten thirty train from paddington
we had risen to depart when $henry_baskerville$ gave a cry of triumph and diving into #one# of the corners of the #room# he drew a brown boot from under a cabinet
my missing boot he cried may all our difficulties vanish as easily said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ but it is a very singular #thing# $dr_james_mortimer$ remarked
i searched this #room# carefully before lunch and so did i said $henry_baskerville$ every inch of it
there was certainly no boot in it then in that #case# the waiter must have placed it there while we were lunching
the german was sent for but professed to know #nothing# of the #matter# nor could any inquiry clear it up
another item had been added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly
setting aside the whole grim story of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ #death# we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two #day# which included the receipt of the printed #letter# the black bearded spy in the hansom the loss of the new brown boot the loss of the old black boot and now the return of the new brown boot
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to baker street and i knew from his drawn brows and keen #face# that his #mind# like my own was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted
all afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and thought just before dinner two telegrams were handed in
the first ran have just heard that $mrs_barrymore$ is at the hall $henry_baskerville$ the second visited twenty three hotels as directed but sorry to report unable to trace cut sheet of #time#
cartwright there go two of my threads $dr_watson$ there is #nothing# more stimulating than a #case# where everything goes against you
we must cast round for another scent we have still the cabman who drove the spy exactly i have wired to get his #name# and address from the official registry
the ring at the bell proved to be #something# even more satisfactory than an answer however for the #door# opened and a rough looking fellow entered who was evidently the #man# himself
i got a message from the #head# office that a gent at this address had been inquiring for no said he
i should not be surprised if this were an answer to my question i ve driven my cab this seven years and never a #word# of complaint
i came here straight from the yard to ask you to your #face# what you had against me i have #nothing# in the world against you my good #man# said $mr_sherlock_holmes$
on the contrary i have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my questions
well i ve had a good #day# and no mistake said the cabman with a grin what was it you wanted to ask #sir#
first of all your #name# and address in #case# i want you again john clayton turpey street the borough
now clayton tell me all about the fare who came and watched this $merripit_house$ at ten clock this #morning# and afterwards followed the two gentlemen down regent street
my cab is out of shipley yard near waterloo station $mr_sherlock_holmes$ made a note of it the #man# looked surprised and a little embarrassed
why there no good my telling you #thing# for you seem to know as much as i do already said he
the truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a detective and that i was to say #nothing# about him to anyone
my good fellow this is a very serious business and you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide #anything# from me
you say that your fare told you that he was a detective yes he did when did he say this
when he left me did he say #anything# more he mentioned his #name# $mr_sherlock_holmes$ cast a swift glance of triumph at me
oh he mentioned his #name# did he that was imprudent what was the #name# that he mentioned his #name# said the cabman was $mr_sherlock_holmes$
never have i seen my #friend# more completely taken aback than by the cabman reply for an instant he sat in silent amazement
then he burst into a hearty laugh a touch $dr_watson$ an undeniable touch said he i feel a foil as quick and supple as my own
he got home upon me very prettily that #time# so his #name# was $mr_sherlock_holmes$ was it yes #sir# that was the gentleman #name#
excellent tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred he hailed me at half past nine in trafalgar square
he said that he was a detective and he offered me two guineas if i would do exactly what he wanted all #day# and ask no questions
first we drove down to the northumberland hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank
i was glad enough to agree we followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here this very #door# said $mr_sherlock_holmes$
well i couldnt be sure of that but i dare say my fare knew all about it we pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half
then the two gentlemen passed us walking and we followed down baker street and along i know said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ until we got three quarters down regent street
then my gentleman threw up the trap and he cried that i should drive right away to waterloo station as hard as i could go
i whipped up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes then he paid up his two guineas like a good #one# and away he went into the station
only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said it might interest you to know that you have been driving $mr_sherlock_holmes$
that how i come to know the #name# i see and you saw no more of him not after he went into the station
and how would you describe $mr_sherlock_holmes$ the cabman scratched his #head# well he wasnt altogether such an easy gentleman to describe
i put him at forty years of age and he was of a middle height two or three inches shorter than you #sir#
he was dressed like a toff and he had a black beard cut square at the end and a pale #face#
i dont know as i could say more than that colour of his #eye# no i cant say that
#nothing# more that you can remember no #sir# #nothing# well then here is your half sovereign there another #one# waiting for you if you can bring any more information
good #night# good #night# #sir# and thank you john clayton departed chuckling and $mr_sherlock_holmes$ turned to me with a shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile
he knew our number knew that #sir# $henry_baskerville$ had consulted me spotted who i was in regent street conjectured that i had got the number of the cab and would lay my #hand# on the driver and so sent back this audacious message
snap goes our third thread and we end where we began said he the cunning rascal i tell you $dr_watson$ this #time# we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel
i ve been checkmated in london i can only wish you better luck in devonshire but i not easy in my #mind# about it
about what about sending you it an ugly business $dr_watson$ an ugly dangerous business and the more i see of it the less
yes my dear fellow you may laugh but i give you my #word# that i shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in baker street once more
$henry_baskerville$ hall #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and $dr_james_mortimer$ were ready upon the appointed #day# and we started as arranged for devonshire
i like it chapter $mr_sherlock_holmes$ drove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions and advice
i will not bias your #mind# by suggesting theories or suspicions $dr_watson$ said he i wish you simply to report #fact# in the fullest possible manner to me and you can leave me to do the theorizing
#anything# which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the #case# and especially the relations between young $henry_baskerville$ and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the #death# of #sir# $charles_baskerville$
what sort of #fact# i asked i have made some inquiries myself in the last few #day# but the results have i fear been negative
#one# #thing# only appears to be certain and that is that mr $dr_james_mortimer$ desmond who is the next heir is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable disposition so that this persecution does not arise from him
i really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our calculations there remain the people who will actually surround #sir# $henry_baskerville$ upon the #moor#
would it not be well in the first #place# to get rid of this $mrs_barrymore$ couple by no means
if they are innocent it would be a cruel injustice and if they are guilty we should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them
you could not make a greater mistake no no we will preserve them upon our list of suspects then there is a groom at the hall if i remember right
there is our #friend# $dr_james_mortimer$ whom i believe to be entirely honest and there is his #wife# of whom we know #nothing#
there are two moorland farmers there is this naturalist $mr_stapleton$ and there is his sister who is said to be a young #lady# of attractions
there is $mr_frankland$ of lafter hall who is also an unknown factor and there are #one# or two other neighbours
these are the folk who must be your very special study i will do my best you have arms i suppose
yes i thought it as well to take them most certainly keep your revolver near you #night# and #day# and never relax your precautions
our #friend# had already secured a first class carriage and were waiting for us upon the platform no we have no news of any kind said $dr_james_mortimer$ in answer to my #friend# questions
i can swear to #one# #thing# and that is that we have not been shadowed during the last two #day#
we have never gone out without keeping a sharp watch and no #one# could have escaped our notice you have always kept together i presume
i usually give up #one# #day# to pure amusement when i come to town so i spent it at the museum of the college of surgeons
except yesterday afternoon and i went to look at the folk in the park said $henry_baskerville$ but we had no trouble of any kind
it was imprudent all the same said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ shaking his #head# and looking very grave i beg #sir# $henry_baskerville$ that you will not go about alone
some great misfortune will befall you if you do did you get your other boot no #sir# it is gone forever
indeed that is very interesting well good bye he added as the train began to glide down the platform
bear in #mind# #sir# $henry_baskerville$ #one# of the phrases in that queer old legend which $dr_james_mortimer$ has read to us and avoid the #moor# in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil are exalted
i looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the tall austere figure of $mr_sherlock_holmes$ standing motionless and gazing after us
the journey was a swift and pleasant #one# and i spent it in making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing with $dr_james_mortimer$ spaniel
in a very few hours the brown earth had become ruddy the brick had changed to granite and red cows grazed in well hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer if a damper climate
young $henry_baskerville$ stared eagerly out of the #window# and cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features of the devon scenery
i ve been over a good part of the world since i left it $dr_watson$ said he but i have never seen a #place# to compare with it
i never saw a devonshire #man# who did not swear by his county i remarked it depends upon the breed of #man# quite as much as on the county said $dr_james_mortimer$
a glance at our #friend# here reveals the rounded #head# of the celt which carries inside it the celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment
poor #sir# $charles_baskerville$ #head# was of a very rare type half gaelic half ivernian in its characteristics but you were very young when you last saw $henry_baskerville$ hall were you not
i was a boy in my teens at the #time# of my father #death# and had never seen the hall for he lived in a little cottage on the south coast
i tell you it is all as new to me as it is to $dr_watson$ and i as keen as possible to see the #moor#
then your wish is easily granted for there is your first sight of the #moor# said $dr_james_mortimer$ pointing out of the carriage #window#
over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there rose in the distance a gray melancholy hill with a strange jagged summit dim and vague in the distance like some fantastic landscape in a dream
$henry_baskerville$ sat for a long #time# his #eye# fixed upon it and i read upon his eager #face# how much it meant to him this first sight of that strange spot where the #man# of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so deep
there he sat with his tweed suit and his american accent in the corner of a prosaic railway carriage and yet as i looked at his dark and expressive #face# i felt more than ever how true a descendant he was of that long line of high blooded fiery and masterful #man#
thence i went straight to a #friend# in america are you there were pride valour and strength in his thick brows his sensitive nostrils and his large hazel #eye#
if on that forbidding #moor# a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us this was at least a comrade for whom #one# might venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely share it
the train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all descended outside beyond the low white fence a wagonette with a pair of cobs was waiting
it was a sweet simple country spot but i was surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly #man# in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed
the coachman a hard faced gnarled little fellow saluted #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and in a few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad white road
rolling pasture lands curved upward on either #side# of us and old gabled #house# peeped out from amid the thick green foliage but behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever dark against the evening sky the long gloomy curve of the #moor# broken by the jagged and sinister hills
the wagonette swung round into a #side# road and we curved upward through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels high banks on either #side# heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart tongue ferns
our coming was evidently a great event for station master and porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the #light# of the sinking sun
still steadily rising we passed over a narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushed swiftly down foaming and roaring amid the gray boulders
both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak and fir at every turn $henry_baskerville$ gave an exclamation of delight looking eagerly about him and asking countless questions
to his #eye# all seemed beautiful but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the countryside which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year
the rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation sad gifts as it seemed to me for nature to throw before the carriage of the returning heir of the baskervilles
yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed halloa cried $dr_james_mortimer$ what is this
on the summit hard and clear like an equestrian statue upon its pedestal was a mounted soldier dark and stern his rifle poised ready over his forearm
a steep curve of heath clad land an outlying spur of the #moor# lay in front of us he was watching the road along which we travelled
what is this perkins asked $dr_james_mortimer$ our driver half turned in his seat there a convict escaped from princetown #sir#
he been out three #day# now and the warders watch every road and every station but they ve had no sight of him yet
the farmers about here dont like it #sir# and that a #fact# well i understand that they get five pounds if they can give information
yes #sir# but the chance of five pounds is but a poor #thing# compared to the chance of having your throat cut
you see it isnt like any ordinary convict this is a #man# that would stick at #nothing# who is he then
i remembered the #case# well for it was #one# in which $mr_sherlock_holmes$ had taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin
the commutation of his #death# sentence had been due to some doubts as to his complete sanity so atrocious was his conduct
our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us rose the huge expanse of the #moor# mottled with gnarled and craggy cairns and tors
somewhere there on that desolate plain was lurking this fiendish #man# hiding in a burrow like a wild beast his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out
it is $selden$ the notting hill murderer a cold wind swept down from it and set us shivering it needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren waste the chilling wind and the darkling sky
even $henry_baskerville$ fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely around him we had left the fertile country behind and beneath us
we looked back on it now the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands
now and then we passed a moorland cottage walled and roofed with stone with no creeper to break its harsh outline
suddenly we looked down into a cuplike depression patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm
the road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and olive slopes sprinkled with giant boulders two high narrow towers rose over the trees
the driver pointed with his whip $henry_baskerville$ hall said he its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining #eye#
a few minutes later we had reached the lodge gates a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron with weather bitten pillars on either #side# blotched with lichens and surmounted by the boars #head# of the baskervilles
the lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of rafters but facing it was a new building half constructed the first fruit of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ south african gold
through the gateway we passed into the avenue where the wheels were again hushed amid the leaves and the old trees shot their branches in a sombre tunnel over our #head#
$henry_baskerville$ shuddered as he looked up the long dark drive to where the $merripit_house$ glimmered like a ghost at the farther end
was it here he asked in a low voice no no the yew alley is on the other #side#
it no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such a #place# as this said he
i ll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months and you wont know it again with a thousand candle power swan and edison right here in front of the hall #door#
the young heir glanced round with a gloomy #face# it enough to scare any #man# the avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf and the $merripit_house$ lay before us
in the fading #light# i could see that the centre was a heavy block of building from which a porch projected
the whole front was draped in ivy with a patch clipped bare here and there where a #window# or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil
from this central block rose the twin towers ancient crenelated and pierced with many loopholes to right and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite
a dull #light# shone through heavy mullioned #window# and from the high chimneys which rose from the steep high angled roof there sprang a single black column of smoke
welcome #sir# $henry_baskerville$ welcome to $henry_baskerville$ hall a tall #man# had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the #door# of the wagonette
the figure of a #woman# was silhouetted against the yellow #light# of the hall she came out and helped the #man# to #hand# down our bags
you dont #mind# my driving straight home #sir# $henry_baskerville$ said $dr_james_mortimer$ my #wife# is expecting me surely you will stay and have some dinner
i would stay to show you over the $merripit_house$ but $mrs_barrymore$ will be a better guide than i good bye and never hesitate #night# or #day# to send for me if i can be of service
the wheels died away down the drive while #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and i turned into the hall and the #door# clanged heavily behind us
it was a fine apartment in which we found ourselves large lofty and heavily raftered with huge baulks of age blackened oak
no i must go i shall probably find some work awaiting me in the great old fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log fire crackled and snapped
then we gazed round us at the high thin #window# of old stained glass the oak panelling the stags #head# the coats of arms upon the walls all dim and sombre in the subdued #light# of the central lamp
#sir# $henry_baskerville$ and i held out our #hand# to it for we were numb from our long drive it just as i imagined it said #sir# $henry_baskerville$
is it not the very picture of an old #family# home to think that this should be the same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived
it strikes me solemn to think of it i saw his dark #face# lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about him
the #light# beat upon him where he stood but long shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him
$mrs_barrymore$ had returned from taking our luggage to our #room# he stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a well trained servant
he was a remarkable looking #man# tall handsome with a square black beard and pale distinguished features would you wish dinner to be served at once #sir#
my #wife# and i will be happy #sir# $henry_baskerville$ to stay with you until you have made your fresh arrangements but you will understand that under the new conditions this $merripit_house$ will require a considerable staff
i only meant #sir# that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ led a very retired #life# and we were able to look after his wants
is it ready in a very few minutes #sir# you will find hot water in your #room# what new conditions you would naturally wish to have more company and so you will need changes in your household
do you mean that your #wife# and you wish to leave only when it is quite convenient to you #sir#
but your #family# have been with us for several generations have they not i should be sorry to begin my #life# here by breaking an old #family# connection
i seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler white #face# i feel that also #sir# and so does my #wife#
but to tell the truth #sir# we were both very much attached to #sir# $charles_baskerville$ and his #death# gave us a shock and made these surroundings very painful to us
i fear that we shall never again be easy in our #mind# at $henry_baskerville$ hall but what do you intend to do
i have no doubt #sir# that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves in some business #sir# $charles_baskerville$ generosity has given us the means to do so
and now #sir# perhaps i had best show you to your #room# a square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall approached by a double stair
from this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building from which all the bedrooms opened my own was in the same wing as $henry_baskerville$ and almost next #door# to it
these #room# appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the $merripit_house$ and the bright paper and numerous candles did #something# to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my #mind#
it was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where the #family# sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependents
but the dining #room# which opened out of the hall was a #place# of shadow and gloom at #one# end a minstrel gallery overlooked it
with rows of flaring torches to #light# it up and the colour and rude hilarity of an old #time# banquet it might have softened but now when two black clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of #light# thrown by a shaded lamp #one# voice became hushed and #one# spirit subdued
a dim line of ancestors in every variety of dress from the elizabethan knight to the buck of the regency stared down upon us and daunted us by their silent company
we talked little and i for #one# was glad when the meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern billiard #room# and smoke a cigarette
black beams shot across above our #head# with a smoke darkened ceiling beyond them my #word# it isnt a very cheerful #place# said #sir# $henry_baskerville$
i dont wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone in such a $merripit_house$ as this
i suppose #one# can tone down to it but i feel a bit out of the picture at present however if it suits you we will retire early tonight and perhaps #thing# may seem more cheerful in the #morning#
i drew aside my curtains before i went to bed and looked out from my #window# it opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall #door#
beyond two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind a half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds
in its cold #light# i saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks and the long low curve of the melancholy #moor#
i closed the curtain feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest and yet it was not quite the last
i found myself weary and yet wakeful tossing restlessly from #side# to #side# seeking for the sleep which would not come
far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the hours but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old $merripit_house$
and then suddenly in the very dead of the #night# there came a sound to my ears clear resonant and unmistakable
it was the sob of a #woman# the muffled strangling gasp of #one# who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow i sat up in bed and listened intently
for half an hour i waited with every nerve on the alert but there came no other sound save the chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall
the noise could not have been far away and was certainly in the $merripit_house$ chapter the stapletons of $merripit_house$
the fresh beauty of the following #morning# did #something# to efface from our #mind# the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience of $henry_baskerville$ hall
as #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned #window# throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered them
the dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before
i guess it is ourselves and not the $merripit_house$ that we have to blame said the #baronet# we were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive so we took a gray view of the #place#
now we are fresh and well so it is all cheerful once more and yet it was not entirely a question of imagination i answered
did you for example happen to hear someone a #woman# i think sobbing in the #night# that is curious for i did when i was half asleep fancy
i waited quite a #time# but there was no more of it so i concluded that it was all a dream
that i heard #something# of the sort i heard it distinctly and i am sure that it was really the sob of a #woman#
we must ask about this right away he rang the bell and asked $mrs_barrymore$ whether he could account for our experience
it seemed to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he listened to his master question
there are only two #woman# in the $merripit_house$ #sir# $henry_baskerville$ he answered #one# is the scullery maid who sleeps in the other wing
the other is my #wife# and i can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her
and yet he lied as he said it for it chanced that after breakfast i met $mrs_barrymore$ in the long corridor with the sun full upon her #face#
she was a large impassive heavy featured #woman# with a stern set expression of mouth but her telltale #eye# were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids
it was she then who wept in the #night# and if she did so her husband must know it yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in declaring that it was not so
why had he done this and why did she weep so bitterly already round this pale faced handsome black bearded #man# there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom
it was he who had been the first to discover the body of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ and we had only his #word# for all the circumstances which led up to the old #man# #death#
was it possible that it was $mrs_barrymore$ after all whom we had seen in the cab in regent street the beard might well have been the same
the cabman had described a somewhat shorter #man# but such an impression might easily have been erroneous how could i settle the point forever
obviously the first #thing# to do was to see the grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in $mrs_barrymore$ own #hand#
be the answer what it might i should at least have #something# to report to $mr_sherlock_holmes$ #sir# $henry_baskerville$ had numerous papers to examine after breakfast so that the #time# was propitious for my excursion
it was a pleasant walk of four miles along the edge of the #moor# leading me at last to a small gray hamlet in which two larger buildings which proved to be the inn and the $merripit_house$ of $dr_james_mortimer$ stood high above the rest
the postmaster who was also the village grocer had a clear recollection of the telegram certainly #sir# said he i had the telegram delivered to mr $mrs_barrymore$ exactly as directed
who delivered it my boy here $dr_james_mortimer$ you delivered that telegram to mr $mrs_barrymore$ at the hall last week did you not
well he was up in the loft at the #time# so that i could not put it into his own #hand# but i gave it into $mrs_barrymore$ #hand# and she promised to deliver it at once
yes father i delivered it into his own #hand# i asked did you see mr $mrs_barrymore$ no #sir# i tell you he was in the loft
if you didnt see him how do you know he was in the loft well surely his own #wife# ought to know where he is said the postmaster testily
it seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther but it was clear that in spite of $mr_sherlock_holmes$ ruse we had no proof that $mrs_barrymore$ had not been in london all the #time#
suppose that it were so suppose that the same #man# had been the last who had seen #sir# $charles_baskerville$ alive and the first to dog the new heir when he returned to england
didnt he get the telegram if there is any mistake it is for mr $mrs_barrymore$ himself to complain what then
was he the agent of others or had he some sinister design of his own what interest could he have in persecuting the $henry_baskerville$ #family#
i thought of the strange warning clipped out of the leading article of the #time# was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes
the only conceivable motive was that which had been suggested by #sir# $henry_baskerville$ that if the #family# could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home would be secured for the barrymores
but surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible net round the young #baronet#
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ himself had said that no more complex #case# had come to him in all the long series of his sensational investigations
i prayed as i walked back along the gray lonely road that my #friend# might soon be freed from his preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders
suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet behind me and by a voice which called me by #name#
he was a small slim clean shaven prim faced #man# flaxen haired and leanjawed between thirty and forty years of age dressed in a gray suit and wearing a straw hat
a tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly net in #one# of his #hand#
you will i am sure excuse my presumption $dr_watson$ said he as he came panting up to where i stood
i turned expecting to see $dr_james_mortimer$ but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing me
here on the #moor# we are homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions you may possibly have heard my #name# from our mutual #friend# $dr_james_mortimer$
your net and box would have told me as much said i for i knew that $mr_stapleton$ was a naturalist
i have been calling on $dr_james_mortimer$ and he pointed you out to me from the #window# of his surgery as you passed
i am $mr_stapleton$ of $merripit_house$ but how did you know me as our road lay the same #way# i thought that i would overtake you and introduce myself
we were all rather afraid that after the sad #death# of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ the new #baronet# might refuse to live here
it is asking much of a wealthy #man# to come down and bury himself in a #place# of this kind but i need not tell you that it means a very great deal to the countryside
i trust that #sir# $henry_baskerville$ is none the worse for his journey he is very well thank you #sir# $henry_baskerville$ has i suppose no superstitious fears in the #matter#
i do not think that it is likely of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the #family#
i have heard it it is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature upon the #moor#
he spoke with a smile but i seemed to read in his #eye# that he took the #matter# more seriously
the story took a great hold upon the imagination of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ and i have no doubt that it led to his tragic end
his nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart
but how i fancy that he really did see #something# of the kind upon that last #night# in the yew alley
i feared that some disaster might occur for i was very fond of the old #man# and i knew that his heart was weak
how did you know that my #friend# $dr_james_mortimer$ told me you think then that some dog pursued #sir# $charles_baskerville$ and that he died of fright in consequence
the #word# took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid #face# and steadfast #eye# of my companion showed that no surprise was intended
have you any better explanation i have not come to any conclusion has $mr_sherlock_holmes$ it is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you $dr_watson$ said he
the records of your detective have reached us here and you could not celebrate him without being known yourself when $dr_james_mortimer$ told me your #name# he could not deny your identity
if you are here then it follows that $mr_sherlock_holmes$ is interesting himself in the #matter# and i am naturally curious to know what view he may take
i am afraid that i cannot answer that question may i ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself
he cannot leave town at present he has other #case# which engage his attention what a pity he might throw some #light# on that which is so dark to us
but as to your own researches if there is any possible #way# in which i can be of service to you
if i had any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to investigate the #case# i might perhaps even now give you some aid or advice
i assure you that i am simply here upon a visit to my #friend# #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and that i need no help of any kind
i trust that you will command me excellent said $mr_stapleton$ you are perfectly right to be wary and discreet
i am justly reproved for what i feel was an unjustifiable intrusion and i promise you that i will not mention the #matter# again
we had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the #moor#
a steep boulder sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone #day# been cut into a granite quarry the #face# which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff with ferns and brambles growing in its niches
from over a distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke a moderate walk along this #moor# path brings us to $merripit_house$ said he
perhaps you will spare an hour that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister my first thought was that i should be by #sir# $henry_baskerville$ #side#
but then i remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was littered it was certain that i could not help with those
and $mr_sherlock_holmes$ had expressly said that i should study the neighbours upon the #moor# i accepted $mr_stapleton$ invitation and we turned together down the path
it is a wonderful #place# the #moor# said he looking round over the undulating downs long green rollers with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges
you never tire of the #moor# you cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains it is so vast and so barren and so mysterious
you know it well then i have only been here two years the residents would call me a newcomer we came shortly after #sir# $charles_baskerville$ settled
but my tastes led me to explore every part of the country round and i should think that there are few #man# who know it better than i do
is it hard to know very hard you see for example this great plain to the north here with the queer hills breaking out of it
do you observe #anything# remarkable about that it would be a rare #place# for a gallop you would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their #life# before now
you notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it yes they seem more fertile than the rest $mr_stapleton$ laughed
that is the great grimpen mire said he a false step yonder means #death# to #man# or beast only yesterday i saw #one# of the #moor# ponies wander into it
i saw his #head# for quite a long #time# craning out of the bog hole but it sucked him down at last
even in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it but after these autumn rains it is an awful #place#
he never came out and yet i can find my #way# to the very heart of it and return alive by george there is another of those miserable ponies
#something# brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges then a long agonized writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed over the #moor#
it turned me cold with horror but my companion nerves seemed to be stronger than mine it gone said he
two in two #day# and many more perhaps for they get in the #way# of going there in the dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches
the mire has him it a bad #place# the great grimpen mire and you say you can penetrate it
yes there are #one# or two paths which a very active #man# can take i have found them out
they are really islands cut off on all #side# by the impassable mire which has crawled round them in the course of years
but why should you wish to go into so horrible a #place# well you see the hills beyond that is where the rare plants and the butterflies are if you have the wit to reach them
i shall try my luck some #day# he looked at me with a surprised #face# for god sake put such an idea out of your #mind# said he
your blood would be upon my #head# i assure you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive
it is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that i am able to do it halloa i cried what is that
a long low moan indescribably sad swept over the #moor# it filled the whole air and yet it was impossible to say whence it came
from a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar and then sank back into a melancholy throbbing murmur once again
$mr_stapleton$ looked at me with a curious expression in his #face# queer #place# the #moor# said he but what is it
the peasants say it is the #hound# of the baskervilles calling for its prey i ve heard it once or twice before but never quite so loud
i looked round with a chill of fear in my heart at the huge swelling plain mottled with the green patches of rushes
#nothing# stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens which croaked loudly from a tor behind us
you are an educated #man# you dont believe such nonsense as that said i what do you think is the cause of
so strange a sound bogs make queer noises sometimes it the mud settling or the water rising or #something# no no that was a living voice
well perhaps it was did you ever hear a bittern booming no i never did it a very rare bird practically extinct in england now but all #thing# are possible upon the #moor#
yes i should not be surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns
it the weirdest strangest #thing# that ever i heard in my #life# yes it rather an uncanny #place# altogether
look at the hillside yonder what do you make of those the whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone a score of them at least
prehistoric #man# lived thickly on the #moor# and as no #one# in particular has lived there since we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them
what are they sheep pens no they are the homes of our worthy ancestors these are his wigwams with the roofs off
you can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside but it is quite a town
he grazed his cattle on these slopes and he learned to dig for tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe
when was it inhabited neolithic #man# no date what did he do look at the great trench in the opposite hill
that is his mark yes you will find some very singular points about the #moor# $dr_watson$ oh excuse me an instant
a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path and in an instant $mr_stapleton$ was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it
to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire and my acquaintance never paused for an instant bounding from tuft to tuft behind it his green net waving in the air
it is surely cyclopides his gray clothes and jerky zigzag irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself
i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire when i heard the sound of steps and turning round found a #woman# near me upon the path
she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of $merripit_house$ but the dip of the #moor# had hid her until she was quite close
i could not doubt that this was the miss $mr_stapleton$ of whom i had been told since #lady# of any sort must be few upon the #moor# and i remembered that i had heard someone describe her as being a beauty
there could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister for $mr_stapleton$ was neutral tinted with #light# hair and gray #eye# while she was darker than any brunette whom i have seen in england slim elegant and tall
the #woman# who approached me was certainly that and of a most uncommon type she had a proud finely cut #face# so regular that it might have seemed impassive
were it not for the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark eager #eye# with her perfect figure and elegant dress she was indeed a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path
i had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory remark when her own #word# turned all my thoughts into a new channel
her #eye# were on her brother as i turned and then she quickened her pace towards me go back she said
go straight back to london instantly i could only stare at her in stupid surprise her #eye# blazed at me and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot
why should i go back i asked i cannot explain she spoke in a low eager voice with a curious lisp in her utterance
but for god sake do what i ask you go back and never set foot upon the #moor# again
but i have only just come #man# #man# she cried can you not tell when a warning is for your own good
go back to london start tonight get away from this #place# at all costs hush my brother is coming not a #word# of what i have said
we are very rich in orchids on the #moor# though of course you are rather late to see the beauties of the #place#
would you #mind# getting that orchid for me among the mare tails yonder $mr_stapleton$ had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and flushed with his exertions
halloa beryl said he and it seemed to me that the tone of his greeting was not altogether a cordial #one#
well jack you are very hot yes i was chasing a cyclopides he is very rare and seldom found in the late autumn
what a pity that i should have missed him he spoke unconcernedly but his small #light# #eye# glanced incessantly from the girl to me
you have introduced yourselves i can see yes i was telling #sir# $henry_baskerville$ that it was rather late for him to see the true beauties of the #moor#
why who do you think this is i imagine that it must be #sir# $henry_baskerville$ no no said i only a humble commoner but his #friend#
my #name# is $dr_watson$ a flush of vexation passed over her expressive #face# we have been talking at cross purposes said she
why you had not very much #time# for talk her brother remarked with the same questioning #eye# i talked as if $dr_watson$ were a resident instead of being merely a visitor said she
it cannot much #matter# to him whether it is early or late for the orchids but you will come on will you not and see $merripit_house$
a short walk brought us to it a bleak moorland $merripit_house$ once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous #day# but now put into repair and turned into a modern dwelling
an orchard surrounded it but the trees as is usual upon the #moor# were stunted and nipped and the effect of the whole #place# was mean and melancholy
inside however there were large #room# furnished with an elegance in which i seemed to recognize the taste of the #lady#
as i looked from their #window# at the interminable granite flecked #moor# rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon i could not but marvel at what could have brought this highly educated #man# and this beautiful #woman# to live in such a #place#
we were admitted by a strange wizened rusty coated old manservant who seemed in keeping with the $merripit_house$ queer spot to choose is it not said he as if in answer to my thought
and yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy do we not beryl quite happy said she but there was no ring of conviction in her #word#
the work to a #man# of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting but the privilege of living with youth of helping to mould those young #mind# and of impressing them with #one# own character and ideals was very dear to me
i had a school said $mr_stapleton$ it was in the north country however the fates were against us a serious epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died
and yet if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys i could rejoice over my own misfortune for with my strong tastes for botany and zoology i find an unlimited field of work here and my sister is as devoted to nature as i am
all this $dr_watson$ has been brought upon your #head# by your expression as you surveyed the #moor# out of our #window#
it never recovered from the blow and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up it certainly did cross my #mind# that it might be a little dull less for you perhaps than for your sister
no no i am never dull said she quickly we have books we have our studies and we have interesting neighbours
$dr_james_mortimer$ is a most learned #man# in his own line poor #sir# $charles_baskerville$ was also an admirable companion we knew him well and miss him more than i can tell
do you think that i should intrude if i were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of #sir# $henry_baskerville$
we may in our humble #way# do #something# to make #thing# more easy for him until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings
i am sure that he would be delighted then perhaps you would mention that i propose to do so will you come upstairs $dr_watson$ and inspect my collection of lepidoptera
i think it is the most complete #one# in the south west of england by the #time# that you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready
the melancholy of the #moor# the #death# of the unfortunate pony the weird sound which had been associated with the grim legend of the baskervilles all these #thing# tinged my thoughts with sadness
then on the top of these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of miss $mr_stapleton$ delivered with such intense earnestness that i could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it
i resisted all pressure to stay for lunch and i set off at once upon my return journey taking the grass grown path by which we had come
it seems however that there must have been some short cut for those who knew it for before i had reached the road i was astounded to see miss $mr_stapleton$ sitting upon a rock by the #side# of the track
but i was eager to get back to my charge her #face# was beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her #hand# to her #side#
i have run all the #way# in order to cut you off $dr_watson$ said she i had not even #time# to put on my hat
i wanted to say to you how sorry i am about the stupid mistake i made in thinking that you were #sir# $henry_baskerville$
i must not stop or my brother may miss me please forget the #word# i said which have no application whatever to you
but i cant forget them miss $mr_stapleton$ said i i am #sir# $henry_baskerville$ #friend# and his welfare is a very close concern of mine
tell me why it was that you were so eager that #sir# $henry_baskerville$ should return to london a #woman# whim $dr_watson$
when you know me better you will understand that i cannot always give reasons for what i say or do
please please be frank with me miss $mr_stapleton$ for ever since i have been here i have been conscious of shadows all round me
#life# has become like that great grimpen mire with little green patches everywhere into which #one# may sink and with no guide to point the track
no no i remember the thrill in your voice i remember the look in your #eye# tell me then what it was that you meant and i will promise to convey your warning to #sir# $henry_baskerville$
an expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her #face# but her #eye# had hardened again when she answered me
you make too much of it $dr_watson$ said she my brother and i were very much shocked by the #death# of #sir# $charles_baskerville$
he was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the #family# and when this tragedy came i naturally felt that there must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed
i was distressed therefore when another member of the #family# came down to live here and i felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run
we knew him very intimately for his favourite walk was over the #moor# to our $merripit_house$ that was all which i intended to convey
but what is the danger you know the story of the #hound# i do not believe in such nonsense
if you have any influence with #sir# $henry_baskerville$ take him away from a #place# which has always been fatal to his #family#
but i do the world is wide why should he wish to live at the #place# of danger because it is the #place# of danger
i fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it would be impossible to get him to move
that is #sir# $henry_baskerville$ nature i cannot say #anything# definite for i do not know #anything# definite i would ask you #one# more question miss $mr_stapleton$
if you meant no more than this when you first spoke to me why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said
my brother is very anxious to have the hall inhabited for he thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the #moor#
he would be very angry if he knew that i have said #anything# which might induce #sir# $henry_baskerville$ to go away
there is #nothing# to which he or anyone else could object but i have done my duty now and i will say no more
she turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders while i with my soul full of vague fears pursued my #way# to $henry_baskerville$ hall
first report of $dr_watson$ from this point onward i will follow the course of events by transcribing my own #letter# to $mr_sherlock_holmes$ which lie before me on the table
#one# page is missing but otherwise they are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more accurately than my memory clear as it is upon these tragic events can possibly do
i must go back or he will miss me and suspect that i have seen you good bye chapter $henry_baskerville$ hall october th
my previous #letter# and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has occurred in this most god forsaken corner of the world
the longer #one# stays here the more does the spirit of the #moor# sink into #one# soul its vastness and also its grim charm
when you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of modern england behind you but on the other #hand# you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people
on all #side# of you as you walk are the #house# of these forgotten folk with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples
as you look at their gray stone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind you and if you were to see a skin clad hairy #man# crawl out from the low #door# fitting a flint tipped arrow on to the string of his bow you would feel that his presence there was more natural than your own
my dear $mr_sherlock_holmes$ the strange #thing# is that they should have lived so thickly on what must always have been most unfruitful soil
i am no antiquarian but i could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which none other would occupy
all this however is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical #mind#
i can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round the sun
if you have not had any report within the last few #day# it is because up to today there was #nothing# of importance to relate
let me therefore return to the #fact# concerning #sir# $henry_baskerville$ then a very surprising circumstance occurred which i shall tell you in due course
but first of all i must keep you in touch with some of the other factors in the situation #one# of these concerning which i have said little is the escaped convict upon the #moor#
there is strong reason now to believe that he has got right away which is a considerable relief to the lonely householders of this district
a fortnight has passed since his flight during which he has not been seen and #nothing# has been heard of him
it is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the #moor# during all that #time# of course so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all
any #one# of these stone huts would give him a hiding #place# but there is #nothing# to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter #one# of the #moor# sheep
we are four able bodied #man# in this household so that we could take good care of ourselves but i confess that i have had uneasy moments when i have thought of the stapletons
we think therefore that he has gone and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence they live miles from any help
they would be helpless in the #hand# of a desperate fellow like this notting hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance
both #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and i were concerned at their situation and it was suggested that perkins the groom should go over to sleep there but $mr_stapleton$ would not hear of it
there are #one# maid an old manservant the sister and the brother the latter not a very strong #man# the #fact# is that our #friend# the #baronet# begins to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour
it is not to be wondered at for #time# hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active #man# like him and she is a very fascinating and beautiful #woman#
there is #something# tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires
he has certainly a very marked influence over her for i have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said
there is a dry glitter in his #eye# and a firm set of his thin lips which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature
he came over to call upon $henry_baskerville$ on that first #day# and the very next #morning# he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wicked hugo is supposed to have had its origin
it was an excursion of some miles across the #moor# to a #place# which is so dismal that it might have suggested the story
we found a short valley between rugged tors which led to an open grassy space flecked over with the white cotton grass
in the middle of it rose two great stones worn and sharpened at the upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast
i trust that he is kind to her you would find him an interesting study in every #way# it corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy
#sir# $henry_baskerville$ was much interested and asked $mr_stapleton$ more than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affairs of #man#
$mr_stapleton$ was guarded in his replies but it was easy to see that he said less than he might and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the #baronet#
he told us of similar #case# where #family# had suffered from some evil influence and he left us with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the #matter#
on our #way# back we stayed for lunch at $merripit_house$ and it was there that #sir# $henry_baskerville$ made the acquaintance of miss $mr_stapleton$
from the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her and i am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual
he referred to her again and again on our walk home and since then hardly a #day# has passed that we have not seen #something# of the brother and sister
he spoke lightly but it was evident that he was very much in earnest they dine here tonight and there is some talk of our going to them next week
#one# would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to $mr_stapleton$ and yet i have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation in his #face# when #sir# $henry_baskerville$ has been paying some attention to his sister
he is much attached to her no doubt and would lead a lonely #life# without her but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to stand in the #way# of her making
yet i am certain that he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love and i have several #time# observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being tete a tete
by the #way# your instructions to me never to allow #sir# $henry_baskerville$ to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love affair were to be added to our other difficulties
so brilliant a marriage my popularity would soon suffer if i were to carry out your orders to the #letter# the other #day# thursday to be more exact
he has been excavating a barrow at long down and has got a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy
the stapletons came in afterwards and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley at #sir# $henry_baskerville$ request to show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal #night#
it is a long dismal walk the yew alley between two high walls of clipped hedge with a narrow band of grass upon either #side#
$dr_james_mortimer$ lunched with us never was there such a single minded enthusiast as he at the far end is an old tumble down summer $merripit_house$
halfway down is the #moor# gate where the old gentleman left his cigar ash it is a white wooden gate with a latch
beyond it lies the wide #moor# i remembered your theory of the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred
as the old #man# stood there he saw #something# coming across the #moor# #something# which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion
there was the long gloomy tunnel down which he fled and from what a sheep dog of the #moor# or a spectral #hound# black silent and monstrous
was there a human agency in the #matter# did the pale watchful $mrs_barrymore$ know more than he cared to say it was all dim and vague but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind it
#one# other neighbour i have met since i wrote last this is $mr_frankland$ of lafter hall who #life# some four miles to the south of us
he is an elderly #man# red faced white haired and choleric his passion is for the british law and he has spent a large fortune in litigation
he fights for the mere pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take up either #side# of a question so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly amusement
at others he will with his own #hand# tear down some other #man# gate and declare that a path has existed there from #time# immemorial defying the owner to prosecute him for trespass
he is learned in old manorial and communal rights and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of fernworthy and sometimes against them so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the village street or else burned in effigy according to his latest exploit
he is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his #hand# at present which will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future
apart from the law he seems a kindly good natured person and i only mention him because you were particular that i should send some description of the people who surround us
he is curiously employed at present for being an amateur astronomer he has an excellent telescope with which he lies upon the roof of his own $merripit_house$ and sweeps the #moor# all #day# in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped convict
if he would confine his energies to this all would be well but there are rumours that he intends to prosecute $dr_james_mortimer$ for opening a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the neolithic skull in the barrow on long down
sometimes he will shut up a right of #way# and defy the parish to make him open it he helps to keep our #life# from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly needed
and now having brought you up to date in the escaped convict the stapletons $dr_james_mortimer$ and $mr_frankland$ of lafter hall let me end on that which is most important and tell you more about the barrymores and especially about the surprising development of last #night#
first of all about the test telegram which you sent from london in order to make sure that $mrs_barrymore$ was really here
i have already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was worthless and that we have no proof #one# #way# or the other
i told #sir# $henry_baskerville$ how the #matter# stood and he at once in his downright fashion had $mrs_barrymore$ up and asked him whether he had received the telegram himself
$mrs_barrymore$ said that he had did the boy deliver it into your own #hand# asked #sir# $henry_baskerville$ $mrs_barrymore$ looked surprised and considered for a little #time#
no said he i was in the box #room# at the #time# and my #wife# brought it up to me
did you answer it yourself no i told my #wife# what to answer and she went down to write it
in the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord i could not quite understand the object of your questions this #morning# #sir# $henry_baskerville$ said he
#sir# $henry_baskerville$ had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe the london outfit having now all arrived
i trust that they do not mean that i have done #anything# to forfeit your confidence $mrs_barrymore$ is of interest to me
she is a heavy solid person very limited intensely respectable and inclined to be puritanical you could hardly conceive a less emotional subject
yet i have told you how on the first #night# here i heard her sobbing bitterly and since then i have more than once observed traces of tears upon her #face#
sometimes i wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts her and sometimes i suspect $mrs_barrymore$ of being a domestic tyrant
i have always felt that there was #something# singular and questionable in this #man# character but the adventure of last #night# brings all my suspicions to a #head#
you are aware that i am not a very sound sleeper and since i have been on guard in this $merripit_house$ my slumbers have been lighter than ever
some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart and yet it may seem a small #matter# in itself last #night# about two in the #morning# i was aroused by a stealthy step passing my #room#
i rose opened my #door# and peeped out a long black shadow was trailing down the corridor it was thrown by a #man# who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his #hand#
he was in shirt and trousers with no covering to his feet i could merely see the outline but his height told me that it was $mrs_barrymore$
i have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs round the hall but that it is resumed upon the farther #side#
he walked very slowly and circumspectly and there was #something# indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance i waited until he had passed out of sight
when i came round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor and i could see from the glimmer of #light# through an open #door# that he had entered #one# of the #room#
and then i followed him now all these #room# are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever
the #light# shone steadily as if he were standing motionless i crept down the passage as noiselessly as i could and peeped round the corner of the #door#
his profile was half turned towards me and his #face# seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the #moor#
$mrs_barrymore$ was crouching at the #window# with the candle held against the glass for some minutes he stood watching intently then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the #light#
instantly i made my #way# back to my #room# and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey
long afterwards when i had fallen into a #light# sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock but i could not tell whence the sound came
what it all means i cannot guess but there is some secret business going on in this $merripit_house$ of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of
i have had a long talk with #sir# $henry_baskerville$ this #morning# and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last #night#
i do not trouble you with my theories for you asked me to furnish you only with #fact# i will not speak about it just now but it should make my next report interesting reading
if i was compelled to leave you without much news during the early #day# of my mission you must acknowledge that i am making up for lost #time# and that events are now crowding thick and fast upon us
in my last report i ended upon my top note with $mrs_barrymore$ at the #window# and now i have quite a budget already which will unless i am much mistaken considerably surprise you
chapter the #light# upon the #moor# second report of $dr_watson$ $henry_baskerville$ hall oct th my dear $mr_sherlock_holmes$ #thing# have taken a turn which i could not have anticipated
in some #way# they have within the last forty eight hours become much clearer and in some #way# they have become more complicated
before breakfast on the #morning# following my adventure i went down the corridor and examined the #room# in which $mrs_barrymore$ had been on the #night# before
the western #window# through which he had stared so intently has i noticed #one# peculiarity above all other #window# in the $merripit_house$ it commands the nearest outlook on to the #moor#
there is an opening between two trees which enables #one# from this point of view to look right down upon it while from all the other #window# it is only a distant glimpse which can be obtained
it follows therefore that $mrs_barrymore$ since only this #window# would serve the purpose must have been looking out for #something# or somebody upon the #moor#
but i will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself the #night# was very dark so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone
it had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot that would have accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his #wife#
the #man# is a striking looking fellow very well equipped to steal the heart of a country girl so that this theory seemed to have #something# to support it
that opening of the #door# which i had heard after i had returned to my #room# might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestine appointment
so i reasoned with myself in the #morning# and i tell you the direction of my suspicions however much the result may have shown that they were unfounded
but whatever the true explanation of $mrs_barrymore$ movements might be i felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until i could explain them was more than i could bear
i had an interview with the #baronet# in his study after breakfast and i told him all that i had seen
he was less surprised than i had expected i knew that $mrs_barrymore$ walked about #night# and i had a #mind# to speak to him about it said he
two or three #time# i have heard his steps in the passage coming and going just about the hour you #name#
perhaps then he pays a visit every #night# to that particular #window# i suggested perhaps he does if so we should be able to shadow him and see what it is that he is after
i wonder what your #friend# $mr_sherlock_holmes$ would do if he were here i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest said i
he would follow $mrs_barrymore$ and see what he did then we shall do it together but surely he would hear us
the #man# is rather deaf and in any #case# we must take our chance of that we ll sit up in my #room# tonight and wait until he passes
#sir# $henry_baskerville$ rubbed his #hand# with pleasure and it was evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet #life# upon the #moor#
the #baronet# has been in communication with the architect who prepared the plans for #sir# $charles_baskerville$ and with a contractor from london so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon
there have been decorators and furnishers up from plymouth and it is evident that our #friend# has large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his #family#
when the $merripit_house$ is renovated and refurnished all that he will need will be a #wife# to make it complete
between ourselves there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the #lady# is willing for i have seldom seen a #man# more infatuated with a #woman# than he is with our beautiful neighbour miss $mr_stapleton$
today for example its surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple which has caused our #friend# considerable perplexity and annoyance
and yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as #one# would under the circumstances expect after the conversation which i have quoted about $mrs_barrymore$ #sir# $henry_baskerville$ put on his hat and prepared to go out
as a #matter# of course i did the same what are you coming $dr_watson$ he asked looking at me in a curious #way#
that depends on whether you are going on the #moor# said i yes i am well you know what my instructions are
i am sorry to intrude but you heard how earnestly $mr_sherlock_holmes$ insisted that i should not leave you and especially that you should not go alone upon the #moor#
my dear fellow said he $mr_sherlock_holmes$ with all his wisdom did not foresee some #thing# which have happened since i have been on the #moor#
#sir# $henry_baskerville$ put his #hand# upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile you understand me i am sure that you are the last #man# in the world who would wish to be a spoil sport
i was at a loss what to say or what to do and before i had made up my #mind# he picked up his cane and was gone
but when i came to think the #matter# over my conscience reproached me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight
i imagined what my feelings would be if i had to return to you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your instructions
i must go out alone it put me in a most awkward position i assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought
it might not even now be too late to overtake him so i set off at once in the direction of $merripit_house$
i hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing #anything# of #sir# $henry_baskerville$ until i came to the point where the #moor# path branches off
there fearing that perhaps i had come in the wrong direction after all i mounted a hill from which i could command a view the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry
he was on the #moor# path about a quarter of a mile off and a #lady# was by his #side# who could only be miss $mr_stapleton$
thence i saw him at once it was clear that there was already an understanding between them and that they had met by appointment
they were walking slowly along in deep conversation and i saw her making quick little movements of her #hand# as if she were very earnest in what she was saying while he listened intently and once or twice shook his #head# in strong dissent
to follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to be an outrage and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to let him out of my sight
i stood among the rocks watching them very much puzzled as to what i should do next to act the spy upon a #friend# was a hateful task
still i could see no better course than to observe him from the hill and to clear my conscience by confessing to him afterwards what i had done
it is true that if any sudden danger had threatened him i was too far away to be of use and yet i am sure that you will agree with me that the position was very difficult and that there was #nothing# more which i could do
our #friend# #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and the #lady# had halted on the path and were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation when i was suddenly aware that i was not the only witness of their interview
a wisp of green floating in the air caught my #eye# and another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a #man# who was moving among the broken ground
it was $mr_stapleton$ with his butterfly net he was very much closer to the pair than i was and he appeared to be moving in their direction
his arm was round her but it seemed to me that she was straining away from him with her #face# averted
at this instant #sir# $henry_baskerville$ suddenly drew miss $mr_stapleton$ to his #side# he stooped his #head# to hers and she raised #one# #hand# as if in protest
next moment i saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round $mr_stapleton$ was the cause of the interruption he was running wildly towards them his absurd net dangling behind him
what the scene meant i could not imagine but it seemed to me that $mr_stapleton$ was abusing #sir# $henry_baskerville$ who offered explanations which became more angry as the other refused to accept them
finally $mr_stapleton$ turned upon his heel and beckoned in a peremptory #way# to his sister who after an irresolute glance at #sir# $henry_baskerville$ walked off by the #side# of her brother
he gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers the #lady# stood by in haughty silence the naturalist angry gestures showed that the #lady# was included in his displeasure
the #baronet# stood for a minute looking after them and then he walked slowly back the #way# that he had come his #head# hanging the very picture of dejection
what all this meant i could not imagine but i was deeply ashamed to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my #friend# knowledge
his #face# was flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled like #one# who is at his wit ends what to do
i ran down the hill therefore and met the #baronet# at the bottom halloa $dr_watson$ where have you dropped from said he
i explained everything to him how i had found it impossible to remain behind how i had followed him and how i had witnessed all that had occurred
for an instant his #eye# blazed at me but my frankness disarmed his anger and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh
you would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe #place# for a #man# to be private said he but by thunder the whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing and a mighty poor wooing at that
you dont mean to say that you came after me in spite of all where had you engaged a seat
i was on that hill quite in the back row eh but her brother was well up to the front did you see him come out on us
yes i did did he ever strike you as being crazy this brother of hers i cant say that he ever did
i always thought him sane enough until today but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a straitjacket
i dare say not what the #matter# with me anyhow you ve lived near me for some weeks $dr_watson$ tell me straight now
is there #anything# that would prevent me from making a good husband to a #woman# that i loved i should say not
he cant object to my worldly position so it must be myself that he has this down on what has he against me
i never hurt #man# or #woman# in my #life# that i know of and yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers
i tell you $dr_watson$ i ve only known her these few weeks but from the first i just felt that she was made for me and she too she was happy when she was with me and that i ll swear
did he say so that and a deal more there a #light# in a #woman# #eye# that speaks louder than #word#
it was only today for the first #time# that i saw a chance of having a few #word# with her alone
she was glad to meet me but when she did it was not love that she would talk about and she wouldnt have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it
she kept coming back to it that this was a #place# of danger and that she would never be happy until i had left it
i told her that since i had seen her i was in no hurry to leave it and that if she really wanted me to go the only #way# to work it was for her to arrange to go with me
with that i offered in as many #word# to marry her but before she could answer down came this brother of hers running at us with a #face# on him like a madman
but he has never let us get together and he was just white with rage and those #light# #eye# of his were blazing with fury
what was i doing with the #lady# how dared i offer her attentions which were distasteful to her did i think that because i was a #baronet# i could do what i liked
as it was i told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as i was not ashamed of and that i hoped that she might honour me by becoming my #wife#
that seemed to make the #matter# no better so then i lost my temper too and i answered him rather more hotly than i should perhaps considering that she was standing by
so it ended by his going off with her as you saw and here am i as badly puzzled a #man# as any in this county
if he had not been her brother i should have known better how to answer him just tell me what it all means $dr_watson$ and
i ll owe you more than ever i can hope to pay i tried #one# or two explanations but indeed i was completely puzzled myself
our #friend# title his fortune his age his character and his appearance are all in his favour and i know #nothing# against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his #family#
that his advances should be rejected so brusquely without any reference to the #lady# own wishes and that the #lady# should accept the situation without protest is very amazing
he had come to offer apologies for his rudeness of the #morning# and after a long private interview with #sir# $henry_baskerville$ in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the breach is quite healed and that we are to dine at $merripit_house$ next friday as a sign of it
i dont say now that he isnt a crazy #man# said #sir# $henry_baskerville$ i cant forget the look in his #eye# when he ran at me this #morning# but i must allow that no #man# could make a more handsome apology than he has done
however our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from $mr_stapleton$ himself that very afternoon did he give any explanation of his conduct
his sister is everything in his #life# he says that is natural enough and i am glad that he should understand her value
they have always been together and according to his account he has been a very lonely #man# with only her as a companion so that the thought of losing her was really terrible to him
he had not understood he said that i was becoming attached to her but when he saw with his own #eye# that it was really so and that she might be taken away from him it gave him such a shock that for a #time# he was not responsible for what he said or did
he was very sorry for all that had passed and he recognized how foolish and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful #woman# like his sister to himself for her whole #life#
but in any #case# it was a blow to him and it would take him some #time# before he could prepare himself to meet it
he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i would promise for three months to let the #matter# rest and to be content with cultivating the #lady# friendship during that #time# without claiming her love
if she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else this i promised and so the #matter# rests
so there is #one# of our small mysteries cleared up it is #something# to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering
we know now why $mr_stapleton$ looked with disfavour upon his sister suitor even when that suitor was so eligible a #one# as #sir# $henry_baskerville$
and now i pass on to another thread which i have extricated out of the tangled skein the mystery of the sobs in the #night# of the tear stained #face# of $mrs_barrymore$ of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice #window#
congratulate me my dear $mr_sherlock_holmes$ and tell me that i have not disappointed you as an agent that you do not regret the confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down
i have said by #one# #night# work but in truth it was by two #night# work for on the first we drew entirely blank
i sat up with #sir# $henry_baskerville$ in his #room# until nearly three clock in the #morning# but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs
all these #thing# have by #one# #night# work been thoroughly cleared it was a most melancholy vigil and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs
fortunately we were not discouraged and we determined to try again the next #night# we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the least sound
it was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into which he hopes the game may wander
when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more
#one# struck and two and we had almost for the second #time# given it up in despair we had heard the creak of a step in the passage
very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the distance then the #baronet# gently opened his #door# and we set out in pursuit
already our #man# had gone round the gallery and the corridor was all in darkness softly we stole along until we had come into the other wing
we were just in #time# to catch a glimpse of the tall black bearded figure his shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage
then he passed through the same #door# as before and the #light# of the candle framed it in the darkness and shot #one# single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor
we had taken the precaution of leaving our boots behind us but even so the old boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread
we shuffled cautiously towards it trying every plank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it sometimes it seemed impossible that he should fail to hear our approach
when at last we reached the #door# and peeped through we found him crouching at the #window# candle in #hand# his white intent #face# pressed against the pane exactly as i had seen him two #night# before
we had arranged no plan of campaign but the #baronet# is a #man# to whom the most direct #way# is always the most natural
he walked into the #room# and as he did so $mrs_barrymore$ sprang up from the #window# with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood livid and trembling before us
his dark #eye# glaring out of the white mask of his #face# were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from #sir# $henry_baskerville$ to me
however the #man# is fortunately rather deaf and he was entirely preoccupied in that which he was doing what are you doing here $mrs_barrymore$
his agitation was so great that he could hardly speak and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle
#nothing# #sir# it was the #window# #sir# i go round at #night# to see that they are fastened on the second floor
look here $mrs_barrymore$ said #sir# $henry_baskerville$ sternly we have made up our #mind# to have the truth out of you so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later
the fellow looked at us in a helpless #way# and he wrung his #hand# together like #one# who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery
yes #sir# all the #window# come now no lies what were you doing at that #window# i was doing no harm #sir#
i was holding a candle to the #window# and why were you holding a candle to the #window# dont ask me #sir# $henry_baskerville$ dont ask me
i give you my #word# #sir# that it is not my secret and that i cannot tell it if it concerned no #one#
but myself i would not try to keep it from you a sudden idea occurred to me and i took the candle from the trembling #hand# of the butler
he must have been holding it as a signal said i let us see if there is any answer
vaguely i could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the #moor# for the moon was behind the clouds
and then i gave a cry of exultation for a tiny pinpoint of yellow #light# had suddenly transfixed the dark veil and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square framed by the #window#
i held it as he had done and stared out into the darkness of the #night# there it is
i cried no no #sir# it is #nothing# nothing at all the butler broke in i assure you #sir# move your #light# across the #window# $dr_watson$ cried the #baronet#
see the other moves also now you rascal do you deny that it is a signal come speak up who is your confederate out yonder and what is this conspiracy that is going on
the #man# #face# became openly defiant it is my business and not yours i will not tell then you leave my employment right away
very good #sir# if i must i must and you go in disgrace by thunder you may well be ashamed of yourself
your #family# has lived with mine for over a hundred years under this roof and here i find you deep in some dark plot against me
it was a #woman# voice and $mrs_barrymore$ paler and more horror struck than her husband was standing at the #door#
her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling upon her #face#
no no #sir# no not against you we have to go eliza this is the end of it you can pack our #thing# said the butler
oh john john have i brought you to this it is my doing #sir# $henry_baskerville$ all mine he has done #nothing# except for my sake and because i asked him
speak out then what does it mean my unhappy brother is starving on the #moor# we cannot let him perish at our very gates
the #light# is a signal to him that food is ready for him and his #light# out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it
then your brother is the escaped convict #sir# $selden$ the criminal that the truth #sir# said $mrs_barrymore$ i said that it was not my secret and that i could not tell it to you
but now you have heard it and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you
this then was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at #night# and the #light# at the #window# #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and i both stared at the #woman# in amazement
was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of the same blood as #one# of the most notorious criminals in the country
we humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own #way# in everything until he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure and that he could do what he liked in it
then as he grew older he met wicked companions and the devil entered into him until he broke my mother heart and dragged our #name# in the dirt
from crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of god which has snatched him from the scaffold but to me #sir# he was always the little curly headed boy that i had nursed and played with as an elder sister would
yes #sir# my #name# was $selden$ and he is my younger brother that was why he broke prison #sir# he knew that i was here and that we could not refuse to help him
when he dragged himself here #one# #night# weary and starving with the warders hard at his heels what could we do
then you returned #sir# and my brother thought he would be safer on the #moor# than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over so he lay in hiding there
but every second #night# we made sure if he was still there by putting a #light# in the #window# and if there was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him
we took him in and fed him and cared for him every #day# we hoped that he was gone but as long as he was there we could not desert him
that is the whole truth as i am an honest christian #woman# and you will see that if there is blame in the #matter# it does not lie with my husband but with me for whose sake he has done all that he has
the #woman# #word# came with an intense earnestness which carried conviction with them is this true $mrs_barrymore$ yes #sir# $henry_baskerville$
every #word# of it well i cannot blame you for standing by your own #wife# forget what i have said
go to your #room# you two and we shall talk further about this #matter# in the #morning# when they were gone we looked out of the #window# again
#sir# $henry_baskerville$ had flung it open and the cold #night# wind beat in upon our #face# far away in the black distance there still glowed that #one# tiny point of yellow #light#
i wonder he dares said #sir# $henry_baskerville$ it may be so placed as to be only visible from here
very likely how far do you think it is out by the cleft tor i think not more than a mile or two off
hardly that well it cannot be far if $mrs_barrymore$ had to carry out the food to it and he is waiting this villain beside that candle
by thunder $dr_watson$ i am going out to take that #man# the same thought had crossed my own #mind# it was not as if the barrymores had taken us into their confidence
their secret had been forced from them the #man# was a danger to the community an unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse
we were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no harm with his brutal and violent nature others would have to pay the price if we held our #hand#
any #night# for example our neighbours the stapletons might be attacked by him and it may have been the thought of this which made #sir# $henry_baskerville$ so keen upon the adventure
i will come said i then get your revolver and put on your boots the sooner we start the better as the fellow may put out his #light# and be off
we hurried through the dark shrubbery amid the dull moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves
in five minutes we were outside the #door# starting upon our expedition the #night# air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay
now and again the moon peeped out for an instant but clouds were driving over the #face# of the sky and just as we came out on the #moor# a thin rain began to fall
the #light# still burned steadily in front are you armed i asked i have a hunting crop we must close in on him rapidly for he is said to be a desperate fellow
we shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can resist i say $dr_watson$ said the #baronet# what would $mr_sherlock_holmes$ say to this
as if in answer to his #word# there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of the #moor# that strange cry which i had already heard upon the borders of the great grimpen mire
it came with the wind through the silence of the #night# a long deep mutter then a rising howl and then the sad moan in which it died away
how about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted again and again it sounded the whole air throbbing with it strident wild and menacing
the #baronet# caught my sleeve and his #face# glimmered white through the darkness my god what that $dr_watson$ i dont know
it a sound they have on the #moor# i heard it once before it died away and an absolute silence closed in upon us
we stood straining our ears but #nothing# came $dr_watson$ said the #baronet# it was the cry of a #hound#
my blood ran cold in my veins for there was a break in his voice which told of the sudden horror which had seized him
what do they call this sound he asked who the folk on the countryside oh they are ignorant people
why should you #mind# what they call it tell me $dr_watson$ what do they say of it i hesitated but could not escape the question
they say it is the cry of the #hound# of the baskervilles he groaned and was silent for a few moments
a #hound# it was he said at last but it seemed to come from miles away over yonder i think
it was hard to say whence it came it rose and fell with the wind isnt that the direction of the great grimpen mire
yes it is well it was up there come now $dr_watson$ didnt you think yourself that it was the cry of a #hound#
i am not a child you need not fear to speak the truth $mr_stapleton$ was with me when i heard it last
he said that it might be the calling of a strange bird no no it was a #hound# my god can there be some truth in all these stories
is it possible that i am really in danger from so dark a cause you dont believe it do you $dr_watson$
and yet it was #one# #thing# to laugh about it in london and it is another to stand out here in the darkness of the #moor# and to hear such a cry as that
no no and my uncle there was the footprint of the #hound# beside him as he lay it all fits together
i dont think that i am a coward $dr_watson$ but that sound seemed to freeze my very blood feel my #hand#
it was as cold as a block of marble you ll be all right tomorrow i dont think i ll get that cry out of my #head#
what do you advise that we do now shall we turn back no by thunder we have come out to get our #man# and we will do it
we after the convict and a hell #hound# as likely as not after us come on we ll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon the #moor#
we stumbled slowly along in the darkness with the black loom of the craggy hills around us and the yellow speck of #light# burning steadily in front
there is #nothing# so deceptive as the distance of a #light# upon a pitch dark #night# and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us
a guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which flanked it on each #side# so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from being visible save in the direction of $henry_baskerville$ hall
but at last we could see whence it came and then we knew that we were indeed very close a boulder of granite concealed our approach and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal #light#
it was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle of the #moor# with no sign of #life# near it just the #one# straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each #side# of it
what shall we do now whispered #sir# $henry_baskerville$ wait here he must be near his #light# let us see if we can get a glimpse of him
over the rocks in the crevice of which the candle burned there was thrust out an evil yellow #face# a terrible animal #face# all seamed and scored with vile passions
foul with mire with a bristling beard and hung with matted hair it might well have belonged to #one# of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on the hillsides
the #light# beneath him was reflected in his small cunning #eye# which peered fiercely to right and left through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps of the hunters
it may have been that $mrs_barrymore$ had some private signal which we had neglected to give or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not well but i could read his fears upon his wicked #face#
the #word# were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him #something# had evidently aroused his suspicions any instant he might dash out the #light# and vanish in the darkness
at the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had sheltered us
i caught #one# glimpse of his short squat strongly built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run
i sprang forward therefore and #sir# $henry_baskerville$ did the same at the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds
we rushed over the brow of the hill and there was our #man# running with great speed down the other #side# springing over the stones in his #way# with the activity of a mountain goat
a lucky long shot of my revolver might have crippled him but i had brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an unarmed #man# who was running away
we were both swift runners and in fairly good training but we soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him
we saw him for a long #time# in the moonlight until he was only a small speck moving swiftly among the boulders upon the #side# of a distant hill
we ran and ran until we were completely blown but the space between us grew ever wider finally we stopped and sat panting on two rocks while we watched him disappearing in the distance
and it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and unexpected #thing# we had risen from our rocks and were turning to go home having abandoned the hopeless chase
the moon was low upon the right and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up against the lower curve of its silver disc
there outlined as black as an ebony statue on that shining background i saw the figure of a #man# upon the tor
do not think that it was a delusion $mr_sherlock_holmes$ i assure you that i have never in my #life# seen #anything# more clearly
he stood with his legs a little separated his arms folded his #head# bowed as if he were brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay before him
as far as i could judge the figure was that of a tall thin #man# he might have been the very spirit of that terrible #place#
it was not the convict this #man# was far from the #place# where the latter had disappeared besides he was a much taller #man#
with a cry of surprise i pointed him out to the #baronet# but in the instant during which i had turned to grasp his arm the #man# was gone
there was the sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon but its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure
the #baronet# nerves were still quivering from that cry which recalled the dark story of his #family# and he was not in the mood for fresh adventures
he had not seen this lonely #man# upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me
i wished to go in that direction and to search the tor but it was some distance away a warder no doubt said he
the #moor# has been thick with them since this fellow escaped well perhaps his explanation may be the right #one# but i should like to have some further proof of it
today we mean to communicate to the princetown people where they should look for their missing #man# but it is hard lines that we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our own prisoner
such are the adventures of last #night# and you must acknowledge my dear $mr_sherlock_holmes$ that i have done you very well in the #matter# of a report
much of what i tell you is no doubt quite irrelevant but still i feel that it is best that i should let you have all the #fact# and leave you to select for yourself those which will be of most service to you in helping you to your conclusions
so far as the barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions and that has cleared up the situation very much
we are certainly making some progress but the #moor# with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as ever
perhaps in my next i may be able to throw some #light# upon this also best of all would it be if you could come down to us
in any #case# you will hear from me again in the course of the next few #day# chapter extract from the diary of $dr_watson$
so far i have been able to quote from the reports which i have forwarded during these early #day# to $mr_sherlock_holmes$
now however i have arrived at a point in my narrative where i am compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my recollections aided by the diary which i kept at the #time#
a few extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory
i proceed then from the #morning# which followed our abortive chase of the convict and our other strange experiences upon the #moor#
the $merripit_house$ is banked in with rolling clouds which rise now and then to show the dreary curves of the #moor# with thin silver veins upon the #side# of the hills and the distant boulders gleaming where the #light# strikes upon their wet #face#
october th a dull and foggy #day# with a drizzle of rain it is melancholy outside and in the #baronet# is in a black reaction after the excitements of the #night#
i am conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger ever present danger which is the more terrible because i am unable to define it
and have i not cause for such a feeling consider the long sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is at work around us
there is the #death# of the last occupant of the hall fulfilling so exactly the conditions of the #family# legend and there are the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the #moor#
twice i have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the distant baying of a #hound# it is incredible impossible that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature
a spectral #hound# which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its howling is surely not to be thought of
$mr_stapleton$ may fall in with such a superstition and $dr_james_mortimer$ also but if i have #one# quality upon earth it is common sense and #nothing# will persuade me to believe in such a #thing#
to do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants who are not content with a mere fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell fire shooting from his mouth and #eye#
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ would not listen to such fancies and i am his agent but #fact# are #fact# and i have twice heard this crying upon the #moor#
suppose that there were really some huge #hound# loose upon it that would go far to explain everything but where could such a #hound# lie concealed where did it get its food where did it come from
how was it that no #one# saw it by #day# it must be confessed that the natural explanation offers almost as many difficulties as the other
and always apart from the #hound# there is the #fact# of the human agency in london the #man# in the cab and the #letter# which warned #sir# $henry_baskerville$ against the #moor#
this at least was real but it might have been the work of a protecting #friend# as easily as of an enemy
where is that #friend# or enemy now has he remained in london or has he followed us down here could he could he be the stranger whom i saw upon the tor
it is true that i have had only the #one# glance at him and yet there are some #thing# to which i am ready to swear
he is no #one# whom i have seen down here and i have now met all the neighbours the figure was far taller than that of $mr_stapleton$ far thinner than that of $mr_frankland$
$mrs_barrymore$ it might possibly have been but we had left him behind us and i am certain that he could not have followed us
a stranger then is still dogging us just as a stranger dogged us in london we have never shaken him off
if i could lay my #hand# upon that #man# then at last we might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties
to this #one# purpose i must now devote all my energies my first impulse was to tell #sir# $henry_baskerville$ all my plans
my second and wisest #one# is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to anyone he is silent and distrait
i will say #nothing# to add to his anxieties but i will take my own steps to attain my own end
his nerves have been strangely shaken by that sound upon the #moor# we had a small scene this #morning# after breakfast
sitting in the billiard #room# i more than once heard the sound of voices raised and i had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion
$mrs_barrymore$ asked leave to speak with #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and they were closeted in his study some little #time# after a #time# the #baronet# opened his #door# and called for me
he thinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother in law down when he of his own free will had told us the secret
$mrs_barrymore$ considers that he has a grievance he said the butler was standing very pale but very collected before us
i may have spoken too warmly #sir# said he and if i have i am sure that i beg your pardon
at the same #time# i was very much surprised when i heard you two gentlemen come back this #morning# and learned that you had been chasing $selden$
if you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different #thing# said the #baronet# you only told us or rather your #wife# only told us when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself
the poor fellow has enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track i didnt think you would have taken advantage of it #sir# $henry_baskerville$ indeed i didnt
the #man# is a public danger there are lonely #house# scattered over the #moor# and he is a fellow who would stick at #nothing#
you only want to get a glimpse of his #face# to see that look at $mr_stapleton$ $merripit_house$ for example with no #one# but himself to defend it
there no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key he ll break into no $merripit_house$ #sir# i give you my solemn #word# upon that
i assure you #sir# $henry_baskerville$ that in a very few #day# the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his #way# to south america
for god sake #sir# i beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the #moor#
but he will never trouble anyone in this country again they have given up the chase there and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him
you cant tell on him without getting my #wife# and me into trouble i beg you #sir# to say #nothing# to the police
what do you say $dr_watson$ i shrugged my shoulders if he were safely out of the country it would relieve the tax payer of a burden
but how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes he would not do #anything# so mad #sir#
we have provided him with all that he can want to commit a crime would be to show where he was hiding
that is true said #sir# $henry_baskerville$ well $mrs_barrymore$ god bless you #sir# and thank you from my heart it would have killed my poor #wife# had he been taken again
but after what we have heard i dont feel as if i could give the #man# up so there is an end of it
i guess we are aiding and abetting a felony $dr_watson$ all right $mrs_barrymore$ you can go with a few broken #word# of gratitude the #man# turned but he hesitated and then came back
you ve been so kind to us #sir# that i should like to do the best i can for you in return
i know #something# #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and perhaps i should have said it before but it was long after the inquest that i found it out
i ve never breathed a #word# about it yet to mortal #man# it about poor #sir# $charles_baskerville$ #death# the #baronet# and i were both upon our feet
do you know how he died no #sir# i dont know that what then i know why he was at the gate at that hour
it was to meet a #woman# to meet a #woman# he yes #sir# and the #woman# #name# i cant give you the #name# #sir# but i can give you the initials
her initials were l how do you know this $mrs_barrymore$ well #sir# $henry_baskerville$ your uncle had a #letter# that #morning#
he had usually a great many #letter# for he was a public #man# and well known for his kind heart so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him
but that #morning# as it chanced there was only this #one# #letter# so i took the more notice of it it was from $coombe_tracey$ and it was addressed in a #woman# #hand#
well #sir# i thought no more of the #matter# and never would have done had it not been for my #wife#
only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out #sir# $charles_baskerville$ study it had never been touched since his #death# and she found the ashes of a burned #letter# in the back of the grate
the greater part of it was charred to pieces but #one# little slip the end of a page hung together and the writing could still be read though it was gray on a black ground
it seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the #letter# and it said please please as you are a gentleman burn this #letter# and be at the gate by ten clock
well beneath it were signed the initials l have you got that slip no #sir# it crumbled all to bits after we moved it
had #sir# $charles_baskerville$ received any other #letter# in the same writing well #sir# i took no particular notice of his #letter#
i should not have noticed this #one# only it happened to come alone and you have no idea who l is
no #sir# no more than you have but i expect if we could lay our #hand# upon that #lady# we should know more about #sir# $charles_baskerville$ #death#
i cannot understand $mrs_barrymore$ how you came to conceal this important information well #sir# it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us
and then again #sir# we were both of us very fond of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ as we well might be considering all that he has done for us
to rake this up couldnt help our poor master and it well to go carefully when there a #lady# in the #case#
even the best of us you thought it might injure his reputation well #sir# i thought no good could come of it
but now you have been kind to us and i feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to tell you all that i know about the #matter#
very good $mrs_barrymore$ you can go when the butler had left us #sir# $henry_baskerville$ turned to me well $dr_watson$ what do you think of this new #light#
it seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before so i think but if we can only trace l it should clear up the whole business
we have gained that much we know that there is someone who has the #fact# if we can only find her
what do you think we should do let $mr_sherlock_holmes$ know all about it at once it will give him the clue for which he has been seeking
i am much mistaken if it does not bring him down i went at once to my #room# and drew up my report of the #morning# conversation for $mr_sherlock_holmes$
it was evident to me that he had been very busy of late for the notes which i had from baker street were few and short with no comments upon the information which i had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission
no doubt his blackmailing #case# is absorbing all his faculties and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest
i wish that he were here october th all #day# today the rain poured down rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves
i thought of the convict out upon the bleak cold shelterless #moor# poor devil whatever his crimes he has suffered #something# to atone for them
and then i thought of that other #one# the #face# in the cab the figure against the moon was he also out in that deluged the unseen watcher the #man# of darkness
in the evening i put on my waterproof and i walked far upon the sodden #moor# full of dark imaginings the rain beating upon my #face# and the wind whistling about my ears
i found the black tor upon which i had seen the solitary watcher and from its craggy summit i looked out myself across the melancholy downs
rain squalls drifted across their russet #face# and the heavy slate coloured clouds hung low over the landscape trailing in gray wreaths down the #side# of the fantastic hills
in the distant hollow on the left half hidden by the mist the two thin towers of $henry_baskerville$ hall rose above the trees
they were the only signs of human #life# which i could see save only those prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills
god help those who wander into the great mire now for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass nowhere was there any trace of that lonely #man# whom i had seen on the same spot two #night# before
as i walked back i was overtaken by $dr_james_mortimer$ driving in his dog cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of foulmire
he has been very attentive to us and hardly a #day# has passed that he has not called at the hall to see how we were getting on
he insisted upon my climbing into his dog cart and he gave me a lift homeward i found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel
i gave him such consolation as i might but i thought of the pony on the grimpen mire and i do not fancy that he will see his little dog again
by the #way# $dr_james_mortimer$ said i as we jolted along the rough road i suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom you do not know
it had wandered on to the #moor# and had never come back hardly any i think can you then tell me the #name# of any #woman# whose initials are l
there are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom i cant answer but among the farmers or gentry there is no #one# whose initials are those
he thought for a few minutes no said he wait a bit though he added after a pause
there is $mrs_laura_lyons$ her initials are l but she #life# in $coombe_tracey$ who is she i asked
she is $mr_frankland$ daughter what old $mr_frankland$ the crank exactly she married an artist named $mrs_laura_lyons$ who came sketching on the #moor#
he proved to be a blackguard and deserted her the fault from what i hear may not have been entirely on #one# #side#
her father refused to have #anything# to do with her because she had married without his consent and perhaps for #one# or two other reasons as well
so between the old sinner and the young #one# the girl has had a pretty bad #time# how does she live
i fancy old $mr_frankland$ allows her a pittance but it cannot be more for his own affairs are considerably involved whatever she may have deserved #one# could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad
her story got about and several of the people here did #something# to enable her to earn an honest living $mr_stapleton$ did for #one# and #sir# $charles_baskerville$ for another
he wanted to know the object of my inquiries but i managed to satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much for there is no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence
tomorrow #morning# i shall find my #way# to $coombe_tracey$ and if i can see this $mrs_laura_lyons$ of equivocal reputation a long step will have been made towards clearing #one# incident in this chain of mysteries
i am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent for when $dr_james_mortimer$ pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent i asked him casually to what type $mr_frankland$ skull belonged and so heard #nothing# but craniology for the rest of our drive
i gave a trifle myself it was to set her up in a typewriting business i have not lived for years with $mr_sherlock_holmes$ for #nothing#
this was my conversation with $mrs_barrymore$ just now which gives me #one# more strong card which i can play in due #time#
i have only #one# other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy #day# $dr_james_mortimer$ had stayed to dinner and he and the #baronet# played ecarte afterwards
the butler brought me my coffee into the library and i took the chance to ask him a few questions
well said i has this precious relation of yours departed or is he still lurking out yonder i dont know #sir#
i hope to heaven that he has gone for he has brought #nothing# but trouble here i ve not heard of him since i left out food for him last and that was three #day# ago
did you see him then no #sir# but the food was gone when next i went that #way# then he was certainly there
so you would think #sir# unless it was the other #man# who took it i sat with my coffee cup halfway to my lips and stared at $mrs_barrymore$
you know that there is another #man# then yes #sir# there is another #man# upon the #moor# have you seen him
no #sir# how do you know of him then $selden$ told me of him #sir# a week ago or more
he in hiding too but he not a convict as far as i can make out i dont like it $dr_watson$
i tell you straight #sir# that i dont like it he spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness now listen to me $mrs_barrymore$
i have no interest in this #matter# but that of your master i have come here with no object except to help him
$mrs_barrymore$ hesitated for a moment as if he regretted his outburst or found it difficult to express his own feelings in #word#
tell me frankly what it is that you dont like it all these goings on #sir# he cried at last waving his #hand# towards the rain lashed #window# which faced the #moor#
there foul play somewhere and there black villainy brewing to that i ll swear very glad i should be #sir# to see #sir# $henry_baskerville$ on his #way# back to london again
but what is it that alarms you look at #sir# $charles_baskerville$ #death# that was bad enough for all that the coroner said
look at the noises on the #moor# at #night# there not a #man# would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it
it means no good to anyone of the #name# of $henry_baskerville$ and very glad i shall be to be quit of it all on the #day# that #sir# $henry_baskerville$ new servants are ready to take over the hall
look at this stranger hiding out yonder and watching and waiting what he waiting for what does it mean but about this stranger said i
can you tell me #anything# about him what did $selden$ say did he find out where he hid or what he was doing
at first he thought that he was the police but soon he found that he had some lay of his own
a kind of gentleman he was as far as he could see but what he was doing he could not make out
he saw him once or twice but he is a deep #one# and gives #nothing# away and where did he say that he lived
among the old #house# on the hillside the stone huts where the old folk used to live but how about his food
$selden$ found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings all he needs i dare say he goes to $coombe_tracey$ for what he wants
when the butler had gone i walked over to the black #window# and i looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline of the wind swept trees
very good $mrs_barrymore$ we may talk further of this some other #time# it is a wild #night# indoors and what must it be in a stone hut upon the #moor#
what passion of hatred can it be which leads a #man# to lurk in such a #place# at such a #time#
there in that hut upon the #moor# seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has vexed me so sorely
i swear that another #day# shall not have passed before i have done all that #man# can do to reach the heart of the mystery
and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial chapter the #man# on the tor
the extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of october a #time# when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion
the incidents of the next few #day# are indelibly graven upon my recollection and i can tell them without reference to the notes made at the #time#
i start them from the #day# which succeeded that upon which i had established two #fact# of great importance the #one# that $mrs_laura_lyons$ of $coombe_tracey$ had written to #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ and made an appointment with him at the very #place# and hour that he met his #death# the other that the lurking #man# upon the #moor# was to be found among the stone huts upon the hillside
with these two #fact# in my possession i felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if i could not throw some further #light# upon these dark #place#
i had no opportunity to tell the #baronet# what i had learned about $mrs_laura_lyons$ upon the evening before for $dr_james_mortimer$ remained with him at cards until it was very late
at breakfast however i informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would care to accompany me to $coombe_tracey$
at first he was very eager to come but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if i went alone the results might be better
the more formal we made the visit the less information we might obtain i left #sir# $henry_baskerville$ behind therefore not without some prickings of conscience and drove off upon my new quest
when i reached $coombe_tracey$ i told perkins to put up the horses and i made inquiries for the #lady# whom i had come to interrogate
a maid showed me in without ceremony and as i entered the sitting #room# a #lady# who was sitting before a remington typewriter sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome
her #face# fell however when she saw that i was a stranger and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit
i had no difficulty in finding her #room# which were central and well appointed the first impression left by $mrs_laura_lyons$ was #one# of extreme beauty
her #eye# and hair were of the same rich hazel colour and her cheeks though considerably freckled were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the brunette the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose
there was #something# subtly wrong with the #face# some coarseness of expression some hardness perhaps of #eye# some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty
at the moment i was simply conscious that i was in the presence of a very handsome #woman# and that she was asking me the reasons for my visit
admiration was i repeat the first impression but the second was criticism but these of course are afterthoughts i had not quite understood until that instant how delicate my mission was
i have the pleasure said i of knowing your father it was a clumsy introduction and the #lady# made me feel it
there is #nothing# in common between my father and me she said i owe him #nothing# and his #friend# are not mine
if it were not for the late #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ and some other kind hearts i might have starved for all that my father cared
it was about the late #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ that i have come here to see you the freckles started out on the #lady# #face#
what can i tell you about him she asked and her fingers played nervously over the stops of her typewriter
if i am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took in my unhappy situation
you knew him did you not i have already said that i owe a great deal to his kindness did you correspond with him
the #lady# looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel #eye# what is the object of these questions
she asked sharply the object is to avoid a public scandal it is better that i should ask them here than that the #matter# should pass outside our control
she was silent and her #face# was still very pale at last she looked up with #something# reckless and defiant in her manner
well i ll answer she said what are your questions did you correspond with #sir# $charles_baskerville$ i certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity
have you the dates of those #letter# no have you ever met him yes once or twice when he came into $coombe_tracey$
but if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you as you say that he has done
he was a very retiring #man# and he preferred to do good by stealth she met my difficulty with the utmost readiness
there were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to help me #one# was $mr_stapleton$ a neighbour and intimate #friend# of #sir# $charles_baskerville$
i knew already that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ had made $mr_stapleton$ his almoner upon several occasions so the #lady# statement bore the impress of truth upon it
he was exceedingly kind and it was through him that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ learned about my affairs did you ever write to #sir# $charles_baskerville$ asking him to meet you
i continued $mrs_laura_lyons$ flushed with anger again really #sir# this is a very extraordinary question i am sorry madam but i must repeat it
then i answer certainly not not on the very #day# of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ #death# the flush had faded in an instant and a deathly #face# was before me
her dry lips could not speak the no which i saw rather than heard surely your memory deceives you said i
i could even quote a passage of your #letter# it ran please please as you are a gentleman burn this #letter# and be at the gate by ten clock
i thought that she had fainted but she recovered herself by a supreme effort is there no such #thing# as a gentleman
she gasped you do #sir# $charles_baskerville$ an injustice he did burn the #letter# but sometimes a #letter# may be legible even when burned
you acknowledge now that you wrote it yes i did write it she cried pouring out her soul in a torrent of #word#
i did write it why should i deny it i have no reason to be ashamed of it i wished him to help me
i believed that if i had an interview i could gain his help so i asked him to meet me
but why at such an hour because i had only just learned that he was going to london next #day# and might be away for months
there were reasons why i could not get there earlier but why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the $merripit_house$
do you think a #woman# could go alone at that hour to a bachelor $merripit_house$ well what happened when you did get there
i never went $mrs_laura_lyons$ no i swear it to you on all i hold sacred i never went
#something# intervened to prevent my going what was that that is a private #matter# i cannot tell it
you acknowledge then that you made an appointment with #sir# $charles_baskerville$ at the very hour and #place# at which he met his #death# but you deny that you kept the appointment
that is the truth again and again i cross questioned her but i could never get past that point
$mrs_laura_lyons$ said i as i rose from this long and inconclusive interview you are taking a very great responsibility and putting yourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean breast of all that you know
if your position is innocent why did you in the first instance deny having written to #sir# $charles_baskerville$ upon that date
if i have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are compromised
because i feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and that i might find myself involved in a scandal
and why were you so pressing that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ should destroy your #letter# if you have read the #letter# you will know
i did not say that i had read all the #letter# you quoted some of it i quoted the postscript
i ask you once again why it was that you were so pressing that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ should destroy this #letter# which he received on the #day# of his #death#
the #letter# had as i said been burned and it was not all legible the #matter# is a very private #one#
if you have heard #anything# of my unhappy history you will know that i made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it
the more reason why you should avoid a public investigation i will tell you then i have heard so much
the law is upon his #side# and every #day# i am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him
at the #time# that i wrote this #letter# to #sir# $charles_baskerville$ i had learned that there was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met
my #life# has been #one# incessant persecution from a husband whom i abhor it meant everything to me peace of #mind# happiness self respect everything
i knew #sir# $charles_baskerville$ generosity and i thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help me
then how is it that you did not go because i received help in the interval from another source
why then did you not write to #sir# $charles_baskerville$ and explain this so i should have done had i not seen his #death# in the paper next #morning#
i could only check it by finding if she had indeed instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the #time# of the tragedy
it was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been to $henry_baskerville$ hall if she really had been for a trap would be necessary to take her there and could not have returned to $coombe_tracey$ until the early hours of the #morning#
the #woman# story hung coherently together and all my questions were unable to shake it such an excursion could not be kept secret
the probability was therefore that she was telling the truth or at least a part of the truth i came away baffled and disheartened
once again i had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every path by which i tried to get at the object of my mission
and yet the more i thought of the #lady# #face# and of her manner the more i felt that #something# was being held back from me
why should she turn so pale why should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her why should she have been so reticent at the #time# of the tragedy
for the moment i could proceed no farther in that direction but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the #moor#
surely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she would have me believe and that was a most vague direction
$mrs_barrymore$ only indication had been that the stranger lived in #one# of these abandoned huts and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the #moor#
but i had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the #man# himself standing upon the summit of the black tor
i realized it as i drove back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people that then should be the centre of my search
if this #man# were inside it i should find out from his own lips at the point of my revolver if necessary who he was and why he had dogged us so long
he might slip away from us in the crowd of regent street but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely #moor#
on the other #hand# if i should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it i must remain there however long the vigil until he returned
from there i should explore every hut upon the #moor# until i lighted upon the right #one# $mr_sherlock_holmes$ had missed him in london
it would indeed be a triumph for me if i could run him to earth where my master had failed luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry but now at last it came to my aid
and the messenger of good fortune was none other than $mr_frankland$ who was standing gray whiskered and red faced outside the gate of his garden which opened on to the highroad along which i travelled
good #day# $dr_watson$ cried he with unwonted good humour you must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and to congratulate me
my feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what i had heard of his treatment of his daughter but i was anxious to send perkins and the wagonette home and the opportunity was a good #one#
i alighted and sent a message to #sir# $henry_baskerville$ that i should walk over in #time# for dinner then i followed $mr_frankland$ into his dining #room#
it is a great #day# for me #sir# #one# of the red #letter# #day# of my #life# he cried with many chuckles
i mean to teach them in these parts that law is law and that there is a #man# here who does not fear to invoke it
i have established a right of #way# through the centre of old middleton park slap across it #sir# within a hundred yards of his own front #door#
i have brought off a double event what do you think of that we ll teach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners confound them
these infernal people seem to think that there are no rights of property and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles
and i ve closed the wood where the fernworthy folk used to picnic both #case# decided $dr_watson$ and both in my favour
i havent had such a #day# since i had #sir# john morland for trespass because he shot in his own warren
how on earth did you do that look it up in the books #sir# it will repay reading $mr_frankland$ morland court of queen bench
it cost me pounds but i got my verdict did it do you any good none #sir# none i am proud to say that i had no interest in the #matter#
i act entirely from a sense of public duty i have no doubt for example that the fernworthy people will burn me in effigy tonight
the county constabulary is in a scandalous state #sir# and it has not afforded me the protection to which i am entitled
i told the police last #time# they did it that they should stop these disgraceful exhibitions the #case# of $mr_frankland$ regina will bring the #matter# before the attention of the public
i told them that they would have occasion to regret their treatment of me and already my #word# have come true
because i could tell them what they are dying to know but #nothing# would induce me to help the rascals in any #way#
i had been casting round for some excuse by which i could get away from his gossip but now i began to wish to hear more of it
i had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest #way# to stop his confidences
how so i asked the old #man# put on a very knowing expression some poaching #case# no doubt said i with an indifferent manner
ha ha my boy a very much more important #matter# than that what about the convict on the #moor#
i may not know exactly where he is but i am quite sure that i could help the police to lay their #hand# on him
has it never struck you that the #way# to catch that #man# was to find out where he got his food and so trace it to him
i stared you dont mean that you know where he is said i he certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth
no doubt said i but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the #moor# i know it because i have seen with my own #eye# the messenger who takes him his food
my heart sank for $mrs_barrymore$ it was a serious #thing# to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody
but his next remark took a weight from my #mind# you ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child
he passes along the same path at the same hour and to whom should he be going except to the convict
i see him every #day# through my telescope upon the roof here was luck indeed and yet i suppressed all appearance of interest
a child $mrs_barrymore$ had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy it was on his track and not upon the convict that $mr_frankland$ had stumbled
if i could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt but incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards
i should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of #one# of the moorland shepherds taking out his father dinner
the least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat his #eye# looked malignantly at me and his gray whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat
indeed #sir# said he pointing out over the wide stretching #moor# do you see that black tor over yonder well do you see the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it
it is the stoniest part of the whole #moor# is that a #place# where a shepherd would be likely to take his station
your suggestion #sir# is a most absurd #one# i meekly answered that i had spoken without knowing all the #fact#
my submission pleased him and led him to further confidences you may be sure #sir# that i have very good grounds before i come to an opinion
i have seen the boy again and again with his bundle every #day# and sometimes twice a #day# i have been able but wait a moment $dr_watson$
do my #eye# deceive me or is there at the present moment #something# moving upon that hillside it was several miles off but i could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray
come #sir# come cried $mr_frankland$ rushing upstairs you will see with your own #eye# and judge for yourself
the telescope a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod stood upon the flat leads of the $merripit_house$ $mr_frankland$ clapped his #eye# to it and gave a cry of satisfaction
quick $dr_watson$ quick before he passes over the hill there he was sure enough a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder toiling slowly up the hill
when he reached the crest i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky he looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air as #one# who dreads pursuit
then he vanished over the hill well am i right certainly there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand
and what the errand is even a county constable could guess but not #one# #word# shall they have from me and i bind you to secrecy also $dr_watson$
not a #word# you understand just as you wish they have treated me shamefully shamefully when the #fact# come out in $mr_frankland$ regina
i venture to think that a thrill of indignation will run through the country #nothing# would induce me to help the police in any #way#
for all they cared it might have been me instead of my effigy which these rascals burned at the stake surely you are not going
you will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion but i resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him from his announced intention of walking home with me
i kept the road as long as his #eye# was on me and then i struck off across the #moor# and made for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared
everything was working in my favour and i swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that i should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my #way#
the sun was already sinking when i reached the summit of the hill and the long slopes beneath me were all golden green on #one# #side# and gray shadow on the other
a haze lay low upon the farthest sky line out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of belliver and vixen tor over the wide expanse there was no sound and no movement
he and i seemed to be the only living #thing# between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it
the barren scene the sense of loneliness and the mystery and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart
#one# great gray bird a gull or curlew soared aloft in the blue heaven the boy was nowhere to be seen
but down beneath me in a cleft of the hills there was a circle of the old stone huts and in the middle of them there was #one# which retained sufficient roof to act as a screen against the weather
my heart leaped within me as i saw it this must be the burrow where the stranger lurked at last my foot was on the threshold of his hiding #place# his secret was within my grasp
as i approached the hut walking as warily as $mr_stapleton$ would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly i satisfied myself that the #place# had indeed been used as a habitation
a vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a #door# all was silent within the unknown might be lurking there or he might be prowling on the #moor#
throwing aside my cigarette i closed my #hand# upon the butt of my revolver and walking swiftly up to the #door# i looked in
my nerves tingled with the sense of adventure the #place# was empty but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false scent
this was certainly where the #man# lived some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic #man# had once slumbered
the ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half full of water
a litter of empty tins showed that the #place# had been occupied for some #time# and i saw as my #eye# became accustomed to the checkered #light# a pannikin and a half full bottle of spirits standing in the corner
in the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table and upon this stood a small cloth bundle the same no doubt which i had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy
as i set it down again after having examined it my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it
it contained a loaf of bread a tinned tongue and two tins of preserved peaches i raised it and this was what i read roughly scrawled in pencil $dr_watson$ has gone to $coombe_tracey$
for a minute i stood there with the paper in my #hand# thinking out the meaning of this curt message
he had not followed me himself but he had set an agent the boy perhaps upon my track and this was his report
it was i then and not #sir# $henry_baskerville$ who was being dogged by this secret #man# possibly i had taken no step since i had been upon the #moor# which had not been observed and reported
always there was this feeling of an unseen force a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that #one# realized that #one# was indeed entangled in its meshes
there was no trace however of #anything# of the kind nor could i discover any sign which might indicate the character or intentions of the #man# who lived in this singular #place# save that he must be of spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of #life#
when i thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode
if there was #one# report there might be others so i looked round the hut in search of them was he our malignant enemy or was he by chance our guardian angel
i swore that i would not leave the hut until i knew outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold
there were the two towers of $henry_baskerville$ hall and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the village of grimpen
its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant pools which lay amid the great grimpen mire between the two behind the hill was the $merripit_house$ of the stapletons
all was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening #light# and yet as i looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant was bringing nearer
with tingling nerves but a fixed purpose i sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant
and then at last i heard him far away came the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone then another and yet another coming nearer and nearer
i shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in my pocket determined not to discover myself until i had an opportunity of seeing #something# of the stranger
there was a long pause which showed that he had stopped then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut
it is a lovely evening my dear $dr_watson$ said a well known voice i really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in
chapter #death# on the #moor# for a moment or two i sat breathless hardly able to believe my ears
then my senses and my voice came back to me while a crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul
that cold incisive ironical voice could belong to but #one# #man# in all the world $mr_sherlock_holmes$ i cried $mr_sherlock_holmes$ come out said he and please be careful with the revolver
i stooped under the rude lintel and there he sat upon a stone outside his gray #eye# dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features
he was thin and worn but clear and alert his keen #face# bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind
in his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the #moor# and he had contrived with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was #one# of his characteristics that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he were in baker street
i never was more glad to see anyone in my #life# said i as i wrung him by the #hand#
or more astonished eh well i must confess to it the surprise was not all on #one# #side# i assure you
i had no idea that you had found my occasional retreat still less that you were inside it until i was within twenty paces of the #door#
my footprint i presume no $dr_watson$ i fear that i could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprints of the world
if you seriously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist for when i see the stub of a cigarette marked bradley oxford street i know that my #friend# $dr_watson$ is in the neighbourhood
you will see it there beside the path you threw it down no doubt at that supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut
i thought as much and knowing your admirable tenacity i was convinced that you were sitting in ambush a weapon within reach waiting for the tenant to return
exactly so you actually thought that i was the criminal i did not know who you were but i was determined to find out
you saw me perhaps on the #night# of the convict hunt when i was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me
excellent $dr_watson$ and how did you localize me yes i saw you then and have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this #one#
no your boy had been observed and that gave me a guide where to look the old gentleman with the telescope no doubt
i could not make it out when first i saw the #light# flashing upon the lens he rose and peeped into the hut
ha i see that cartwright has brought up some supplies what this paper so you have been to $coombe_tracey$ have you
our researches have evidently been running on parallel lines and when we unite our results i expect we shall have a fairly full knowledge of the #case#
well i am glad from my heart that you are here for indeed the responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my nerves
yes to see $mrs_laura_lyons$ exactly well done but how in the #name# of wonder did you come here and what have you been doing
i thought that you were in baker street working out that #case# of blackmailing that was what i wished you to think
then you use me and yet do not trust me i cried with some bitterness i think that i have deserved better at your #hand# $mr_sherlock_holmes$
my dear fellow you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other #case# and i beg that you will forgive me if i have seemed to play a trick upon you
in truth it was partly for your own sake that i did it and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the #matter# for myself
it is confident that my point of view would have been the same as yours and my presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their guard
as it is i have been able to get about as i could not possibly have done had i been living in the hall and i remain an unknown factor in the business ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment
had i been with #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and you but why keep me in the dark for you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led to my discovery
you would have wished to tell me #something# or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other and so an unnecessary risk would be run
i brought cartwright down with me you remember the little chap at the express office and he has seen after my simple wants a loaf of bread and a clean collar
he has given me an extra pair of #eye# upon a very active pair of feet and both have been invaluable
then my reports have all been wasted my voice trembled as i recalled the pains and the pride with which i had composed them
what does #man# want more $mr_sherlock_holmes$ took a bundle of papers from his pocket here are your reports my dear fellow and very well thumbed i assure you
i made excellent arrangements and they are only delayed #one# #day# upon their #way# i must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult #case#
i was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon me but the warmth of $mr_sherlock_holmes$ praise drove my anger from my #mind#
i felt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that i should not have known that he was upon the #moor#
and now tell me the result of your visit to $mrs_laura_lyons$ it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone for i am already aware that she is the #one# person in $coombe_tracey$ who might be of service to us in the #matter#
that better said he seeing the shadow rise from my #face# in #fact# if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that i should have gone tomorrow
the sun had set and dusk was settling over the #moor# the air had turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth
there sitting together in the twilight i told $mr_sherlock_holmes$ of my conversation with the #lady# so interested was he that i had to repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied
this is most important said he when i had concluded it fills up a gap which i had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair
you are aware perhaps that a close intimacy exists between this #lady# and the #man# $mr_stapleton$ i did not know of a close intimacy
there can be no doubt about the #matter# they meet they write there is a complete understanding between them now this puts a very powerful weapon into our #hand#
if i could only use it to detach his #wife# his #wife# i am giving you some information now in return for all that you have given me
the #lady# who has passed here as miss $mr_stapleton$ is in reality his #wife# good heavens $mr_sherlock_holmes$ are you sure of what you say
how could he have permitted #sir# $henry_baskerville$ to fall in love with her #sir# $henry_baskerville$ falling in love could do no harm to anyone except #sir# $henry_baskerville$
he took particular care that #sir# $henry_baskerville$ did not make love to her as you have yourself observed i repeat that the #lady# is his #wife# and not his sister
but why this elaborate deception because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free #woman#
in that impassive colourless #man# with his straw hat and his butterfly net i seemed to see #something# terrible a creature of infinite patience and craft with a smiling #face# and a murderous heart
all my unspoken instincts my vague suspicions suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist it is he then who is our enemy it is he who dogged us in london
so i read the riddle and the warning it must have come from her exactly the shape of some monstrous villainy half seen half guessed loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long
because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you and i dare say he has many a #time# regretted it since
but are you sure of this $mr_sherlock_holmes$ how do you know that the #woman# is his #wife# he was once a schoolmaster in the north of england
now there is no #one# more easy to trace than a schoolmaster there are scholastic agencies by which #one# may identify any #man# who has been in the profession
a little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances and that the #man# who had owned it the #name# was different had disappeared with his #wife#
the descriptions agreed when i learned that the missing #man# was devoted to entomology the identification was complete the darkness was rising but much was still hidden by the shadows
if this #woman# is in truth his #wife# where does $mrs_laura_lyons$ come in i asked that is #one# of the points upon which your own researches have shed a #light#
your interview with the #lady# has cleared the situation very much i did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband
in that #case# regarding $mr_stapleton$ as an unmarried #man# she counted no doubt upon becoming his #wife# and when she is undeceived
why then we may find the #lady# of service it must be our first duty to see her both of us tomorrow dont you think $dr_watson$ that you are away from your charge rather long
your #place# should be at $henry_baskerville$ hall the last red streaks had faded away in the west and #night# had settled upon the #moor#
a few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky #one# last question $mr_sherlock_holmes$ i said as i rose
surely there is no need of secrecy between you and me what is the meaning of it all what is he after
my nets are closing upon him even as his are upon #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and with your help he is already almost at my mercy
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ voice sank as he answered it is murder $dr_watson$ refined cold blooded deliberate murder do not ask me for particulars there is but #one# danger which can threaten us
another #day# two at the most and i have my #case# complete but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child
it is that he should strike before we are ready to do so your mission today has justified itself and yet i could almost wish that you had not left his #side#
hark a terrible scream a prolonged yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the #moor# that frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ had sprung to his feet and i saw his dark athletic outline at the #door# of the hut his shoulders stooping his #head# thrust forward his #face# peering into the darkness
oh my god i gasped what is it what does it mean hush he whispered hush
the cry had been loud on account of its vehemence but it had pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ whispered and i knew from the thrill of his voice that he the #man# of iron was shaken to the soul
now it burst upon our ears nearer louder more urgent than before where is it where is it $dr_watson$
there i think i pointed into the darkness no there again the agonized cry swept through the silent #night# louder and much nearer than ever
and a new sound mingled with it a deep muttered rumble musical and yet menacing rising and falling like the low constant murmur of the sea
the #hound# cried $mr_sherlock_holmes$ come $dr_watson$ come great heavens if we are too late he had started running swiftly over the #moor# and i had followed at his heels
but now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us there came #one# last despairing yell and then a dull heavy thud
we halted and listened not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless #night# i saw $mr_sherlock_holmes$ put his #hand# to his forehead like a #man# distracted
he stamped his feet upon the ground he has beaten us $dr_watson$ we are too late no no surely not
fool that i was to hold my #hand# and you $dr_watson$ see what comes of abandoning your charge but by heaven if the worst has happened we ll avenge him
blindly we ran through the gloom blundering against boulders forcing our #way# through gorse bushes panting up hills and rushing down slopes heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come
at every rise $mr_sherlock_holmes$ looked eagerly round him but the shadows were thick upon the #moor# and #nothing# moved upon its dreary #face#
can you see #anything# #nothing# but hark what is that a low moan had fallen upon our ears
there it was again upon our left on that #side# a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked a stone strewn slope
on its jagged #face# was spread eagled some dark irregular object as we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into a definite shape
it was a prostrate #man# #face# downward upon the ground the #head# doubled under him at a horrible angle the shoulders rounded and the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault
so grotesque was the attitude that i could not for the instant realize that that moan had been the passing of his soul
not a whisper not a rustle rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped $mr_sherlock_holmes$ laid his #hand# upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror
the gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim
there was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed suit the very #one# which he had worn on the first #morning# that we had seen him in baker street
we caught the #one# clear glimpse of it and then the match flickered and went out even as the hope had gone out of our souls
and it shone upon #something# else which turned our hearts sick and faint within us the body of #sir# $henry_baskerville$ $mr_sherlock_holmes$ groaned and his #face# glimmered white through the darkness
the brute the brute i cried with clenched #hand# oh $mr_sherlock_holmes$ i shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate
i am more to blame than you $dr_watson$ in order to have my #case# well rounded and complete i have thrown away the #life# of my client
but how could i know how could i know that he would risk his #life# alone upon the #moor# in the #face# of all my warnings
it is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career that we should have heard his screams my god those screams and yet have been unable to save him
where is this brute of a #hound# which drove him to his #death# it may be lurking among these rocks at this instant
uncle and nephew have been murdered the #one# frightened to #death# by the very sight of a beast which he thought to be supernatural the other driven to his end in his wild flight to escape from it
and $mr_stapleton$ where is he he shall answer for this deed he shall i will see to that but now we have to prove the connection between the #man# and the beast
save from what we heard we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter since #sir# $henry_baskerville$ has evidently died from the fall
we stood with bitter hearts on either #side# of the mangled body overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end
then as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor #friend# had fallen and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy #moor# half silver and half gloom
but by heavens cunning as he is the fellow shall be in my power before another #day# is past far away miles off in the direction of grimpen a single steady yellow #light# was shining
it could only come from the lonely abode of the stapletons with a bitter curse i shook my fist at it as i gazed
why should we not seize him at once our #case# is not complete the fellow is wary and cunning to the last degree
it is not what we know but what we can prove if we make #one# false move the villain may escape us yet
what can we do there will be plenty for us to do tomorrow tonight we can only perform the last offices to our poor #friend#
together we made our #way# down the precipitous slope and approached the body black and clear against the silvered stones
the agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my #eye# with tears we must send for help $mr_sherlock_holmes$
we cannot carry him all the #way# to the hall good heavens are you mad he had uttered a cry and bent over the body
now he was dancing and laughing and wringing my #hand# could this be my stern self contained #friend# these were hidden fires indeed
a beard a beard the #man# has a beard a beard it is not the #baronet# it is why it is my neighbour the convict
with feverish haste we had turned the body over and that dripping beard was pointing up to the cold clear moon
it was indeed the same #face# which had glared upon me in the #light# of the candle from over the rock the #face# of $selden$ the criminal
there could be no doubt about the beetling forehead the sunken animal #eye# then in an instant it was all clear to me
i remembered how the #baronet# had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to $mrs_barrymore$ barrymore had passed it on in order to help $selden$ in his escape
boots shirt cap it was all #sir# $henry_baskerville$ the tragedy was still black enough but this #man# had at least deserved #death# by the laws of his country
i told $mr_sherlock_holmes$ how the #matter# stood my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy then the clothes have been the poor devil #death# said he
it is clear enough that the #hound# has been laid on from some article of #sir# $henry_baskerville$ the boot which was abstracted in the hotel in all probability and so ran this #man# down
there is #one# very singular #thing# however how came $selden$ in the darkness to know that the #hound# was on his trail
to hear a #hound# upon the #moor# would not work a hard #man# like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming wildly for help
he heard him by his cries he must have run a long #way# after he knew the animal was on his track
how did he know a greater mystery to me is why this #hound# presuming that all our conjectures are correct i presume #nothing#
well then why this #hound# should be loose tonight i suppose that it does not always run loose upon the #moor#
my difficulty is the more formidable of the two for i think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours while mine may remain forever a mystery
$mr_stapleton$ would not let it go unless he had reason to think that #sir# $henry_baskerville$ would be there the question now is what shall we do with this poor wretch body
we cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens i suggest that we put it in #one# of the huts until we can communicate with the police
exactly i have no doubt that you and i could carry it so far halloa $dr_watson$ what this it the #man# himself by all that wonderful and audacious
not a #word# to show your suspicions not a #word# or my plans crumble to the ground a figure was approaching us over the #moor# and i saw the dull red glow of a cigar
the moon shone upon him and i could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist he stopped when he saw us and then came on again
you are the last #man# that i should have expected to see out on the #moor# at this #time# of #night#
why $dr_watson$ that not you is it but dear me what this somebody hurt not dont tell me that it is our #friend# #sir# $henry_baskerville$
he hurried past me and stooped over the dead #man# i heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers
who who this he stammered it is $selden$ the #man# who escaped from princetown $mr_stapleton$ turned a ghastly #face# upon us but by a supreme effort he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment
he looked sharply from $mr_sherlock_holmes$ to me dear me what a very shocking affair how did he die he appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks
my #friend# and i were strolling on the #moor# when we heard a cry i heard a cry also that was what brought me out
i was uneasy about #sir# $henry_baskerville$ why about #sir# $henry_baskerville$ in particular i could not help asking because i had suggested that he should come over
when he did not come i was surprised and i naturally became alarmed for his safety when i heard cries upon the #moor#
by the #way# his #eye# darted again from my #face# to $mr_sherlock_holmes$ did you hear #anything# else besides a cry no said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ did you
no what do you mean then oh you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom #hound# and so on
it is said to be heard at #night# upon the #moor# i was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight
we heard #nothing# of the kind said i and what is your theory of this poor fellow #death# i have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his #head#
he has rushed about the #moor# in a crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck that seems the most reasonable theory said $mr_stapleton$ and he gave a sigh which i took to indicate his relief
what do you think about it $mr_sherlock_holmes$ my #friend# bowed his compliments you are quick at identification said he
we have been expecting you in these parts since $dr_watson$ came down you are in #time# to see a tragedy
yes indeed i have no doubt that my #friend# explanation will cover the #fact# i will take an unpleasant remembrance back to london with me tomorrow
oh you return tomorrow that is my intention i hope your visit has cast some #light# upon those occurrences which have puzzled us
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ shrugged his shoulders #one# cannot always have the success for which #one# hopes an investigator needs #fact# and not legends or rumours
it has not been a satisfactory #case# my #friend# spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner $mr_stapleton$ still looked hard at him
i would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my $merripit_house$ but it would give my sister such a fright that i do not feel justified in doing it
then he turned to me i think that if we put #something# over his #face# he will be safe until #morning#
and so it was arranged resisting $mr_stapleton$ offer of hospitality $mr_sherlock_holmes$ and i set off to $henry_baskerville$ hall leaving the naturalist to return alone
looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad #moor# and behind him that #one# black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the #man# was lying who had come so horribly to his end
chapter fixing the nets we re at close grips at last said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ as we walked together across the #moor#
how he pulled himself together in the #face# of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that the wrong #man# had fallen a victim to his plot
i told you in london $dr_watson$ and i tell you now again that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel
what a nerve the fellow has i am sorry that he has seen you and so was i at first
but there was no getting out of it what effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here
like most clever criminals he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us
it may cause him to be more cautious or it may drive him to desperate measures at once why should we not arrest him at once
my dear $dr_watson$ you were born to be a #man# of action your instinct is always to do #something# energetic
but supposing for argument sake that we had him arrested tonight what on earth the better off should we be for that
if he were acting through a human agent we could get some evidence but if we were to drag this great dog to the #light# of #day# it would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master
we could prove #nothing# against him there the devilish cunning of it surely we have a #case# not a shadow of #one# only surmise and conjecture
we should be laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence there is #sir# $charles_baskerville$ #death#
you and i know that he died of sheer fright and we know also what frightened him but how are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it
found dead without a mark upon him what signs are there of a #hound# where are the marks of its fangs
of course we know that a #hound# does not bite a dead body and that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ was dead before ever the brute overtook him
but we have to prove all this and we are not in a position to do it well then tonight
we are not much better off tonight again there was no direct connection between the #hound# and the #man# #death# we never saw the #hound#
we heard it but we could not prove that it was running upon this #man# trail there is a complete absence of motive
no my dear fellow we must reconcile ourselves to the #fact# that we have no #case# at present and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish #one#
i have great hopes of what $mrs_laura_lyons$ may do for us when the position of affairs is made clear to her
sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof but i hope before the #day# is past to have the upper #hand# at last
and how do you propose to do so and i have my own plan as well i could draw #nothing# further from him and he walked lost in thought as far as the $henry_baskerville$ gates
are you coming up yes i see no reason for further concealment but #one# last #word# $dr_watson$ say #nothing# of the #hound# to #sir# $henry_baskerville$
he will have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow when he is engaged if i remember your report aright to dine with these people
let him think that $selden$ #death# was as $mr_stapleton$ would have us believe and so am i then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone
that will be easily arranged and now if we are too late for dinner i think that we are both ready for our suppers
#sir# $henry_baskerville$ was more pleased than surprised to see $mr_sherlock_holmes$ for he had for some #day# been expecting that recent events would bring him down from london
he did raise his eyebrows however when he found that my #friend# had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence
between us we soon supplied his wants and then over a belated supper we explained to the #baronet# as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should know
but first i had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to $mrs_barrymore$ and his #wife# to him it may have been an unmitigated relief but she wept bitterly in her apron
to all the world he was the #man# of violence half animal and half demon but to her he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood the child who had clung to her #hand#
evil indeed is the #man# who has not #one# #woman# to mourn him i ve been moping in the $merripit_house$ all #day# since $dr_watson$ went off in the #morning# said the #baronet#
if i hadnt sworn not to go about alone i might have had a more lively evening for i had a message from $mr_stapleton$ asking me over there
i guess i should have some credit for i have kept my promise i have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ drily
by the #way# i dont suppose you appreciate that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck
#sir# $henry_baskerville$ opened his #eye# how was that this poor wretch was dressed in your clothes i fear your servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the police
that lucky for him in #fact# it lucky for all of you since you are all on the wrong #side# of the law in this #matter#
that is unlikely there was no mark on any of them as far as i know i am not sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole household
$dr_watson$ reports are most incriminating documents but how about the #case# asked the #baronet# have you made #anything# out of the tangle
i dont know that $dr_watson$ and i are much the wiser since we came down i think that i shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long
it has been an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business there are several points upon which we still want #light# but it is coming all the same
we ve had #one# experience as $dr_watson$ has no doubt told you we heard the #hound# on the #moor# so i can swear that it is not all empty superstition
if you can muzzle that #one# and put him on a chain i ll be ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all #time#
i had #something# to do with dogs when i was out west and i know #one# when i hear #one# i think i will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me your help
whatever you tell me to do i will do very good and i will ask you also to do it blindly without always asking the reason
just as you like if you will do this i think the chances are that our little problem will soon be solved
the lamp beat upon his #face# and so intent was it and so still that it might have been that of a clear cut classical statue a personification of alertness and expectation
i have no doubt he stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my #head# into the air what is it
we both cried i could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal emotion his features were still composed but his #eye# shone with amused exultation
excuse the admiration of a connoisseur said he as he waved his #hand# towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall
$dr_watson$ wont allow that i know #anything# of art but that is mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ
now these are a really very fine series of portraits well i glad to hear you say so said #sir# $henry_baskerville$ glancing with some surprise at my #friend#
i dont pretend to know much about these #thing# and i be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture
i didnt know that you found #time# for such #thing# i know what is good when i see it and i see it now
that a kneller i ll swear that #lady# in the blue silk over yonder and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a reynolds
they are all #family# portraits i presume every #one# do you know the #name# $mrs_barrymore$ has been coaching me in them and i think i can say my lessons fairly well
who is the gentleman with the telescope that is rear admiral $henry_baskerville$ who served under rodney in the west indies
the #man# with the blue coat and the roll of paper is #sir# william $henry_baskerville$ who was chairman of committees of the $merripit_house$ of commons under pitt
and this cavalier opposite to me the #one# with the black velvet and the lace ah you have a right to know about him
that is the cause of all the mischief the wicked hugo who started the #hound# of the baskervilles we re not likely to forget him
dear me said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ he seems a quiet meek mannered #man# enough but i dare say that there was a lurking devil in his #eye#
i gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait i had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person
there no doubt about the authenticity for the #name# and the date are on the back of the canvas
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ said little more but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him and his #eye# were continually fixed upon it during supper
it was not until later when #sir# $henry_baskerville$ had gone to his #room# that i was able to follow the trend of his thoughts
he led me back into the banqueting hall his bedroom candle in his #hand# and he held it up against the #time# stained portrait on the wall
i looked at the broad plumed hat the curling love locks the white lace collar and the straight severe #face# which was framed between them
it was not a brutal countenance but it was prim hard and stern with a firm set thin lipped mouth and a coldly intolerant #eye#
do you see #anything# there is it like anyone you know there is #something# of #sir# $henry_baskerville$ about the jaw
he stood upon a chair and holding up the #light# in his left #hand# he curved his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets
just a suggestion perhaps but wait an instant good heavens i cried in amazement the #face# of $mr_stapleton$ had sprung out of the canvas
ha you see it now my #eye# have been trained to examine #face# and not their trimmings it is the first quality of a criminal investigator that he should see through a disguise
but this is marvellous it might be his portrait yes it is an interesting instance of a throwback which appears to be both physical and spiritual
a study of #family# portraits is enough to convert a #man# to the doctrine of reincarnation the fellow is a $henry_baskerville$ that is evident
with designs upon the succession exactly this chance of the picture has supplied us with #one# of our most obvious missing links
$dr_watson$ we have him and i dare swear that before tomorrow #night# he will be fluttering in our net as helpless as #one# of his own butterflies
we have him a pin a cork and a card and we add him to the baker street collection he burst into #one# of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture
i was up betimes in the #morning# but $mr_sherlock_holmes$ was afoot earlier still for i saw him as i dressed coming up the drive
i have not heard him laugh often and it has always boded ill to somebody yes we should have a full #day# today he remarked and he rubbed his #hand# with the joy of action
we ll know before the #day# is out whether we have caught our big leanjawed pike or whether he has got through the meshes
the nets are all in #place# and the drag is about to begin have you been on the #moor# already
i have sent a report from grimpen to princetown as to the #death# of $selden$ i think i can promise that none of you will be troubled in the #matter#
and i have also communicated with my faithful cartwright who would certainly have pined away at the #door# of my hut as a dog does at his master grave if i had not set his #mind# at rest about my safety
what is the next move to see #sir# $henry_baskerville$ ah here he is good #morning# $mr_sherlock_holmes$ said the #baronet#
you look like a general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff that is the exact situation
$dr_watson$ was asking for orders and so do i very good you are engaged as i understand to dine with our #friend# the stapletons tonight
i hope that you will come also they are very hospitable people and i am sure that they would be very glad to see you
i fear that $dr_watson$ and i must go to london to london yes i think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture
the #baronet# #face# perceptibly lengthened i hoped that you were going to see me through this business the hall and the #moor# are not very pleasant #place# when #one# is alone
you can tell your #friend# that we should have been happy to have come with you but that urgent business required us to be in town
my dear fellow you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what i tell you we hope very soon to return to devonshire
will you remember to give them that message if you insist upon it there is no alternative i assure you
i saw by the #baronet# clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he regarded as our desertion
we will drive in to $coombe_tracey$ but $dr_watson$ will leave his #thing# as a pledge that he will come back to you
when do you desire to go he asked coldly immediately after breakfast $dr_watson$ you will send a note to $mr_stapleton$ to tell him that you regret that you cannot come
i have a good #mind# to go to london with you said the #baronet# why should i stay here alone
because it is your post of duty because you gave me your #word# that you would do as you were told and i tell you to stay
all right then i ll stay #one# more direction i wish you to drive to $merripit_house$ send back your trap however and let them know that you intend to walk home
to walk across the #moor# yes but that is the very #thing# which you have so often cautioned me not to do
if i had not every confidence in your nerve and courage i would not suggest it but it is essential that you should do it
and as you value your #life# do not go across the #moor# in any direction save along the straight path which leads from $merripit_house$ to the grimpen road and is your natural #way# home
this #time# you may do it with safety then i will do it i will do just what you say
i should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possible so as to reach london in the afternoon
i was much astounded by this programme though i remembered that $mr_sherlock_holmes$ had said to $mr_stapleton$ on the #night# before that his visit would terminate next #day#
it had not crossed my #mind# however that he would wish me to go with him nor could i understand how we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to be critical
there was #nothing# for it however but implicit obedience so we bade good bye to our rueful #friend# and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of $coombe_tracey$ and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey
very good a small boy was waiting upon the platform any orders #sir# you will take this train to town cartwright
the moment you arrive you will send a wire to #sir# $henry_baskerville$ in my #name# to say that if he finds the pocketbook which i have dropped he is to send it by registered post to baker street
yes #sir# and ask at the station office if there is a message for me the boy returned with a telegram which $mr_sherlock_holmes$ handed to me
it ran wire received coming down with unsigned warrant arrive five forty lestrade that is in answer to mine of this #morning#
he is the best of the professionals i think and we may need his assistance now $dr_watson$ i think that we cannot employ our #time# better than by calling upon your acquaintance $mrs_laura_lyons$
he would use the #baronet# in order to convince the stapletons that we were really gone while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to be needed
his plan of campaign was beginning to be evident that telegram from london if mentioned by #sir# $henry_baskerville$ to the stapletons must remove the last suspicions from their #mind#
$mrs_laura_lyons$ was in her office and $mr_sherlock_holmes$ opened his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her
already i seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike i am investigating the circumstances which attended the #death# of the late #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ said he
my #friend# here $dr_watson$ has informed me of what you have communicated and also of what you have withheld in connection with that #matter#
what have i withheld she asked defiantly you have confessed that you asked #sir# $charles_baskerville$ to be at the gate at ten clock
we know that that was the #place# and hour of his #death# you have withheld what the connection is between these events
there is no connection in that #case# the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary #one# but i think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection after all
we regard this #case# as #one# of murder and the evidence may implicate not only your #friend# $mr_stapleton$ but his #wife# as well
i wish to be perfectly frank with you $mrs_laura_lyons$ the #lady# sprang from her chair his #wife# she cried
the #fact# is no longer a secret the person who has passed for his sister is really his #wife#
her #hand# were grasping the arms of her chair and i saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure of her grip
$mrs_laura_lyons$ had resumed her seat his #wife# she said again his #wife# he is not a married #man#
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ shrugged his shoulders prove it to me prove it to me and if you can do so
the fierce flash of her #eye# said more than any #word# i have come prepared to do so said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ drawing several papers from his pocket
it is indorsed mr and mrs vandeleur but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him and her also if you know her by sight
here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of mr and mrs vandeleur who at that #time# kept st oliver private school
here is a photograph of the couple taken in york four years ago read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people
she glanced at them and then looked up at us with the set rigid #face# of a desperate #woman#
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ she said this #man# had offered me marriage on condition that i could get a divorce from my husband
he has lied to me the villain in every conceivable #way# not #one# #word# of truth has he ever told me
and why why i imagined that all was for my own sake but now i see that i was never #anything# but a tool in his #hand#
why should i preserve faith with him who never kept any with me why should i try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts
ask me what you like and there is #nothing# which i shall hold back #one# #thing# i swear to you and
that is that when i wrote the #letter# i never dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman who had been my kindest #friend#
the recital of these events must be very painful to you and perhaps it will make it easier if i tell you what occurred and you can check me if i make any material mistake
i entirely believe you madam said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ the sending of this #letter# was suggested to you by $mr_stapleton$
i presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from #sir# $charles_baskerville$ for the legal expenses connected with your divorce
he dictated it exactly and then after you had sent the #letter# he dissuaded you from keeping the appointment
he told me that it would hurt his self respect that any other #man# should find the money for such an object and that though he was a poor #man# himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles which divided us
he appears to be a very consistent character and then you heard #nothing# until you read the reports of the #death# in the paper
he said that the #death# was a very mysterious #one# and that i should certainly be suspected if the #fact# came out
no and he made you swear to say #nothing# about your appointment with #sir# $charles_baskerville$ he did he frightened me into remaining silent
quite so but you had your suspicions she hesitated and looked down i knew him she said but if he had kept faith with me i should always have done so with him
i think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ you have had him in your power and he knew it and yet you are alive
we must wish you good #morning# now $mrs_laura_lyons$ and it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again
our #case# becomes rounded off and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ as we stood waiting for the arrival of the express from town
i shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative #one# of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern #time#
students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in godno in little russia in the year and of course there are the anderson murders in north carolina but this #case# possesses some features which are entirely its own
you have been walking for some months very near to the edge of a precipice even now we have no clear #case# against this very wily #man#
but i shall be very much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this #night#
the london express came roaring into the station and a small wiry bulldog of a #man# had sprung from a first class carriage
we all three shook #hand# and i saw at once from the reverential #way# in which lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the #day# when they had first worked together
i could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical #man#
#anything# good he asked the biggest #thing# for years said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ we have two hours before we need think of starting
i think we might employ it in getting some dinner and then lestrade we will take the london fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure #night# air of dartmoor
the #hound# of the baskervilles #one# of $mr_sherlock_holmes$ defects if indeed #one# may call it a defect was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment
partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him
never been there ah well i dont suppose you will forget your first visit chapter partly also from his professional caution which urged him never to take any chances
the result however was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants i had often suffered under it but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness
the great ordeal was in front of us at last we were about to make our final effort and yet $mr_sherlock_holmes$ had said #nothing# and i could only surmise what his course of action would be
my nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our #face# and the dark void spaces on either #side# of the narrow road told me that we were back upon the #moor# once again
our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired wagonette so that we were forced to talk of trivial #matter# when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation
it was a relief to me after that unnatural restraint when we at last passed $mr_frankland$ $merripit_house$ and knew that we were drawing near to the hall and to the scene of action
every stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure we did not drive up to the #door# but got down near the gate of the avenue
the wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to $coombe_tracey$ forthwith while we started to walk to $merripit_house$
as long as i have my trousers i have a hip pocket and as long as i have my hip pocket i have #something# in it
are you armed lestrade the little detective smiled good my #friend# and i are also ready for emergencies
my #word# it does not seem a very cheerful #place# said the detective with a shiver glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the grimpen mire
you re mighty close about this affair $mr_sherlock_holmes$ what the game now a waiting game
i see the #light# of a $merripit_house$ ahead of us that is $merripit_house$ and the end of our journey
we moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the $merripit_house$ but $mr_sherlock_holmes$ halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it
i must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper this will do said he
these rocks upon the right make an admirable screen we are to wait here yes we shall make our little ambush here
get into this hollow lestrade you have been inside the $merripit_house$ have you not $dr_watson$ can you tell the position of the #room#
what are those latticed #window# at this end i think they are the kitchen #window# and the #one# beyond which shines so brightly
that is certainly the dining #room# the blinds are up you know the lie of the land best creep forward quietly and see what they are doing but for heaven sake dont let them know that they are watched
i tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded the stunted orchard creeping in its shadow i reached a point whence i could look straight through the uncurtained #window#
there were only two #man# in the #room# #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and $mr_stapleton$ they sat with their profiles towards me on either #side# of the round table
both of them were smoking cigars and coffee and wine were in front of them $mr_stapleton$ was talking with animation but the #baronet# looked pale and distrait
as i watched them $mr_stapleton$ rose and left the #room# while #sir# $henry_baskerville$ filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair puffing at his cigar
perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill omened #moor# was weighing heavily upon his #mind# i heard the creak of a #door# and the crisp sound of boots upon gravel
the steps passed along the path on the other #side# of the wall under which i crouched looking over i saw the naturalist pause at the #door# of an out $merripit_house$ in the corner of the orchard
he was only a minute or so inside and then i heard the key turn once more and he passed me and reentered the $merripit_house$
i saw him rejoin his guest and i crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to tell them what i had seen
a key turned in a lock and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from within you say $dr_watson$ that the #lady# is not there
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ asked when i had finished my report no where can she be then since there is no #light# in any other #room# except the kitchen
i cannot think where she is i have said that over the great grimpen mire there hung a dense white fog
it was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a wall on that #side# of us low but thick and well defined
the moon shone on it and it looked like a great shimmering ice field with the #head# of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ #face# was turned towards it and he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift it moving towards us $dr_watson$
is that serious very serious indeed the #one# #thing# upon earth which could have disarranged my plans he cant be very long now
it is already ten clock our success and even his #life# may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path
the #night# was clear and fine above us the stars shone cold and bright while a half moon bathed the whole scene in a soft uncertain #light#
before us lay the dark bulk of the $merripit_house$ its serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver spangled sky
broad bars of golden #light# from the lower #window# stretched across the orchard and the #moor# #one# of them was suddenly shut off
there only remained the lamp in the dining #room# where the two #man# the murderous host and the unconscious guest still chatted over their cigars
the servants had left the kitchen every minute that white woolly plain which covered #one# half of the #moor# was drifting closer and closer to the $merripit_house$
the farther wall of the orchard was already invisible and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white vapour
as we watched it the fog wreaths came crawling round both corners of the $merripit_house$ and rolled slowly into #one# dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea
already the first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted #window# $mr_sherlock_holmes$ struck his #hand# passionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience
if he isnt out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered in half an hour we wont be able to see our #hand# in front of us
so as the fog bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half a mile from the $merripit_house$ and still that dense white sea with the moon silvering its upper edge swept slowly and inexorably on
shall we move farther back upon higher ground yes i think it would be as well we are going too far said $mr_sherlock_holmes$
we dare not take the chance of his being overtaken before he can reach us at all costs we must hold our ground where we are
he dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the ground thank god i think that i hear him coming
a sound of quick steps broke the silence of the #moor# crouching among the stones we stared intently at the silver tipped bank in front of us
the steps grew louder and through the fog as through a curtain there stepped the #man# whom we were awaiting he looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear starlit #night#
then he came swiftly along the path passed close to where we lay and went on up the long slope behind us
as he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder like a #man# who is ill at ease hist cried $mr_sherlock_holmes$ and i heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol
look out it coming there was a thin crisp continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of that crawling bank
the cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay and we glared at it all three uncertain what horror was about to break from the heart of it
i was at $mr_sherlock_holmes$ elbow and i glanced for an instant at his #face# it was pale and exultant his #eye# shining brightly in the moonlight
but suddenly they started forward in a rigid fixed stare and his lips parted in amazement at the same instant lestrade gave a yell of terror and threw himself #face# downward upon the ground
i sprang to my feet my inert #hand# grasping my pistol my #mind# paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog
fire burst from its open mouth its #eye# glowed with a smouldering glare its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame
never in the delirious dream of a disordered brain could #anything# more savage more appalling more hellish be conceived than that dark form and savage #face# which broke upon us out of the wall of fog
a #hound# it was an enormous coal black #hound# but not such a #hound# as mortal #eye# have ever seen with long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track following hard upon the footsteps of our #friend#
then $mr_sherlock_holmes$ and i both fired together and the creature gave a hideous howl which showed that #one# at least had hit him
so paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our nerve he did not pause however but bounded onward
far away on the path we saw #sir# $henry_baskerville$ looking back his #face# white in the moonlight his #hand# raised in horror glaring helplessly at the frightful #thing# which was hunting him down
but that cry of pain from the #hound# had blown all our fears to the winds if he was vulnerable he was mortal and if we could wound him we could kill him
never have i seen a #man# run as $mr_sherlock_holmes$ ran that #night# i am reckoned fleet of foot but he outpaced me as much as i outpaced the little professional
in front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after scream from #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and the deep roar of the #hound#
i was in #time# to see the beast spring upon its victim hurl him to the ground and worry at his throat
with a last howl of agony and a vicious snap in the air it rolled upon its back four feet pawing furiously and then fell limp upon its #side#
but the next instant $mr_sherlock_holmes$ had emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creature flank i stooped panting and pressed my pistol to the dreadful shimmering #head# but it was useless to press the trigger
we tore away his collar and $mr_sherlock_holmes$ breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in #time#
the giant #hound# was dead #sir# $henry_baskerville$ lay insensible where he had fallen already our #friend# eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move
lestrade thrust his brandy flask between the #baronet# teeth and two frightened #eye# were looking up at us my god he whispered
what was it what in heaven #name# was it it dead whatever it is said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ we ve laid the #family# ghost once and forever
it was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure mastiff but it appeared to be a combination of the two gaunt savage and as large as a small lioness
even now in the stillness of #death# the huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the small deep set cruel #eye# were ringed with fire
i placed my #hand# upon the glowing muzzle and as i held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the darkness
in mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying stretched before us phosphorus i said
a cunning preparation of it said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ sniffing at the dead animal there is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent
we owe you a deep apology #sir# $henry_baskerville$ for having exposed you to this fright i was prepared for a #hound# but not for such a creature as this
and the fog gave us little #time# to receive him you have saved my #life# having first endangered it are you strong enough to stand
give me another mouthful of that brandy and i shall be ready for #anything# so now if you will help me up
what do you propose to do to leave you here you are not fit for further adventures tonight if you will wait #one# or other of us will go back with you to the hall
he tried to stagger to his feet but he was still ghastly pale and trembling in every limb we helped him to a rock where he sat shivering with his #face# buried in his #hand#
we must leave you now said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ the rest of our work must be done and every moment is of importance
it a thousand to #one# against our finding him at the $merripit_house$ he continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path
we have our #case# and now we only want our #man# those shots must have told him that the game was up
we were some distance off and this fog may have deadened them he followed the #hound# to call him off of that you may be certain
the front #door# was open so we rushed in and hurried from #room# to #room# to the amazement of a doddering old manservant who met us in the passage
there was no #light# save in the dining #room# but $mr_sherlock_holmes$ caught up the lamp and left no corner of the $merripit_house$ unexplored
no no he gone by this #time# but we ll search the $merripit_house$ and make sure no sign could we see of the #man# whom we were chasing
on the upper floor however #one# of the bedroom #door# was locked there someone in here cried lestrade i can hear a movement
open this #door# a faint moaning and rustling came from within $mr_sherlock_holmes$ struck the #door# just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open
pistol in #hand# we all three rushed into the #room# but there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we expected to see
instead we were faced by an object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement
the #room# had been fashioned into a small museum and the walls were lined by a number of glass topped #case# full of that collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous #man#
in the centre of this #room# there was an upright beam which had been placed at some period as a support for the old worm eaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof
to this post a figure was tied so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to secure it that #one# could not for the moment tell whether it was that of a #man# or a #woman#
another covered the lower part of the #face# and over it two dark #eye# eyes full of grief and shame and a dreadful questioning stared back at us
in a minute we had torn off the gag unswathed the bonds and mrs $mr_stapleton$ sank upon the floor in front of us
#one# towel passed round the throat and was secured at the back of the pillar as her beautiful #head# fell upon her chest i saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck
the brute cried $mr_sherlock_holmes$ here lestrade your brandy bottle put her in the chair she has fainted from ill usage and exhaustion
she opened her #eye# again is he safe she asked has he escaped he cannot escape us madam
no no i did not mean my husband #sir# $henry_baskerville$ is he safe yes and the #hound# it is dead
she gave a long sigh of satisfaction thank god thank god oh this villain see how he has treated me
she shot her arms out from her sleeves and we saw with horror that they were all mottled with bruises
i could endure it all ill usage solitude a #life# of deception everything as long as i could still cling to the hope that i had his love but now i know that in this also i have been his dupe and his tool
but this is #nothing# nothing it is my #mind# and soul that he has tortured and defiled she broke into passionate sobbing as she spoke
you bear him no good will madam said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ tell us then where we shall find him if you have ever aided him in evil help us now and so atone
there is but #one# #place# where he can have fled she answered there is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire
it was there that he kept his #hound# and there also he had made preparations so that he might have a refuge
that is where he would fly the fog bank lay like white wool against the #window# $mr_sherlock_holmes$ held the lamp towards it
see said he no #one# could find his #way# into the grimpen mire tonight she laughed and clapped her #hand#
her #eye# and teeth gleamed with fierce merriment he may find his #way# in but never out she cried
how can he see the guiding wands tonight we planted them together he and i to mark the pathway through the mire
oh if i could only have plucked them out today then indeed you would have had him at your mercy
meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the $merripit_house$ while $mr_sherlock_holmes$ and i went back with the #baronet# to $henry_baskerville$ hall
the story of the stapletons could no longer be withheld from him but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the #woman# whom he had loved
but the shock of the #night# adventures had shattered his nerves and before #morning# he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of $dr_james_mortimer$
the two of them were destined to travel together round the world before #sir# $henry_baskerville$ had become once more the hale hearty #man# that he had been before he became master of that ill omened estate
and now i come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative in which i have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our #life# so long and ended in so tragic a manner
on the #morning# after the #death# of the #hound# the fog had lifted and we were guided by mrs $mr_stapleton$ to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog
it helped us to realize the horror of this #woman# #life# when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband track
it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted we left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog
from the end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the #way# to the stranger
rank reeds and lush slimy water plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our #face# while a false step plunged us more than once thigh deep into the dark quivering mire which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet
its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant #hand# was tugging us down into those obscene depths
so grim and purposeful was the clutch in which it held us once only we saw a trace that someone had passed that perilous #way# before us
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it and had we not been there to drag him out
from amid a tuft of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark #thing# was projecting he could never have set his foot upon firm land again
he held an old black boot in the air meyers toronto was printed on the leather inside it is worth a mud bath said he
it is our #friend# #sir# $henry_baskerville$ missing boot thrown there by $mr_stapleton$ in his flight exactly he retained it in his #hand# after using it to set the #hound# upon the track
he fled when he knew the game was up still clutching it and he hurled it away at this point of his flight
we know at least that he came so far in safety but more than that we were never destined to know though there was much which we might surmise
there was no chance of finding footsteps in the mire for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them
if the earth told a true story then $mr_stapleton$ never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled through the fog upon that last #night#
somewhere in the heart of the great grimpen mire down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in this cold and cruel hearted #man# is forever buried
but no slightest sign of them ever met our #eye# many traces we found of him in the bog girt island where he had hid his savage ally
beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp
in #one# of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined
a huge driving wheel and a shaft half filled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine a skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the debris
a dog said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ by jove a curly haired spaniel poor $dr_james_mortimer$ will never see his pet again well i do not know that this #place# contains any secret which we have not already fathomed
he could hide his #hound# but he could not hush its voice and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear
on an emergency he could keep the #hound# in the out $merripit_house$ at merripit but it was always a risk and it was only on the supreme #day# which he regarded as the end of all his efforts that he dared do it
it was suggested of course by the story of the #family# hell #hound# and by the desire to frighten old #sir# $charles_baskerville$ to #death#
no wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed even as our #friend# did and as we ourselves might have done when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the #moor# upon his track
it was a cunning device for apart from the chance of driving your victim to his #death# what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature
this paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed should he get sight of it as many have done upon the #moor#
i said it in london $dr_watson$ and i say it again now that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous #man# than he who is lying yonder he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the #moor#
it was the end of november and $mr_sherlock_holmes$ and i sat upon a raw and foggy #night# on either #side# of a blazing fire in our sitting #room# in baker street
since the tragic upshot of our visit to devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious conduct of colonel upwood in connection with the famous card scandal of the nonpareil club while in the second he had defended the unfortunate mme
chapter a retrospection montpensier from the charge of murder which hung over her in connection with the #death# of her step daughter mlle
carere the young #lady# who as it will be remembered was found six months later alive and married in new york
my #friend# was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended a succession of difficult and important #case# so that i was able to induce him to discuss the details of the $henry_baskerville$ mystery
i had waited patiently for the opportunity for i was aware that he would never permit #case# to overlap and that his clear and logical #mind# would not be drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past
#sir# $henry_baskerville$ and $dr_james_mortimer$ were however in london on their #way# to that long voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his shattered nerves
they had called upon us that very afternoon so that it was natural that the subject should come up for discussion
the whole course of events said $mr_sherlock_holmes$ from the point of view of the #man# who called himself $mr_stapleton$ was simple and direct although to us who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of the #fact# it all appeared exceedingly complex
i have had the advantage of two conversations with mrs $mr_stapleton$ and the #case# has now been so entirely cleared up that i am not aware that there is #anything# which has remained a secret to us
you will find a few notes upon the #matter# under the heading in my indexed list of #case#
perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from memory certainly though i cannot guarantee that i carry all the #fact# in my #mind#
the barrister who has his #case# at his fingers ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it all out of his #head# once more
intense mental concentration has a curious #way# of blotting out what has passed so each of my #case# displaces the last and mlle
tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair french #lady# and the infamous upwood
so far as the #case# of the #hound# goes however i will give you the course of events as nearly as i can and you will suggest #anything# which i may have forgotten
my inquiries show beyond all question that the #family# portrait did not lie and that this fellow was indeed a $henry_baskerville$
he was a son of that rodger $henry_baskerville$ the younger brother of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ who fled with a sinister reputation to south america where he was said to have died unmarried
he did as a #matter# of #fact# marry and had #one# child this fellow whose real #name# is the same as his father
he married beryl garcia #one# of the beauties of costa rica and having purloined a considerable sum of public money he changed his #name# to vandeleur and fled to england where he established a school in the east of yorkshire
his reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home and that he had used this #man# ability to make the undertaking a success
carere has blurred my recollection of $henry_baskerville$ hall fraser the tutor died however and the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy
the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their #name# to $mr_stapleton$ and he brought the remains of his fortune his schemes for the future and his taste for entomology to the south of england
i learned at the british museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject and that the #name# of vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had in his yorkshire #day# been the first to describe
we now come to that portion of his #life# which has proved to be of such intense interest to us
when he went to devonshire his plans were i believe exceedingly hazy but that he meant mischief from the first is evident from the #way# in which he took his #wife# with him in the character of his sister
the idea of using her as a decoy was clearly already in his #mind# though he may not have been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged
he meant in the end to have the estate and he was ready to use any tool or run any risk for that end
his first act was to establish himself as near to his ancestral home as he could and his second was to cultivate a friendship with #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ and with the neighbours
the fellow had evidently made inquiry and found that only two #life# intervened between him and a valuable estate the #baronet# himself told him about the #family# #hound# and so prepared the #way# for his own #death#
$mr_stapleton$ as i will continue to call him knew that the old #man# heart was weak and that a shock would kill him
so much he had learned from $dr_james_mortimer$ he had heard also that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously
his ingenious #mind# instantly suggested a #way# by which the #baronet# could be done to #death# and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt to the real murderer
having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with considerable finesse an ordinary schemer would have been content to work with a savage #hound#
the use of artificial means to make the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part the dog he bought in london from ross and mangles the dealers in fulham road
he brought it down by the north devon line and walked a great distance over the #moor# so as to get it home without exciting any remarks
he had already on his insect hunts learned to penetrate the grimpen mire and so had found a safe hiding #place# for the creature
it was the strongest and most savage in their possession here he kennelled it and waited his chance but it was some #time# coming
the old gentleman could not be decoyed outside of his grounds at #night# several #time# $mr_stapleton$ lurked about with his #hound# but without avail
it was during these fruitless quests that he or rather his ally was seen by peasants and that the legend of the demon dog received a new confirmation
she would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy
he had hoped that his #wife# might lure #sir# $charles_baskerville$ to his ruin but here she proved unexpectedly independent threats and even i am sorry to say blows refused to move her
he found a #way# out of his difficulties through the chance that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ who had conceived a friendship for him made him the minister of his charity in the #case# of this unfortunate #woman# $mrs_laura_lyons$
by representing himself as a single #man# he acquired complete influence over her and he gave her to understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her
his plans were suddenly brought to a #head# by his knowledge that #sir# $charles_baskerville$ was about to leave the hall on the advice of $dr_james_mortimer$ with whose opinion he himself pretended to coincide
she would have #nothing# to do with it and for a #time# $mr_stapleton$ was at a deadlock he must act at once or his victim might get beyond his power
he therefore put pressure upon $mrs_laura_lyons$ to write this #letter# imploring the old #man# to give her an interview on the evening before his departure for london
he then by a specious argument prevented her from going and so had the chance for which he had waited
driving back in the evening from $coombe_tracey$ he was in #time# to get his #hound# to treat it with his infernal paint and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman waiting
the dog incited by its master sprang over the wicket gate and pursued the unfortunate #baronet# who fled screaming down the yew alley
in that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge black creature with its flaming jaws and blazing #eye# bounding after its victim
the #hound# had kept upon the grassy border while the #baronet# had run down the path so that no track but the #man# was visible
on seeing him lying still the creature had probably approached to sniff at him but finding him dead had turned away again
he fell dead at the end of the alley from heart disease and terror it was then that it left the print which was actually observed by $dr_james_mortimer$
the #hound# was called off and hurried away to its lair in the grimpen mire and a mystery was left which puzzled the authorities alarmed the countryside and finally brought the #case# within the scope of our observation
you perceive the devilish cunning of it for really it would be almost impossible to make a #case# against the real murderer
his only accomplice was #one# who could never give him away and the grotesque inconceivable nature of the device only served to make it more effective
both of the #woman# concerned in the #case# mrs $mr_stapleton$ and $mrs_laura_lyons$ were left with a strong suspicion against $mr_stapleton$
so much for the #death# of #sir# $charles_baskerville$ $henry_baskerville$ mrs $mr_stapleton$ knew that he had designs upon the old #man# and also of the existence of the #hound#
$mrs_laura_lyons$ knew neither of these #thing# but had been impressed by the #death# occurring at the #time# of an uncancelled appointment which was only known to him
however both of them were under his influence and he had #nothing# to fear from them the first half of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult still remained
in any #case# he would very soon learn it from his #friend# $dr_james_mortimer$ and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of $henry_baskerville$
$mr_stapleton$ first idea was that this young stranger from canada might possibly be done to #death# in london without coming down to devonshire at all
he distrusted his #wife# ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old #man# and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her
it is possible that $mr_stapleton$ did not know of the existence of an heir in canada it was for this reason that he took her to london with him
they lodged i find at the mexborough private hotel in craven street which was actually #one# of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence
here he kept his #wife# imprisoned in her #room# while he disguised in a beard followed $dr_james_mortimer$ to baker street and afterwards to the station and to the northumberland hotel
his #wife# had some inkling of his plans but she had such a fear of her husband a fear founded upon brutal ill treatment that she dare not write to warn the #man# whom she knew to be in danger
eventually as we know she adopted the expedient of cutting out the #word# which would form the message and addressing the #letter# in a disguised #hand#
if the #letter# should fall into $mr_stapleton$ #hand# her own #life# would not be safe it reached the #baronet# and gave him the first warning of his danger
it was very essential for $mr_stapleton$ to get some article of #sir# $henry_baskerville$ attire so that in #case# he was driven to use the dog he might always have the means of setting him upon his track
with characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber maid of the hotel was well bribed to help him in his design
by chance however the first boot which was procured for him was a new #one# and therefore useless for his purpose
he then had it returned and obtained another a most instructive incident since it proved conclusively to my #mind# that we were dealing with a real #hound# as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot and this indifference to a new #one#
the more outre and grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined and the very point which appears to complicate a #case# is when duly considered and scientifically handled the #one# which is most likely to elucidate it
from his knowledge of our #room# and of my appearance as well as from his general conduct i am inclined to think that $mr_stapleton$ career of crime has been by no means limited to this single $henry_baskerville$ affair
it is suggestive that during the last three years there have been four considerable burglaries in the west country for none of which was any criminal ever arrested
the last of these at folkestone court in may was remarkable for the cold blooded pistolling of the page who surprised the masked and solitary burglar
i cannot doubt that $mr_stapleton$ recruited his waning resources in this fashion and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous #man#
we had an example of his readiness of resource that #morning# when he got away from us so successfully and also of his audacity in sending back my own #name# to me through the cabman
from that moment he understood that i had taken over the #case# in london and that therefore there was no chance for him there
then we had the visit from our #friend# next #morning# shadowed always by $mr_stapleton$ in the cab he returned to dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the #baronet#
#one# moment said i you have no doubt described the sequence of events correctly but there is #one# point which you have left unexplained
what became of the #hound# when its master was in london i have given some attention to this #matter# and it is undoubtedly of importance
there can be no question that $mr_stapleton$ had a confidant though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by sharing all his plans with him
his connection with the stapletons can be traced for several years as far back as the school mastering #day# so that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and #wife#
there was an old manservant at $merripit_house$ whose #name# was anthony this #man# has disappeared and has escaped from the country
it is suggestive that anthony is not a common #name# in england while antonio is so in all spanish or spanish american countries
the #man# like mrs $mr_stapleton$ herself spoke good english but with a curious lisping accent i have myself seen this old #man# cross the grimpen mire by the path which $mr_stapleton$ had marked out
it is very probable therefore that in the absence of his master it was he who cared for the #hound# though he may never have known the purpose for which the beast was used
the stapletons then went down to devonshire whither they were soon followed by #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and you #one# #word# now as to how i stood myself at that #time#
it may possibly recur to your memory that when i examined the paper upon which the printed #word# were fastened i made a close inspection for the water mark
in doing so i held it within a few inches of my #eye# and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine
there are seventy five perfumes which it is very necessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each other and #case# have more than once within my own experience depended upon their prompt recognition
the scent suggested the presence of a #lady# and already my thoughts began to turn towards the stapletons thus i had made certain of the #hound# and had guessed at the criminal before
it was evident however that i could not do this if i were with you since he would be keenly on his guard
ever we went to the west country it was my game to watch $mr_stapleton$ i deceived everybody therefore yourself included and i came down secretly when i was supposed to be in london
my hardships were not so great as you imagined though such trifling details must never interfere with the investigation of a #case#
i stayed for the most part at $coombe_tracey$ and only used the hut upon the #moor# when it was necessary to be near the scene of action
cartwright had come down with me and in his disguise as a country boy he was of great assistance to me
when i was watching $mr_stapleton$ cartwright was frequently watching you so that i was able to keep my #hand# upon all the strings
i was dependent upon him for food and clean linen i have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly being forwarded instantly from baker street to $coombe_tracey$
i was able to establish the identity of the #man# and the #woman# and knew at last exactly how i stood
the #case# had been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the relations between him and the barrymores
this also you cleared up in a very effective #way# though i had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations
by the #time# that you discovered me upon the #moor# i had a complete knowledge of the whole business but i had not a #case# which could go to a jury
even $mr_stapleton$ attempt upon #sir# $henry_baskerville$ that #night# which ended in the #death# of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving murder against our #man#
there seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red handed and to do so we had to use #sir# $henry_baskerville$ alone and apparently unprotected as a bait
we did so and at the cost of a severe shock to our client we succeeded in completing our #case# and driving $mr_stapleton$ to his destruction
that #sir# $henry_baskerville$ should have been exposed to this is i must confess a reproach to my management of the #case# but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing spectacle which the beast presented nor could we predict the fog which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice
we succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and $dr_james_mortimer$ assure me will be a temporary #one#
a long journey may enable our #friend# to recover not only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feelings
his love for the #lady# was deep and sincere and to him the saddest part of all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her
they were of great service to me and especially that #one# incidentally truthful piece of biography of $mr_stapleton$ it only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout
there can be no doubt that $mr_stapleton$ exercised an influence over her which may have been love or may have been fear or very possibly both since they are by no means incompatible emotions
at his command she consented to pass as his sister though he found the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder
she was ready to warn #sir# $henry_baskerville$ so far as she could without implicating her husband and again and again she tried to do so
$mr_stapleton$ himself seems to have been capable of jealousy and when he saw the #baronet# paying court to the #lady# even though it was part of his own plan still he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul which his self contained manner so cleverly concealed
by encouraging the intimacy he made it certain that #sir# $henry_baskerville$ would frequently come to $merripit_house$ and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desired
she had learned #something# of the #death# of the convict and she knew that the #hound# was being kept in the outhouse on the evening that #sir# $henry_baskerville$ was coming to dinner
she taxed her husband with his intended crime and a furious scene followed in which he showed her for the first #time# that she had a rival in his love
it was at least absolutely effective on the #day# of the crisis however his #wife# turned suddenly against him her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter hatred and he saw that she would betray him
he tied her up therefore that she might have no chance of warning #sir# $henry_baskerville$ and he hoped no doubt that when the whole countryside put down the #baronet# #death# to the curse of his #family# as they certainly would do he could win his #wife# back to accept an accomplished #fact# and to keep silent upon what she knew
in this i fancy that in any #case# he made a miscalculation and that if we had not been there his doom would none the less have been sealed
and now my dear $dr_watson$ without referring to my notes i cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious #case#
a #woman# of spanish blood does not condone such an injury so lightly i do not know that #anything# essential has been left unexplained
he could not hope to frighten #sir# $henry_baskerville$ to #death# as he had done the old uncle with his bogie #hound#
if its appearance did not frighten its victim to #death# at least it would paralyze the resistance which might be offered
if $mr_stapleton$ came into the succession how could he explain the #fact# that he the heir had been living unannounced under another #name# so close to the property
the beast was savage and half starved no doubt there only remains #one# difficulty how could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry
the past and the present are within the field of my inquiry but what a #man# may do in the future is a hard question to answer
it is a formidable difficulty and i fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it mrs $mr_stapleton$ has heard her husband discuss the problem on several occasions
he might claim the property from south america establish his identity before the british authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to england at all or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short #time# that he need be in london or again he might furnish an accomplice with the proofs and papers putting him in as heir and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income
there were three possible courses we cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some #way# out of the difficulty
and now my dear $dr_watson$ we have had some weeks of severe work and for #one# evening i think we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels
might i trouble you then to be ready in half an hour and we can stop at marcini for a little dinner on the #way#
