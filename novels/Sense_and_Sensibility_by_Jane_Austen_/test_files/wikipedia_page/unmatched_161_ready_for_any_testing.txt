jane austen wrote the first draft of the novel in the form of novel in letter epistolary form perhaps as early when she was about year old or at age and is said to have given it the title elinor and marianne_dashwood
austen drew inspiration for sense and sensibility from other novels of the that treated similar themes including adam stevenson life and love which he had written about himself and relationship that was not meant to be
jane west gossip story which features one sister full of rational sense and another sister of romantic emotive sensibility is considered to have been an inspiration as well
she later changed the form to narrative and the title to sense and sensibility west romantic sister heroine also shares her first name marianne_dashwood with austen
there are further textual similarities described in modern edition of west novel sense means good judgment wisdom or prudence and sensibility means sensitivity sympathy or emotionality
elinor is described as character with great sense although marianne_dashwood too is described as having sense and marianne_dashwood is identified as having great deal of sensibility although elinor too feels deeply without expressing it as openly
by changing the title austen added philosophical depth to what began as sketch of two characters sense and sensibility much like austen other fiction has attracted large body of criticism from many different critical approaches
early reviews of sense and sensibility focused on the novel as providing lessons in conduct which would be debated by many later critics as well as reviewing the characters
the norton critical edition of sense and sensibility edited by claudia johnson contains number of reprinted early reviews in its supplementary material
an unsigned review in the february critical review praises sense and sensibility as well written with well supported and drawn characters realistic and with highly pleasing plot in which the whole is just long enough to interest the reader without fatiguing
this review praises mrs marianne_dashwood the mother of the marianne_dashwood sister as well as elinor and claims that marianne_dashwood extreme sensibility makes her miserable
it claims that sense and sensibility has lesson and moral which is made clear through the plot and the characters another unsigned review from the may british critic further emphasizes the novel function as type of conduct book
the review claims that the object of the work is to represent the effects on the conduct of life of discreet quiet good sense on the one hand and an overrefined and excessive susceptibility on the other
the review states that sense and sensibility contains many sober and salutary maxims for the conduct of life within very pleasing and entertaining narrative
in this author opinion austen favoring of elinor temperament over marianne_dashwood provides the lesson f pollock review from frasier magazine titled british novelists becomes
in addition to emphasizing the novel morality pollock reviews the characters in catalogue like fashion praising and criticizing them in according to the notion that austen favors elinor point of view and temperament
pollock even praises sir mrs_john_dashwood lady_middleton and mrs_jennings even commenting on the humor of mr mrs_palmer and his silly wife
what editor claudia johnson terms an early example of what would become the customary view of sense and sensibility pollock criticizes sir mrs_john_dashwood marianne_dashwood selfishness without mentioning fanny influence upon them
an anonymous piece titled miss austen published in in the englishwoman domestic magazine departs from other early criticism in its sympathizing with marianne_dashwood over elinor claiming that elinor is too good character
the article also differs from other reviews in that it claims that the prevailing merit of the book is not in its sketch of the two sister rather the book is effective because of its excellent treatment of the subordinate characters
he also criticizes the steele sister for their vulgarity alice meynell article the classic novelist in the pall mall gazette also concurs with austen attention to small thing
meynell claims that austen deals in lesser characters and small matter because that which makes life art and work trivial is triviality of relations
in her attention to secondary characters meynell discusses the child function to illustrate the folly of their mother especially lady_middleton
austen biographer claire tomalin argues that sense and sensibility has wobble in its approach which developed because austen in the course of writing the novel gradually became less certain about whether sense or sensibility should triumph
austen characterises marianne_dashwood as sweet lady with attractive qualities intelligence musical talent frankness and the capacity to love deeply she also acknowledges that mrs_willoughby with all his faults continues to love and in some measure appreciate marianne_dashwood
the marianne_dashwood sister stand apart as being virtually the only characters capable of intelligent thought and any sort of deep thinking
brownstein wrote that the differences between the marianne_dashwood sister have been exaggerated and in fact the sister are more alike than they are different with elinor having excellent heart and capable of the same romantic passions as marianne_dashwood feels while marianne_dashwood has much sense as well
elinor is more reserved more polite and less impulsive than marianne_dashwood who loves poetry taking walks across picturesque landscapes and believes in intense romantic relationships but it is very closeness between the sister that allows these differences to emerge during their exchanges
for these reason some readers find marianne_dashwood ultimate marriage to colonel mrs_brandon an unsatisfactory ending many critics explore sense and sensibility in relation to authors and genres popular during austen time
this is style of writing in which all of the action dialogue and character interactions are reflected through letter sent from one or more of the characters
in her book romantic correspondence woman politics and the fiction of letter mary favret explores austen fraught relationship with epistolary fiction claiming that austen wrestled with epistolary form in previous writings and with the publication of sense and sensibility announced her victory over the constraints of the letter
favret contends that austen version of the letter separates her from her admired predecessor samuel richardson in that austen letter are a misleading guide to the human heart which in the best instances is always changing and adapting
according to favret with the character of elinor marianne_dashwood is an anti epistolary heroine whose inner world of thoughts and feeling does not find direct expression in the novel although her point of view controls the story
sense and sensibility establishes what favret calls new privacy in the novel which was constrained by previous notions of the romance of letter
this new privacy is less constraining mode of narration in which austen narrator provides commentary on the action rather than the characters themselves through the letter
one of the most popular forms of fiction in austen time was epistolary fiction favret claims that in sense and sensibility austen wants to recontextualize the letter and bring it into new realism
austen does so by imbuing the letter with dangerous power when marianne_dashwood writes to mrs_willoughby both their love and the letter prove false
when both of the sister write letter upon arriving in london elinor letter is the dutiful letter of the ensible sister and marianne_dashwood writes vaguely illicit letter reflecting her characterization as the sensitive sister
what is perhaps most striking about favret analysis is that she notes that the lovers who write to one another never unite with each other
a common theme of austen criticism has been on the legal aspects of society and the family particularly wills the rights of first and second sons and lines of inheritance
additionally favret claims that austen uses both of the sister letter writing to emphasize the contrasts in their personalities gene ruoff book jane austen sense and sensibility explores these issues in book length discussion of the novel
ruoff first two chapters deal extensively with the subject of wills and the discourse of inheritance these topics reveal what ruoff calls the cultural fixation on priority of male birth
according to ruoff male birth is by far the dominant issue in these legal conversations ruoff observes that within the linear family the order of male birth decides issues of eligibility and merit
when mr_robert_ferrars mr_edward_ferrars becomes the eldest son mr_edward_ferrars is no longer appealing to his opportunistic fiance miss_lucy_steele who quickly turns her attention to the foppish mr_robert_ferrars and entraps him in order to secure the inheritance for herself
according to ruoff miss_lucy_steele is specifically aiming for first son because of the monetary advantage for man in this birth order
william galperin in his book the history austen comments on the tendency of this system of patriarchal inheritance and earning as working to ensure the vulnerability of woman
because of this vulnerability galperin contends that sense and sensibility shows marriage as the only practical solution against the insecurity of remaining an unmarried woman
feminist critics have long been engaged in conversations about jane austen and sense and sensibility has figured in these discussions especially around the patriarchal system of inheritance and earning
sandra gilbert and susan gubar seminal feminist work the madwoman in the attic the woman writer and the nineteenth century imagination contains several discussions of sense and sensibility
gilbert and gubar read the beginning of sense and sensibility as retelling of king lear from female perspective and contend that these reversals imply that male traditions need to be evaluated and reinterpreted from female perspective
gilbert and gubar argue that austen explores the effects of patriarchal control on woman particularly in the spheres of employment and inheritance
in sense and sensibility they educe the fact that mr mrs_john_dashwood marianne_dashwood deprives his sister from their home as well as promised income as an instance of these effects
they also point to the despised mrs mr_edward_ferrars tampering with the patriarchal line of inheritance in her disowning of her eldest son mr_edward_ferrars as proof that this construction is ultimately arbitrary
gilbert and gubar contend that while sense and sensibility ultimate message is that young woman like marianne_dashwood and elinor must submit to powerful conventions of society by finding male protector woman such as mrs mr_edward_ferrars and miss_lucy_steele demonstrate how woman can themselves become agents of repression manipulators of conventions and survivors
in order to protect themselves and their own interests mrs mr_edward_ferrars and miss_lucy_steele must participate in the same patriarchal system that oppresses them
in the chapter sense and sensibility opinion too common and too dangerous from her book jane austen woman politics and the novel claudia johnson also gives feminist reading of sense and sensibility
she differs from previous critics especially the earliest one in her contention that sense and sensibility not as it is often assumed to be dramatized conduct book that values female prudence associated with elinor sense over female impetuosity associated with marianne_dashwood sensibility
rather johnson sees sense and sensibility as dark and disenchanted novel that views institutions of order such as property marriage and family in negative light an attitude that makes the novel the most attuned to social criticism of austen works
key to austen criticism of society per johnson argument is the depiction of the unfair marginalization of woman resulting from the death or simple absence of male protectors
according to johnson sense and sensibility critically examines the codes of propriety as well as their enforcement by the community additionally the male characters in sense and sensibility are depicted unfavorably
johnson calls the gentlemen in sense and sensibility uncommitted sorts who move on more or less unencumbered by human wreckage from the past
johnson compares mr_edward_ferrars to mrs_willoughby in this regard claiming that all of the differences between them as individuals do not hide the fact that their failures are actually identical johnson calls them both weak duplicitous and selfish lacking the honesty and forthrightness with which austen endows other exemplary gentlemen in her work
in other word the man do not feel responsibility to anyone else johnson comparison of mr_edward_ferrars and mrs_willoughby reveals the depressing picture about gentlemen presented in the novel
ideology as style in the works of mary wollstonecraft mary shelley and jane austen concurs with johnson on the dark tone of sense and sensibility
poovey contends that sense and sensibility has somber tone in which conflict breaks out between austen engagement with her self assertive characters and the moral codes necessary to control their potentially anarchic desires
austen shows according to poovey this conflict between individual desire and the restraint of moral principles through the character of elinor herself
mary poovey analysis in the proper lady and the woman writer except for elinor all of the female characters in sense and sensibility experience some kind of female excess
poovey argues that while austen does recognize the limitations of social institutions she demonstrates the necessity of controlling the dangerous excesses of female feeling rather than liberating them
she does so by demonstrating that elinor self denial especially in her keeping of miss_lucy_steele secret and willingness to help mr_edward_ferrars even though both of these actions were hurtful to her ultimately contribute to her own contentment and that of other
in this way poovey contends that austen suggests that the submission to society that elinor demonstrates is the proper way to achieve happiness in life
sense and sensibility criticism also includes ecocritical approaches susan rowland article the real work ecocritical alchemy and jane austen sense and sensibility studies the effects of alienation upon mr_edward_ferrars and mr_edward_ferrars
mr_edward_ferrars is alienated from society because he lacks what rowland calls useful employment according to rowland mr_edward_ferrars condition represents problems with the history of work in western industrialized societies
mr_edward_ferrars alienation from work also represents the culture evolution of work as progressive estrangement from nonhuman nature rowland argues that human culture estranges people from nature rather than returning them to it
marianne_dashwood also suffers from this estrangement of nature as she is ripped from her childhood home where she enjoyed walking the grounds and looking at trees
rowland thus connects both mr_edward_ferrars and marianne_dashwood progressive discomfort throughout the novel to their alienation from nature the three volumes of the first edition of sense and sensibility
in thomas egerton of the military library publishing house in london accepted the manuscript for publication in three volumes austen paid to have the book published and paid the publisher commission on sales
the cost of publication was more than third of austen annual household income of about in currency on the first edition which sold all printed copies by july
the novel has been in continuous publication through to the century as popular and critical appreciation of all the novels by jane austen slowly grew
a second edition was advertised in october the novel was translated into french by madame isabelle de montolieu as raison et sensibilité
montolieu had only the most basic knowledge of english and her translations were more of imitations of austen novels as montolieu had her assistants provide summary of austen novels which she then translated into an embellished french that often radically altered austen plots and characters
the translation of sense and sensibility by montolieu changes entire scenes and characters for example having marianne_dashwood call mrs_willoughby an angel and an adonis upon first meeting him lines that are not in the english original
likewise the scene where mrs marianne_dashwood criticizes her husband for planning to subsidise his widowed stepmother might be disadvantageous to our little harry mrs marianne_dashwood soon forgets about harry and it is made apparent her objections are founded in greed montolieu altered the scene by having mrs marianne_dashwood continuing to speak of our little harry as the basis of her objections completely changing her motives
when elinor learns the mr_edward_ferrars who married miss_lucy_steele is mr_robert_ferrars not mr_edward_ferrars montolieu adds in scene where mr_edward_ferrars the marianne_dashwood sister and their mother all break down in tears while clasping hand that was not in the original
austen has the marriage of mr_robert_ferrars mr_edward_ferrars and miss_lucy_steele end well while montolieu changes the marriage into failure this adaptation for bbc television was dramatized by denis constanduros and directed by david giles
