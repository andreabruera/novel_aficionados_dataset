their estate was large and their residence was at norland park in the centre of their property where for many generations they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance
the late owner of this estate was a single #man# who lived to a very advanced age and who for many years of his life had a constant companion and housekeeper in his #sister#
but her death which happened ten years before his own produced a great alteration in his home for to supply her loss he invited and received into his #house# the family of his nephew mr henry $marianne_dashwood$ the legal inheritor of the norland estate and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it
chapter the family of $marianne_dashwood$ had long been settled in sussex in the society of his nephew and niece and their children the old gentleman #day# were comfortably spent
the constant attention of mr and mrs henry $marianne_dashwood$ to his #wish# which proceeded not merely from interest but from goodness of heart gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence
his #attachment# to them all increased by a former marriage mr henry $marianne_dashwood$ had one son by his present #lady# three daughters
the son a steady respectable young #man# was amply provided for by the #fortune# of his #mother# which had been large and #half# of which devolved on him on his coming of age
to him therefore the succession to the norland estate was not so really important as to his #sister# for their #fortune# independent of what might arise to them from their #father# inheriting that property could be but small
their #mother# had #nothing# and their #father# only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal for the remaining moiety of his first wife #fortune# was also secured to her child and he had only a life interest in it
by his own marriage likewise which happened soon afterwards he added to his wealth the old gentleman died his #will# was read and like almost every other #will# gave as much disappointment as pleasure
he was neither so unjust nor so ungrateful as to leave his estate from his nephew but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed #half# the value of the bequest
mr $marianne_dashwood$ had wished for it more for the #sake# of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son but to his son and his son son a child of four years old it was secured in such a way as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate or by any sale of its valuable woods
the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child who in occasional visits with his #father# and #mother# at norland had so far gained on the affections of his #uncle# by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old an imperfect articulation an earnest desire of having his own way many cunning tricks and a great deal of noise as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which for years he had received from his niece and her daughters
he meant not to be unkind however and as a mark of his affection for the three girls he left them a thousand pounds a piece
mr $marianne_dashwood$ disappointment was at first severe but his temper was cheerful and sanguine and he might reasonably hope to live many years and by living economically lay by a considerable #sum# from the produce of an estate already large and capable of almost immediate improvement
he survived his #uncle# no longer and ten thousand pounds including the late legacies was all that remained for his widow and daughters
his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known and to him mr $marianne_dashwood$ recommended with all the strength and urgency which illness could command the interest of his #mother# in law and #sister#
mr $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a #time# and he promised to do every #thing# in his power to make them comfortable
his #father# was rendered easy by such an assurance and mr $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them
he was not an ill disposed young #man# unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill disposed but he was in general well respected for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary #duty#
had he married a more amiable woman he might have been made still more respectable than he was he might even have been made amiable himself for he was very young when he married and very fond of his wife
but the #fortune# which had been so tardy in coming was his only one twelvemonth but mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ was a strong caricature of himself more narrow minded and selfish
when he gave his promise to his #father# he meditated within himself to increase the #fortune# of his #sister# by the present of a thousand pounds a piece
the prospect of four thousand a year in addition to his present income besides the remaining #half# of his own #mother# #fortune# warmed his heart and made him feel capable of generosity
he then really thought himself equal to it yes he would give them three thousand pounds it would be liberal and handsome
it would be enough to make them completely easy three thousand pounds he could spare so considerable a #sum# with little
no sooner was his #father# funeral over than mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ without sending any notice of her intention to her #mother# in law arrived with her child and their attendants
no one could dispute her right to come the #house# was her husband from the moment of his #father# decease but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater and to a woman in mrs $marianne_dashwood$ situation with only common feelings must have been highly unpleasing but in her mind
there was a #sense# of honor so keen a generosity so romantic that any offence of the kind by whomsoever given or received was to her a source of immovable disgust
mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ had never been a favourite with any of her husband family but she had had no opportunity till the present of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it
so acutely did mrs $marianne_dashwood$ feel this ungracious behaviour and so earnestly did she despise her daughter in law for it that on the arrival of the latter she would have quitted the #house# for ever had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay and for their #sake# avoid a breach with their brother
$elinor$ this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possessed a strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which qualified her though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her #mother# and enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them all that eagerness of mind in mrs $marianne_dashwood$ which must generally have led to imprudence
inconvenience he thought of it all #day# long and for many #day# successively and he did not repent she had an excellent heart her disposition was affectionate and her feelings were strong but she knew how to govern them
it was a #knowledge# which her #mother# had yet to learn and which one of her #sister# had resolved never to be taught
$marianne_dashwood$ abilities were in many respects quite equal to $elinor$ she was sensible and clever but eager in everything her #sorrow# her joys could have no moderation
she was generous amiable interesting she was everything but prudent the resemblance between her and her #mother# was strikingly great $elinor$ saw with concern the excess of her #sister# sensibility but by mrs $marianne_dashwood$ it was valued and cherished
they encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction the agony of grief which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed was sought for was created again and again
they gave themselves up wholly to their #sorrow# seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future
she could consult with her brother could receive her #sister# in law on her arrival and treat her with proper attention and could strive to rouse her #mother# to similar exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance
$margaret$ the other #sister# was a good humored well disposed girl but as she had already imbibed a good deal of $marianne_dashwood$ romance without having much of her #sense# she did not at thirteen bid fair to equal her #sister# at a more advanced period of life
chapter mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ now installed herself mistress of norland and her #mother# and #sister# in law were degraded to the condition of #visitor#
as such however they were treated by her with quiet civility and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself his wife and their child
he really pressed them with some earnestness to consider norland as their home and as no plan appeared so eligible to mrs $marianne_dashwood$ as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a #house# in the neighbourhood his invitation was accepted
$elinor$ too was deeply afflicted but still she could struggle she could exert herself a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight was exactly what suited her mind
in seasons of cheerfulness no temper could be more cheerful than hers or possess in a greater degree that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself
but in #sorrow# she must be equally carried away by her fancy and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy
to take three thousand pounds from the #fortune# of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree
mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his #sister# she begged him to think again on the #subject#
how could he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child too of so large a #sum#
and what possible claim could the miss dashwoods who were related to him only by #half# blood which she considered as no relationship at all have on his generosity to so large an amount
it was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any #man# by different marriages and why was he to ruin himself and their poor little harry by giving away all his money to his #half# #sister#
it was my #father# last request to me replied her husband that i should assist his widow and daughters
he did not know what he was talking of i dare say ten to one but he was light headed at the #time#
had he been in his right #sense# he could not have thought of such a #thing# as begging you to give away #half# your #fortune# from your own child
he did not stipulate for any particular #sum# my dear $fanny$ he only requested me in general terms to assist them and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do
perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself he could hardly suppose i should neglect them
but as he required the promise i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at the #time#
the promise therefore was given and must be performed something must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home
well then let something be done for them but that something need not be three thousand pounds consider she added that when the money is once parted with it never can return
your #sister# #will# marry and it #will# be gone for ever if indeed it could be restored to our poor little boy
why to be sure said her husband very gravely that would make great difference the #time# may come when harry #will# regret that so large a #sum# was parted with
if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition to be sure it would
perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the #sum# were diminished one #half# five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their #fortune#
oh beyond anything great what brother on earth would do #half# so much for his #sister# even if really his #sister#
and as it is only #half# blood but you have such a generous spirit i would not #wish# to do any #thing# mean he replied
one had rather on such occasions do too much than too little no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more
there is no knowing what they may expect said the #lady# but we are not to think of their expectations the question is what you can afford to do
as it is without any addition of mine they #will# each have about three thousand pounds on their #mother# death a very comfortable #fortune# for any young woman
certainly and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds a piece to be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all
if they marry they #will# be sure of doing well and if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds
that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their #mother# while she lives rather than for them something of the annuity kind
they #will# have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them i mean my #sister# would feel the good effects of it as well as herself
a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable his wife hesitated a little however in giving her consent to this plan
to be sure said she it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once but then if mrs $marianne_dashwood$ should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in
certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty
an annuity is a very serious business it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it
fifteen years my dear $fanny$ her life cannot be worth #half# that purchase you are not aware of what you are doing
i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities for my #mother# was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my #father# #will# and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it
twice every year these annuities were to be paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such #thing#
her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more unkind in my #father# because otherwise the money would have been entirely at my #mother# disposal without any restriction whatever
it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world
my #mother# was quite sick of it it is certainly an unpleasant #thing# replied mr $marianne_dashwood$ to have those kind of yearly drains on one income
to be tied down to the regular payment of such a #sum# on every rent #day# is by no means desirable it takes away one independence
one #fortune# as your #mother# justly says is not one own undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it
they think themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises no gratitude at all if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely
i would not bind myself to allow them any #thing# yearly it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses
whatever i may give them occasionally #will# be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year
i believe you are right my love it #will# be better that there should be no annuity in the case it #will# certainly be much the best way
a present of fifty pounds now and then #will# prevent their ever being distressed for money and #will# i think be amply discharging my promise to my #father#
indeed to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your #father# had no idea of your giving them any money at all
the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small #house# for them helping them to move their #thing# and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they are in season
to be sure it #will# i ll lay my life that he meant #nothing# farther indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did
do but consider my dear mr $marianne_dashwood$ how excessively comfortable your #mother# in law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds a year a piece and of course they #will# pay their #mother# for their board out of it
altogether they #will# have five hundred a year amongst them and what on earth can four women want for more than that they #will# live so cheap
they #will# have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants they #will# keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind
i am sure i cannot imagine how they #will# spend #half# of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it
their housekeeping #will# be #nothing# at all only conceive how comfortable they #will# be five hundred a year they #will# be much more able to give you something
upon my word said mr $marianne_dashwood$ i believe you are perfectly right my #father# certainly could mean #nothing# more by his request to me than what you say
i clearly understand it now and i #will# strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described
when my #mother# removes into another #house# my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can
some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then certainly returned mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ but however one #thing# must be considered
when your #father# and #mother# moved to norland though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your #mother#
her #house# #will# therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it that is a material consideration undoubtedly
a valuable legacy indeed and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here
yes and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this #house# a great deal too handsome in my opinion for any place they can ever afford to live in
and i must say this that you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to his #wish# for we very well know that if he could he would have left almost everything in the world to them
it gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before and he finally resolved that it would be absolutely unnecessary if not highly indecorous to do more for the widow and children of his #father# than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out
chapter mrs $marianne_dashwood$ remained at norland several #month# not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while for when her spirits began to revive and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances she was impatient to be gone and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible
but she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter whose steadier judgment rejected several #house# as too large for their income which her #mother# would have approved
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections
she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself and she thought of it for her daughters #sake# with satisfaction though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than would support her in affluence
for their brother #sake# too for the #sake# of his own heart she rejoiced and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before in believing him incapable of generosity
his attentive behaviour to herself and his #sister# convinced her that their welfare was dear to him and for a long #time# she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions
the contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance felt for her daughter in law was very much increased by the farther #knowledge# of her character which #half# a year residence in her family afforded and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former the two #lady# might have found it impossible to have lived together so long had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility according to the opinions of mrs $marianne_dashwood$ to her daughters continuance at norland
this circumstance was a growing #attachment# between her eldest girl and the brother of mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ a gentleman like and pleasing young #man# who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his #sister# establishment at norland and who had since spent the greatest part of his #time# there
some #mother# might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest for $mr_edward_ferrars$ was the eldest son of a #man# who had died very rich and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence for except a trifling #sum# the whole of his #fortune# depended on the #will# of his #mother#
but however so it is your #father# thought only of them this argument was irresistible but mrs $marianne_dashwood$ was alike uninfluenced by either consideration
it was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable that he loved her daughter and that $elinor$ returned the partiality
it was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of #fortune# should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition and that $elinor$ merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her was to her comprehension impossible
$mr_edward_ferrars$ was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address he was not handsome and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing
he was too diffident to do justice to himself but when his natural shyness was overcome his behaviour gave every indication of an open affectionate heart
but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the #wish# of his #mother# and #sister# who longed to see him distinguished as they hardly knew what
his understanding was good and his education had given it solid improvement they wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other
his #mother# wished to interest him in political concerns to get him into parliament or to see him connected with some of the great #man# of the #day#
mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ wished it likewise but in the mean while till one of these superior blessings could be attained it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche
but $mr_edward_ferrars$ had no turn for great #man# or barouches all his #wish# centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life
$mr_edward_ferrars$ had been staying several weeks in the #house# before he engaged much of mrs $marianne_dashwood$ attention for she was at that #time# in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects
fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising she saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive and she liked him for it
she was first called to observe and approve him farther by a reflection which $elinor$ chanced one #day# to make on the difference between him and his #sister#
he did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill timed conversation it was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her #mother#
it is enough said she to say that he is unlike $fanny$ is enough it implies everything amiable i love him already
i think you #will# like him said $elinor$ when you know more of him like him replied her #mother# with a smile
i feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love you may esteem him i have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love
she speedily comprehended all his merits the persuasion of his regard for $elinor$ perhaps assisted her penetration but she really felt assured of his worth and even that quietness of manner which militated against all her established ideas of what a young #man# address ought to be was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate
no sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to $elinor$ than she considered their serious #attachment# as certain and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ now took pains to get acquainted with him her manners were attaching and soon banished his reserve
in a few #month# my dear $marianne_dashwood$ said she $elinor$ #will# in all probability be settled for life we shall miss her but she #will# be happy
oh mama how shall we do without her my love it #will# be scarcely a separation we shall live within a few miles of each other and shall meet every #day# of our lives
you #will# gain a brother a real affectionate brother i have the highest opinion in the world of $mr_edward_ferrars$ heart but you look grave $marianne_dashwood$ do you disapprove your #sister# choice
but yet he is not the kind of young #man# there is something wanting his figure is not striking it has none of that grace which i should expect in the #man# who could seriously attach my #sister#
perhaps said $marianne_dashwood$ i may consider it with some surprise $mr_edward_ferrars$ is very amiable and i love him tenderly his eyes want all that spirit that fire which at once announce virtue and intelligence
music seems scarcely to attract him and though he admires $elinor$ drawings very much it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth
it is evident in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws that in fact he knows #nothing# of the matter
and besides all this i am afraid mama he has no real taste he admires as a lover not as a connoisseur
to satisfy me those characters must be united i could not be happy with a #man# whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own
he must enter into all my feelings the same books the same music must charm us both oh mama how spiritless how tame was $mr_edward_ferrars$ manner in reading to us last night
i felt for my #sister# most severely yet she bore it with so much composure she seemed scarcely to notice it
i could hardly keep my seat to hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference
he would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose i thought so at the #time# but you would give him cowper
nay mama if he is not to be animated by cowper but we must allow for difference of taste $elinor$ has not my feelings and therefore she may overlook it and be happy with him
but it would have broke my heart had i loved him to hear him read with so little sensibility mama the more i know of the world the more am
i convinced that i shall never see a #man# whom i can really love i require so much he must have all $mr_edward_ferrars$ virtues and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm
remember my love that you are not seventeen it is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness
why should you be less fortunate than your #mother# in one circumstance only my $marianne_dashwood$ may your destiny be different from hers
chapter what a pity it is $elinor$ said $marianne_dashwood$ that $mr_edward_ferrars$ should have no taste for drawing no taste for drawing
he does not draw himself indeed but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people and i assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste though he has not had opportunities of improving it
replied $elinor$ why should you think so had he ever been in the way of learning i think he would have drawn very well
he distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste which in general direct him perfectly right
$marianne_dashwood$ was afraid of offending and said no more on the #subject# but the kind of approbation which $elinor$ described as excited in him by the drawings of other people was very far from that rapturous delight which in her opinion could alone be called taste
yet though smiling within herself at the mistake she honoured her #sister# for that blind partiality to $mr_edward_ferrars$ which produced it
indeed i think i may say that you cannot for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial and if that were your opinion i am sure you could never be civil to him
i hope $marianne_dashwood$ continued $elinor$ you do not consider him as deficient in general taste $marianne_dashwood$ hardly knew what to say
she would not wound the feelings of her #sister# on any account and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible
at length she replied do not be offended $elinor$ if my praise of him is not in every #thing# equal to your #sense# of his merits
i have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind his inclinations and tastes as you have but i have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and #sense#
i am sure replied $elinor$ with a smile that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that
i think him every #thing# that is worthy and amiable i do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly
of his #sense# and his goodness continued $elinor$ no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation
the excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent
$marianne_dashwood$ was rejoiced to find her #sister# so easily pleased you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth
he and i have been at #time# thrown a good deal together while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my #mother#
i have seen a great deal of him have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on #subject# of literature and taste and upon the whole i venture to pronounce that his mind is well informed enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and correct and his taste delicate and pure
but of his minuter propensities as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself his abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person
at first sight his address is certainly not striking and his person can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived
at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome or at least almost so what say you $marianne_dashwood$
when you tell me to love him as a brother i shall no more see imperfection in his face than i now do in his heart
i shall very soon think him handsome $elinor$ if i do not now $elinor$ started at this declaration and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into in speaking of him
she believed the regard to be mutual but she required greater certainty of it to make $marianne_dashwood$ conviction of their #attachment# agreeable to her
she knew that what $marianne_dashwood$ and her #mother# conjectured one moment they believed the next that with them to #wish# was to hope and to hope was to expect
she felt that $mr_edward_ferrars$ stood very high in her opinion she tried to explain the real state of the case to her #sister#
i do not attempt to deny said she that i think very highly of him that i greatly esteem that i like him
$marianne_dashwood$ here burst forth with indignation esteem him like him cold hearted $elinor$ oh worse than cold hearted ashamed of being otherwise
excuse me said she and be assured that i meant no offence to you by speaking in so quiet a way of my own feelings
believe them to be stronger than i have declared believe them in short to be such as his merit and the suspicion the hope of his affection for me may warrant without imprudence or folly
use those words again and i #will# leave the room this moment $elinor$ could not help laughing but farther than this you must not believe
there are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful and till his sentiments are fully known you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality by believing or calling it more than it is
i am by no means assured of his regard for me in my heart i feel little scarcely any doubt of his preference
what his #mother# really is we cannot know but from $fanny$ occasional mention of her conduct and opinions we have never been disposed to think her amiable and i am very much mistaken if $mr_edward_ferrars$ is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way if he were to #wish# to marry a woman who had not either a great #fortune# or high rank
but there are other points to be considered besides his inclination he is very far from being independent $marianne_dashwood$ was astonished to find how much the imagination of her #mother# and herself had outstripped the truth
and you really are not engaged to him said she yet it certainly soon #will# happen but two advantages #will# proceed from this delay
i shall not lose you so soon and $mr_edward_ferrars$ #will# have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity
oh if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself how delightful it would be
$elinor$ had given her real opinion to her #sister# she could not consider her partiality for $mr_edward_ferrars$ in so prosperous a state as $marianne_dashwood$ had believed it
there was at #time# a want of spirits about him which if it did not denote indifference spoke of something almost as unpromising
a doubt of her regard supposing him to feel it need not give him more than inquietude it would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him
she knew that his #mother# neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement
a more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection with such a #knowledge# as this it was impossible for $elinor$ to feel easy on the #subject#
she was far from depending on that result of his preference of her which her #mother# and #sister# still considered as certain
seemed the nature of his regard and sometimes for a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more than friendship
but whatever might really be its limits it was enough when perceived by his #sister# to make her uneasy and at the same #time# which was still more common to make her uncivil
she took the first opportunity of affronting her #mother# in law on the occasion talking to her so expressively of her brother great expectations of mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ resolution that both her sons should marry well and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to draw him in that mrs $marianne_dashwood$ could neither pretend to be unconscious nor endeavor to be calm
she gave her an answer which marked her contempt and instantly left the room resolving that whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal her beloved $elinor$ should not be exposed another week to such insinuations
in this state of her spirits a #letter# was delivered to her from the post which contained a proposal particularly well timed
it was the offer of a small #house# on very easy terms belonging to a relation of her own a gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire
nay the longer they were together the more doubtful the #letter# was from this gentleman himself and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation
he understood that she was in need of a dwelling and though the #house# he now offered her was merely a cottage he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary if the situation pleased her
he earnestly pressed her after giving the particulars of the #house# and garden to come with her daughters to $barton$ park the place of his own residence from whence
she might judge herself whether $barton$ cottage for the #house# were in the same parish could by any alteration be made comfortable to her
he seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his #letter# was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections
the situation of $barton$ in a county so far distant from sussex as devonshire which but a few hours before would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place was now its first recommendation
to quit the neighbourhood of norland was no longer an evil it was an object of desire it was a blessing in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter in law guest and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress
she instantly wrote sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ $lady_middleton$ her acknowledgment of his kindness and her acceptance of his proposal and then hastened to shew both #letter# to her daughters that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent
$elinor$ had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from norland than immediately amongst their present acquaintance
she needed no #time# for deliberation or inquiry her resolution was formed as she read on that head therefore it was not for her to oppose her #mother# intention of removing into devonshire
the #house# too as described by sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ was on so simple a scale and the rent so uncommonly moderate as to leave her no right of objection on either point and therefore though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy though it was a removal from the vicinity of norland beyond her #wish# she made no attempt to dissuade her #mother# from sending a #letter# of acquiescence
no sooner was her answer dispatched than mrs $marianne_dashwood$ indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son in law and his wife that she was provided with a #house# and should incommode them no longer than till every #thing# were ready for her inhabiting it
chapter they heard her with surprise mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ said #nothing# but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from norland
she had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into devonshire $mr_edward_ferrars$ turned hastily towards her on hearing this and in a voice of surprise and concern which required no explanation to her repeated devonshire
are you indeed going there so far from hence and to what part of it she explained the situation it was within four miles northward of exeter
a room or two can easily be added and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me i am sure i #will# find none in accommodating them
she concluded with a very kind invitation to mr and mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ to visit her at $barton$ and to $mr_edward_ferrars$ she gave one with still greater affection
though her late conversation with her daughter in law had made her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than was unavoidable it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended
to separate $mr_edward_ferrars$ and $elinor$ was as far from being her object as ever and she wished to show mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ by this pointed invitation to her brother how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match
mr $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ told his #mother# again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a #house# at such a distance from norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture
he really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his #father# was by this arrangement rendered impracticable
it is but a cottage she continued but i hope to see many of my friends in it the furniture was all sent around by water
mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ saw the packages depart with a sigh she could not help feeling it hard that as mrs $marianne_dashwood$ income would be so trifling in comparison with their own she should have any handsome article of furniture
it chiefly consisted of household linen plate china and books with a handsome pianoforte of $marianne_dashwood$ mrs $marianne_dashwood$ took the #house# for a twelvemonth it was ready furnished and she might have immediate possession
no difficulty arose on either side in the agreement and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at norland and to determine her future household before she set off for the west and this as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her was soon done the horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter
for the comfort of her children had she consulted only her own #wish# she would have kept it but the discretion of $elinor$ prevailed
her wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three two maids and a #man# with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at norland
the #man# and one of the maids were sent off immediately into devonshire to prepare the #house# for their mistress arrival for as $lady_middleton$ was entirely unknown to mrs $marianne_dashwood$ she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a #visitor# at $barton$ park and she relied so undoubtingly on sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ description of the #house# as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own
her eagerness to be gone from norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter in law in the prospect of her removal a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure
since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate their quitting his #house# might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment
but mrs $marianne_dashwood$ began shortly to give over every hope of the kind and to be convinced from the general drift of his discourse that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six #month# at norland
he so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping and of the perpetual demands upon his purse which a #man# of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away
in a very few weeks from the #day# which brought sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ $lady_middleton$ first #letter# to norland every #thing# was so far settled in their future abode as to enable mrs $marianne_dashwood$ and her daughters to begin their journey
now was the #time# when her son in law promise to his #father# might with particular propriety be fulfilled many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved
dear dear norland said $marianne_dashwood$ as she wandered alone before the #house# on the last evening of their being there when shall i cease to regret you when learn to feel a home elsewhere oh
happy #house# could you know what i suffer in now viewing you from this spot from whence perhaps i may view you no more and you ye
you #will# continue the same no leaf #will# decay because we are removed nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer no you #will# continue the same unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade but who #will# remain to enjoy you
well known trees but chapter the first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant
but as they drew towards the end of it their interest in the appearance of a country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection and a view of $barton$ valley as they entered
it gave them cheerfulness it was a pleasant fertile spot well wooded and rich in pasture after winding along it for more than a mile they reached their own #house#
a small green court was the whole of its demesne in front and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it
as a #house# $barton$ cottage though small was comfortable and compact but as a cottage it was defective for the building was regular the roof was tiled the window shutters were not painted green nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles
on each side of the entrance was a sitting room about sixteen feet square and beyond them were the offices and the stairs
a narrow passage led directly through the #house# into the garden behind four bed rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the #house#
in comparison of norland it was poor and small indeed but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the #house# were soon dried away
they were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival and each for the #sake# of the others resolved to appear happy
it was very early in september the season was fine and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation
high hills rose immediately behind and at no great distance on each side some of which were open downs the others cultivated and woody
it had not been built many years and was in good repair the situation of the #house# was good the village of $barton$ was chiefly on one of these hills and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows
the hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction under another name and in another course it branched out again between two of the steepest of them
with the size and furniture of the #house# mrs $marianne_dashwood$ was upon the whole well satisfied for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable yet to add and improve was a delight to her and she had at this #time# ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments
the prospect in front was more extensive it commanded the whole of the valley and reached into the country beyond
as for the #house# itself to be sure said she it is too small for our family but we #will# make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present as it is too late in the year for improvements
perhaps in the spring if i have plenty of money as i dare say i shall we may think about building
these parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often collected here and i have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance this with a new drawing room which may be easily added and a bed chamber and garret above #will# make it a very snug little cottage
i could #wish# the stairs were handsome but one must not expect every #thing# though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them
i shall see how much i am before hand with the world in the spring and we #will# plan our improvements accordingly
in the mean #time# till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a year by a woman who never saved in her life they were wise enough to be contented with the #house# as it was and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns and endeavoring by placing around them books and other possessions to form themselves a home
$marianne_dashwood$ pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of and $elinor$ drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room
in such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next #day# by the entrance of their landlord who called to welcome them to $barton$ and to offer them every accommodation from his own #house# and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient
sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ $lady_middleton$ was a good looking #man# about forty he had formerly visited at stanhill but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him
his countenance was thoroughly good humoured and his manners were as friendly as the style of his #letter# their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him
he said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family and pressed them so cordially to dine at $barton$ park every #day# till they were better settled at home that though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility they could not give offence
his kindness was not confined to words for within an hour after he left them a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park which was followed before the end of the #day# by a present of game
he insisted moreover on conveying all their #letter# to and from the post for them and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every #day#
$lady_middleton$ had sent a very civil message by him denoting her intention of waiting on mrs $marianne_dashwood$ as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite her ladyship was introduced to them the next #day#
they were of course very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at $barton$ must depend and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their #wish#
$lady_middleton$ was not more than six or seven and twenty her face was handsome her figure tall and striking and her address graceful
but they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration by shewing that though perfectly well bred she was reserved cold and had #nothing# to say for herself beyond the most common place inquiry or remark
conversation however was not wanted for sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ was very chatty and $lady_middleton$ had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child a fine little boy about six years old by which means there was one #subject# always to be recurred to by the #lady# in case of extremity for they had to enquire his name and age admire his beauty and ask him questions which his #mother# answered for him while he hung about her and held down his head to the great surprise of her ladyship who wondered at his being so shy before company as he could make noise enough at home
her manners had all the elegance which her husband wanted on every formal visit a child ought to be of the party by way of provision for discourse
in the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his #father# or #mother# and in what particular he resembled either for of course every body differed and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others
an opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children as sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ would not leave the #house# without securing their promise of dining at the park the next #day#
the #lady# had passed near it in their way along the valley but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill
chapter $barton$ park was about #half# a mile from the cottage the #house# was large and handsome and the $middletons$ lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance
they were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the #house# and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood
it was necessary to the happiness of both for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments unconnected with such as society produced within a very narrow compass
the former was for sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ gratification the latter for that of his #lady# sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ was a sportsman $lady_middleton$ a #mother#
$lady_middleton$ had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round while sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ independent employments were in existence only #half# the #time#
continual engagements at home and abroad however supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education supported the good spirits of sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife
$lady_middleton$ piqued herself upon the elegance of her table and of all her domestic arrangements and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties
but sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ satisfaction in society was much more real he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his #house# would hold and the noisier they were the better was he pleased
he was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young #lady# who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen
the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at $barton$
he hunted and shot and she humoured her children and these were their only resources the miss dashwoods were young pretty and unaffected
it was enough to secure his good opinion for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person
the friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those whose situation might be considered in comparison with the past as unfortunate
in showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart and in settling a family of females only in his cottage he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman for a sportsman though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ and her daughters were met at the door of the #house# by sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ who welcomed them to $barton$ park with unaffected sincerity and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young #lady# the concern which the same #subject# had drawn from him the #day# before at being unable to get any smart young #man# to meet them
they would see he said only one gentleman there besides himself a particular friend who was staying at the park but who was neither very young nor very gay
he hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party and could assure them it should never happen so again
he had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements
luckily $lady_middleton$ #mother# had arrived at $barton$ within the last hour and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman he hoped the young #lady# would not find it so very dull as they might imagine
the young #lady# as well as their #mother# were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party and wished for no more
$mrs_jennings$ $lady_middleton$ #mother# was a good humoured merry fat elderly woman who talked a great deal seemed very happy and rather vulgar
she was full of jokes and laughter and before dinner was over had said many witty #thing# on the #subject# of lovers and husbands hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not
$marianne_dashwood$ was vexed at it for her #sister# #sake# and turned her eyes towards $elinor$ to see how she bore these attacks with an earnestness which gave $elinor$ far more pain than could arise from such common place raillery as $mrs_jennings$
colonel $mrs_brandon$ the friend of sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend than $lady_middleton$ was to be his wife or $mrs_jennings$ to be $lady_middleton$ #mother#
his appearance however was not unpleasing in spite of his being in the opinion of $marianne_dashwood$ and $margaret$ an absolute old bachelor for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty but though his face was not handsome his countenance was sensible and his address was particularly gentlemanlike
there was #nothing# in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the dashwoods but the cold insipidity of $lady_middleton$ was so particularly repulsive that in comparison of it the gravity of colonel $mrs_brandon$ and even the boisterous mirth of sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ and his #mother# in law was interesting
$lady_middleton$ seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner who pulled her about tore her clothes and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves
the instrument was unlocked every body prepared to be charmed and $marianne_dashwood$ who sang very well at their request went through the chief of the songs which $lady_middleton$ had brought into the family on her marriage and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music although by her #mother# account she had played extremely well and by her own was very fond of it
he was silent and grave in the evening as $marianne_dashwood$ was discovered to be musical she was invited to play $marianne_dashwood$ performance was highly applauded
sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ was loud in his admiration at the end of every song and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted
$lady_middleton$ frequently called him to order wondered how any one attention could be diverted from music for a moment and asked $marianne_dashwood$ to sing a particular song which $marianne_dashwood$ had just finished
he paid her only the compliment of attention and she felt a respect for him on the occasion which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste
his pleasure in music though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others and she was reasonable enough to allow that a #man# of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment
colonel $mrs_brandon$ alone of all the party heard her without being in raptures she was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel advanced state of life which humanity required
she had only two daughters both of whom she had lived to see respectably married and she had now therefore #nothing# to do but to marry all the rest of the world
in the promotion of this object she was zealously active as far as her ability reached and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance
she was remarkably quick in the discovery of #attachment# and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young #lady# by insinuations of her power over such a young #man# and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at $barton$ decisively to pronounce that colonel $mrs_brandon$ was very much in love with $marianne_dashwood$
she rather suspected it to be so on the very first evening of their being together from his listening so attentively while she sang to them and when the visit was returned by the $middletons$ dining at the cottage the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again
chapter $mrs_jennings$ was a widow with an ample jointure it must be so she was perfectly convinced of it
$mrs_jennings$ had been anxious to see colonel $mrs_brandon$ well married ever since her connection with sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ first brought him to her #knowledge# and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl
it would be an excellent match for he was rich and she was handsome the immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both
to the former her raillery was probably as far as it regarded only himself perfectly indifferent but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible and when its object was understood she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity or censure its impertinence for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel advanced years and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ who could not think a #man# five years younger than herself so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter ventured to clear $mrs_jennings$ from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age
at the park she laughed at the colonel and in the cottage at $marianne_dashwood$ but at least mama you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation though you may not think it intentionally ill natured
colonel $mrs_brandon$ is certainly younger than $mrs_jennings$ but he is old enough to be my #father# and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have long outlived every sensation of the kind
it is too ridiculous when is a #man# to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity #will# not protect him
i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my #mother# but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs
infirmity said $elinor$ do you call colonel $mrs_brandon$ infirm did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life
my dearest child said her #mother# laughing at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty
i know very well that colonel $mrs_brandon$ is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature
mama you are not doing me justice he may live twenty years longer but thirty five has #nothing# to do with matrimony
but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty i should not think colonel $mrs_brandon$ being thirty five any objection to his marrying her
a woman of seven and twenty said $marianne_dashwood$ after pausing a moment can never hope to feel or inspire affection again and if her home be uncomfortable or her #fortune# small i can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the #sake# of the provision and security of a wife
perhaps said $elinor$ thirty five and seventeen had better not have any #thing# to do with matrimony together in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be #nothing# unsuitable
it would be a compact of convenience and the world would be satisfied in my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be #nothing#
to me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other
it would be impossible i know replied $elinor$ to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a #man# of thirty five anything near enough to love to make him a desirable companion to her
but i must object to your dooming colonel $mrs_brandon$ and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced to complain yesterday a very cold damp #day# of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders
but he talked of flannel waistcoats said $marianne_dashwood$ and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches cramps rheumatisms and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble
confess $marianne_dashwood$ is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek hollow eye and quick pulse of a fever
soon after this upon $elinor$ leaving the room mama said $marianne_dashwood$ i have an alarm on the #subject# of illness which i cannot conceal from you
had he been only in a violent fever you would not have despised him #half# so much i am sure $mr_edward_ferrars$ is not well
we have now been here almost a fortnight and yet he does not come #nothing# but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay
what else can detain him at norland had you any idea of his coming so soon said mrs $marianne_dashwood$ i had none
on the contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on the #subject# it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation when i talked of his coming to $barton$
i rather think you are mistaken for when i was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some #time#
does $elinor$ expect him already i have never mentioned it to her but of course she must how strange this is
what can be the meaning of it but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable how cold how composed were their last adieus
in $mr_edward_ferrars$ farewell there was no distinction between $elinor$ and me it was the good #wish# of an affectionate brother to both
twice did i leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning and each #time# did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room
how languid their conversation the last evening of their being together and $elinor$ in quitting norland and $mr_edward_ferrars$ cried not as i did
even now her self command is invariable when is she dejected or melancholy when does she try to avoid society or appear restless and dissatisfied in it
the #house# and the garden with all the objects surrounding them were now become familiar and the ordinary pursuits which had given to norland #half# its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than norland had been able to afford since the loss of their #father#
sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ $lady_middleton$ who called on them every #day# for the first fortnight and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed
their #visitor# except those from $barton$ park were not many for in spite of sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service the independence of mrs $marianne_dashwood$ spirit overcame the #wish# of society for her children and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk
chapter the dashwoods were now settled at $barton$ with tolerable comfort to themselves there were but few who could be so classed and it was not all of them that were attainable
about a mile and a #half# from the cottage along the narrow winding valley of allenham which issued from that of $barton$ as formerly described the girls had in one of their earliest walks discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which by reminding them a little of norland interested their imagination and made them #wish# to be better acquainted with it
but they learnt on enquiry that its possessor an elderly #lady# of very good character was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world and never stirred from home
the high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties and towards one of these hills did $marianne_dashwood$ and $margaret$ one memorable morning direct their steps attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding #day# had occasioned
the weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book in spite of $marianne_dashwood$ declaration that the #day# would be lastingly fair and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills and the two girls set off together
they gaily ascended the downs rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south westerly wind they pitied the fears which had prevented their #mother# and $elinor$ from sharing such delightful sensations
the whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks is there a felicity in the world said $marianne_dashwood$ superior to this $margaret$ we #will# walk here at least two hours
$margaret$ agreed and they pursued their way against the wind resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer when suddenly the clouds united over their heads and a driving rain set full in their face chagrined and surprised they were obliged though unwillingly to turn back for no shelter was nearer than their own #house#
one consolation however remained for them to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate
$marianne_dashwood$ had at first the advantage but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground and $margaret$ unable to stop herself to assist her was involuntarily hurried along and reached the bottom in safety
a gentleman carrying a gun with two pointers playing round him was passing up the hill and within a few yards of $marianne_dashwood$ when her accident happened
she had raised herself from the ground but her foot had been twisted in her fall and she was scarcely able to stand
the gentleman offered his services and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary took her up in his arms without farther delay and carried her down the hill
then passing through the garden the gate of which had been left open by $margaret$ he bore her directly into the #house# whither $margaret$ was just arrived and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour
$elinor$ and her #mother# rose up in amazement at their entrance and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person which was uncommonly handsome received additional charms from his voice and expression
had he been even old ugly and vulgar the gratitude and kindness of mrs $marianne_dashwood$ would have been secured by any act of attention to her child but the influence of youth beauty and elegance gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings
she thanked him again and again and with a sweetness of address which always attended her invited him to be seated
they set off he put down his gun and ran to her assistance but this he declined as he was dirty and wet
his name he replied was $mrs_willoughby$ and his present home was at allenham from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after miss $marianne_dashwood$
the honour was readily granted and he then departed to make himself still more interesting in the midst of a heavy rain
his manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration and the laugh which his gallantry raised against $marianne_dashwood$ received particular spirit from his exterior
attractions $marianne_dashwood$ herself had seen less of his mama the rest for the confusion which crimsoned over her face on his lifting her up had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the #house#
but she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others and with an energy which always adorned her praise
his person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story and in his carrying her into the #house# with so little previous formality there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her
his name was good his residence was in their favourite village and she soon found out that of all manly dresses
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ then begged to know to whom she was obliged every circumstance belonging to him was interesting a shooting jacket was the most becoming
sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors and $marianne_dashwood$ accident being related to him he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of $mrs_willoughby$ at allenham
her imagination was busy her reflections were pleasant and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded $mrs_willoughby$ cried sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ what is he in the country
that is good news however i #will# ride over tomorrow and ask him to dinner on thursday you know him then said mrs $marianne_dashwood$
know him to be sure i do why he is down here every year and what sort of a young #man# is he
as good a kind of fellow as ever lived i assure you a very decent shot and there is not a bolder rider in england
and is that all you can say for him cried $marianne_dashwood$ indignantly but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance
what his pursuits his talents and genius sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ was rather puzzled upon my soul said he i do not know much about him as to all that
but he is a pleasant good humoured fellow and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer i ever saw
but $marianne_dashwood$ could no more satisfy him as to the colour of mr $mrs_willoughby$ pointer than he could describe to her the shades of his mind
was she out with him today but who is he said $elinor$ where does he come from has he a #house# at allenham
on this point sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ could give more certain intelligence and he told them that mr $mrs_willoughby$ had no property of his own in the country that he resided there only while he was visiting the old #lady# at allenham court to whom he was related and whose possessions he was to inherit adding yes yes he is very well worth catching
i can tell you miss $marianne_dashwood$ he has a pretty little estate of his own in somersetshire besides and if i were you i would not give him up to my younger #sister# in spite of all this tumbling down hills
miss $marianne_dashwood$ must not expect to have all the #man# to herself $mrs_brandon$ #will# be jealous if she does not take care
i do not believe said mrs $marianne_dashwood$ with a good humoured smile that mr $mrs_willoughby$ #will# be incommoded by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what you call catching him
it is not an employment to which they have been brought up #man# are very safe with us let them be ever so rich
i am glad to find however from what you say that he is a respectable young #man# and one whose acquaintance #will# not be ineligible
i remember last christmas at a little hop at the park he danced from eight clock till four without once sitting down
he is as good a sort of fellow i believe as ever lived repeated sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ did he indeed cried $marianne_dashwood$ with sparkling eyes and with elegance with spirit
yes and he was up again at eight to ride to covert that is what i like that is what a young #man# ought to be
whatever be his pursuits his eagerness in them should know no moderation and leave him no #sense# of fatigue aye aye i see how it #will# be said sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ i see how it #will# be
you #will# be setting your cap at him now and never think of poor $mrs_brandon$ that is an expression sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ said $marianne_dashwood$ warmly which i particularly dislike
i abhor every common place phrase by which wit is intended and setting one cap at a #man# or making a conquest are the most odious of all
their tendency is gross and illiberal and if their construction could ever be deemed clever #time# has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity
sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ did not much understand this reproof but he laughed as heartily as if he did and then replied ay you #will# make conquests enough i dare say one way or other
poor $mrs_brandon$ he is quite smitten already and he is very well worth setting your cap at i can tell you in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles
$marianne_dashwood$ preserver as $margaret$ with more elegance than precision styled $mrs_willoughby$ called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries
he was received by mrs $marianne_dashwood$ with more than politeness with a kindness which sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ account of him and her own gratitude prompted and every #thing# that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the #sense# elegance mutual affection and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him
chapter of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced miss $marianne_dashwood$ had a delicate complexion regular features and a remarkably pretty figure
her form though not so correct as her #sister# in having the advantage of height was more striking and her face was so lovely that when in the common cant of praise she was called a beautiful girl truth was less violently outraged than usually happens
her skin was very brown but from its transparency her complexion was uncommonly brilliant her features were all good her smile was sweet and attractive and in her eyes which were very dark there was a life a spirit an eagerness which could hardily be seen without delight
$marianne_dashwood$ was still handsomer from $mrs_willoughby$ their expression was at first held back by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created
but when this passed away when her spirits became collected when she saw that to the perfect good breeding of the gentleman he united frankness and vivacity and above all when she heard him declare that of music and dancing
he was passionately fond she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay
it was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk she could not be silent when such points were introduced and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion
they speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either
encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions she proceeded to question him on the #subject# of books her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight that any young #man# of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works however disregarded before
the same books the same passages were idolized by each or if any difference appeared any objection arose it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed
he acquiesced in all her decisions caught all her enthusiasm and long before his visit concluded they conversed with the familiarity of a long established acquaintance
well $marianne_dashwood$ said $elinor$ as soon as he had left them for one morning i think you have done pretty well
you know what he thinks of cowper and scott you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper
their taste was strikingly alike you have already ascertained mr $mrs_willoughby$ opinion in almost every matter of importance but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such extraordinary despatch of every #subject# for discourse
another meeting #will# suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and then you can have #nothing# farther to ask $elinor$ cried $marianne_dashwood$ is this fair
you #will# soon have exhausted each favourite topic is this just are my ideas so scanty but i see what you mean
i have erred against every common place notion of decorum i have been open and sincere where i ought to have been reserved spiritless dull and deceitful
had i talked only of the weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have been spared
i have been too much at my ease too happy too frank my love said her #mother# you must not be offended with $elinor$ she was only in jest
i should scold her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend $marianne_dashwood$ was softened in a moment
$mrs_willoughby$ on his side gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance which an evident #wish# of improving it could offer
to enquire after $marianne_dashwood$ was at first his excuse but the encouragement of his reception to which every #day# gave greater kindness made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible by $marianne_dashwood$ perfect recovery
he came to them every #day# she was confined for some #day# to the #house# but never had any confinement been less irksome
he was exactly formed to engage $marianne_dashwood$ heart for with all this he joined not only a captivating person but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own and which recommended him to her affection beyond every #thing# else
$mrs_willoughby$ was a young #man# of good abilities quick imagination lively spirits and open affectionate manners his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment
they read they talked they sang together his musical talents were considerable and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which $mr_edward_ferrars$ had unfortunately wanted
in mrs $marianne_dashwood$ estimation he was as faultless as in $marianne_dashwood$ and $elinor$ saw #nothing# to censure in him but a propensity in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her #sister# of saying too much what he thought on every occasion without attention to persons or circumstances
in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety he displayed a want of caution which $elinor$ could not approve in spite of all that he and $marianne_dashwood$ could say in its support
$marianne_dashwood$ began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a #half# of ever seeing a #man# who could satisfy her ideas of perfection had been rash and unjustifiable
$mrs_willoughby$ was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period as capable of attaching her and his behaviour declared his #wish# to be in that respect as earnest as his abilities were strong
her #mother# too in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised by his prospect of riches was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such sons in law as $mr_edward_ferrars$ and $mrs_willoughby$
colonel $mrs_brandon$ partiality for $marianne_dashwood$ which had so early been discovered by his friends now first became perceptible to $elinor$ when it ceased to be noticed by them
their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility
$elinor$ was obliged though unwillingly to believe that the sentiments which $mrs_jennings$ had assigned him for her own satisfaction were now actually excited by her #sister# and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr $mrs_willoughby$ an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of colonel $mrs_brandon$
she saw it with concern for what could a silent #man# of five and thirty hope when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty
and as she could not even #wish# him successful she heartily wished him indifferent she liked him in spite of his gravity and reserve
his manners though serious were mild and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper
sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate #man# and she regarded him with respect and compassion
perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by $mrs_willoughby$ and $marianne_dashwood$ who prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young seemed resolved to undervalue his merits
$mrs_brandon$ is just the kind of #man# said $mrs_willoughby$ one #day# when they were talking of him together whom every body speaks well of and nobody cares about whom all are delighted to see and nobody remembers to talk to
she beheld in him an object of interest that is exactly what i think of him cried $marianne_dashwood$
he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him
that he is patronised by you replied $mrs_willoughby$ is certainly in his favour but as for the esteem of the others it is a reproach in itself
who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as $lady_middleton$ and $mrs_jennings$ that could command the indifference of any body else
but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and $marianne_dashwood$ #will# make amends for the regard of $lady_middleton$ and her #mother#
if their praise is censure your censure may be praise for they are not more undiscerning than you are prejudiced and unjust
do not boast of it however said $elinor$ for it is injustice in both of you in defence of your protege you can even be saucy
my protege as you call him is a sensible #man# and #sense# #will# always have attractions for me yes $marianne_dashwood$ even in a #man# between thirty and forty
i have found him capable of giving me much information on various #subject# and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good breeding and good nature
that is to say cried $marianne_dashwood$ contemptuously he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome
he has seen a great deal of the world has been abroad has read and has a thinking mind
he would have told me so i doubt not had i made any such inquiries but they happened to be points on which i had been previously informed
perhaps said $mrs_willoughby$ his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs gold mohrs and palanquins i may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further than your candour
i consider him on the contrary as a very respectable #man# who has every body good word and nobody notice who has more money than he can spend more #time# than he knows how to employ and two new coats every year
but why should you dislike him i do not dislike him add to which cried $marianne_dashwood$ that he has neither genius taste nor spirit
you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass replied $elinor$ and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid
i can only pronounce him to be a sensible #man# well bred well informed of gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart
that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice no expression miss $marianne_dashwood$ cried $mrs_willoughby$ you are now using me unkindly
you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason and to convince me against my #will# but it #will# not do you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful
i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel $mrs_brandon$ he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare
if it #will# be any satisfaction to you however to be told that i believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable i am ready to confess it
and in return for an acknowledgment which must give me some pain you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever
little had mrs $marianne_dashwood$ or her daughters imagined when they first came into devonshire that so many engagements would arise to occupy their #time# as shortly presented themselves or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant #visitor# as to leave them little leisure for serious employment
when $marianne_dashwood$ was recovered the schemes of amusement at home and abroad which sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ had been previously forming were put into execution
the private balls at the park then began and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery october would allow
in every meeting of the kind $mrs_willoughby$ was included and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of $marianne_dashwood$ of marking his animated admiration of her and of receiving in her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance of her affection
she only wished that it were less openly shewn and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self command to $marianne_dashwood$
but $marianne_dashwood$ abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common place and mistaken notions
chapter yet such was the case $elinor$ could not be surprised at their #attachment# $mrs_willoughby$ thought the same and their behaviour at all #time# was an illustration of their opinions
when he was present she had no eyes for any one else every #thing# he did was right every #thing# he said was clever
if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand
if dancing formed the amusement of the night they were partners for #half# the #time# and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else
such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at but ridicule could not shame and seemed hardly to provoke them
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them
to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind this was the season of happiness to $marianne_dashwood$
her heart was devoted to $mrs_willoughby$ and the fond #attachment# to norland which she brought with her from sussex was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home
$elinor$ happiness was not so great her heart was not so much at ease nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure
they afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret than ever
neither $lady_middleton$ nor $mrs_jennings$ could supply to her the conversation she missed although the latter was an everlasting talker and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse
she had already repeated her own history to $elinor$ three or four #time# and had $elinor$ memory been equal to her means of improvement she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of mr jennings last illness and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died
$elinor$ needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which #sense# had #nothing# to do
towards her husband and #mother# she was the same as to them and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired
$lady_middleton$ was more agreeable than her #mother# only in being more silent she had #nothing# to say one #day# that she had not said the #day# before
her insipidity was invariable for even her spirits were always the same and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided every #thing# were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home and
so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others by any share in their conversation that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys
in colonel $mrs_brandon$ alone of all her new acquaintance did $elinor$ find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities excite the interest of friendship or give pleasure as a companion
her admiration and regard even her sisterly regard was all his own but he was a lover his attentions were wholly $marianne_dashwood$ and a far less agreeable #man# might have been more generally pleasing
colonel $mrs_brandon$ unfortunately for himself had no such encouragement to think only of $marianne_dashwood$ and in conversing with $elinor$ he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her #sister#
$elinor$ compassion for him increased as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him
this suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from him one evening at the park when they were sitting down together by mutual consent while the others were dancing
his eyes were fixed on $marianne_dashwood$ and after a silence of some minutes he said with a faint smile your #sister# i understand does not approve of second #attachment#
$mrs_willoughby$ was out of the question no replied $elinor$ her opinions are all romantic or rather as i believe she considers them impossible to exist
but how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own #father# who had himself two wives i know not
a few years however #will# settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common #sense# and observation and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are by any body but herself
this #will# probably be the case he replied and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions
there are inconveniences attending such feelings as $marianne_dashwood$ which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for
her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage
i believe she does i cannot agree with you there said $elinor$ after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying
does your #sister# make no distinction in her objections against a second #attachment# or is it equally criminal in every body
are those who have been disappointed in their first choice whether from the inconstancy of its object or the perverseness of circumstances to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives
upon my word i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second #attachment# being pardonable
no no do not desire it for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common and too dangerous
i once knew a #lady# who in temper and mind greatly resembled your #sister# who thought and judged like her but who from an inforced change from a series of unfortunate circumstances
here he stopt suddenly appeared to think that he had said too much and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures which might not otherwise have entered $elinor$ head
the #lady# would probably have passed without suspicion had he not convinced miss $marianne_dashwood$ that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips
as it was it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard
this said he cannot hold but a change a total change of sentiments i speak from experience $elinor$ attempted no more
the whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination and every #thing# established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love
chapter as $elinor$ and $marianne_dashwood$ were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her #sister# which in spite of all that she knew before of $marianne_dashwood$ imprudence and want of thought surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both
$marianne_dashwood$ told her with the greatest delight that $mrs_willoughby$ had given her a horse one that he had bred himself on his estate in somersetshire and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman
without considering that it was not in her #mother# plan to keep any horse that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift she must buy another for the servant and keep a servant to ride it and after all build a stable to receive them she had accepted the present without hesitation and told her #sister# of it in raptures
he intends to send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it she added and when it arrives we #will# ride every #day#
but $marianne_dashwood$ in her place would not have done so little you shall share its use with me imagine to yourself my dear $elinor$ the delight of a gallop on some of these downs
most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair and for some #time# she refused to submit to them
as to an additional servant the expense would be a trifle mama she was sure would never object to it and any horse would do for him he might always get one at the park as to a stable the merest shed would be sufficient
$elinor$ then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a #man# so little or at least so lately known to her
this was too much you are mistaken $elinor$ said she warmly in supposing i know very little of $mrs_willoughby$
i have not known him long indeed but i am much better acquainted with him than i am with any other creature in the world except yourself and mama
seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven #day# are more than enough for others
it is not #time# or opportunity that is to determine intimacy it is disposition alone i should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother than from $mrs_willoughby$
of $mrs_john_dashwood$ i know very little though we have lived together for years but of $mrs_willoughby$ my judgment has long been formed
$elinor$ thought it wisest to touch that point no more she knew her #sister# temper opposition on so tender a #subject# would only attach her the more to her own opinion
but by an appeal to her affection for her #mother# by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent #mother# must draw on herself if as would probably be the case she consented to this increase of establishment $marianne_dashwood$ was shortly subdued and she promised not to tempt her #mother# to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer and to tell $mrs_willoughby$ when she saw him next that it must be declined
she was faithful to her word and when $mrs_willoughby$ called at the cottage the same #day# $elinor$ heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present
the reasons for this alteration were at the same #time# related and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible
his concern however was very apparent and after expressing it with earnestness he added in the same low voice but $marianne_dashwood$ the horse is still yours though you cannot use it now
i shall keep it only till you can claim it when you leave $barton$ to form your own establishment in a more lasting home queen mab shall receive you
this was all overheard by miss $marianne_dashwood$ and in the whole of the sentence in his manner of pronouncing it and in his addressing her #sister# by her christian name alone she instantly saw an intimacy so decided a meaning so direct as marked a perfect agreement between them
from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she or any of their friends should be left by tempers so frank to discover it by accident
$mrs_willoughby$ had spent the preceding evening with them and $margaret$ by being left some #time# in the parlour with only him and $marianne_dashwood$ had had opportunity for observations which with a most important face she communicated to her eldest #sister# when they were next by themselves
$margaret$ related something to her the next #day# which placed this matter in a still clearer light oh $elinor$
she cried i have such a secret to tell you about $marianne_dashwood$ i am sure she #will# be married to mr $mrs_willoughby$ very soon
you have said so replied $elinor$ almost every #day# since they first met on high church down and they had not known each other a week i believe before you were certain that $marianne_dashwood$ wore his picture round her neck but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great #uncle#
but indeed this is quite another #thing# i am sure they #will# be married very soon for he has got a lock of her hair
take care $margaret$ it may be only the hair of some great #uncle# of his but indeed $elinor$ it is $marianne_dashwood$
last night after tea when you and mama went out of the room they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be and he seemed to be begging something of her and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair for it was all tumbled down her back and he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of white paper and put it into his pocket book
for such particulars stated on such authority $elinor$ could not withhold her credit nor was she disposed to it for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself
i am almost sure it is for i saw him cut it off $margaret$ sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her #sister#
when $mrs_jennings$ attacked her one evening at the park to give the name of the young #man# who was $elinor$ particular favourite which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her $margaret$ answered by looking at her #sister# and saying i must not tell may i $elinor$
she was convinced that $margaret$ had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with $mrs_jennings$
$marianne_dashwood$ felt for her most sincerely but she did more harm than good to the cause by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to $margaret$ remember that whatever your conjectures may be you have no right to repeat them
this of course made every body laugh and $elinor$ tried to laugh too but the effort was painful i never had any conjectures about it replied $margaret$ it was you who told me of it yourself
this increased the mirth of the company and $margaret$ was eagerly pressed to say something more oh pray miss $margaret$ let us know all about it said $mrs_jennings$
what is the gentleman name i must not tell ma am but i know very well what it is and i know where he is too
yes yes we can guess where he is at his own #house# at norland to be sure he is the curate of the parish i dare say
$margaret$ said $marianne_dashwood$ with great warmth you know that all this is an invention of your own and that there is no such person in existence
well then he is lately dead $marianne_dashwood$ for i am sure there was such a #man# once and his name begins with an
most grateful did $elinor$ feel to $lady_middleton$ for observing at this moment that it rained very hard though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her than from her ladyship great dislike of all such inelegant #subject# of raillery as delighted her husband and #mother#
the idea however started by her was immediately pursued by colonel $mrs_brandon$ who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others and much was said on the #subject# of rain by both of them
$mrs_willoughby$ opened the piano forte and asked $marianne_dashwood$ to sit down to it and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic it fell to the ground
no that he is not he is of no profession at all but not so easily did $elinor$ recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her
a party was formed this evening for going on the following #day# to see a very fine place about twelve miles from $barton$ belonging to a brother in law of colonel $mrs_brandon$ without whose interest it could not be seen as the proprietor who was then abroad had left strict orders on that head
the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful and sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ who was particularly warm in their praise might be allowed to be a tolerable judge for he had formed parties to visit them at least twice every summer for the last ten years
they contained a noble piece of water a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning amusement cold provisions were to be taken open carriages only to be employed and every #thing# conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure
to some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking considering the #time# of year and that it had rained every #day# for the last fortnight and mrs $marianne_dashwood$ who had already a cold was persuaded by $elinor$ to stay at home
she was prepared to be wet through fatigued and frightened but the event was still more unfortunate for they did not go at all
chapter their intended excursion to whitwell turned out very different from what $elinor$ had expected by ten clock the whole party was assembled at the park where they were to breakfast
the morning was rather favourable though it had rained all night as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky and the sun frequently appeared
they were all in high spirits and good humour eager to be happy and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise
while they were at breakfast the #letter# were brought in among the rest there was one for colonel $mrs_brandon$ he took it looked at the direction changed colour and immediately left the room
what is the matter with $mrs_brandon$ said sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ nobody could tell i hope he has had no bad news said $lady_middleton$
it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel $mrs_brandon$ leave my breakfast table so suddenly in about five minutes he returned
no bad news colonel i hope said $mrs_jennings$ as soon as he entered the room none at all ma am i thank you
was it from avignon i hope it is not to say that your #sister# is worse no ma am it came from town and is merely a #letter# of business
but how came the hand to discompose you so much if it was only a #letter# of business come come this wont do colonel so let us hear the truth of it
perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin $fanny$ is married said $mrs_jennings$ without attending to her daughter reproof
my dear madam said $lady_middleton$ recollect what you are saying no indeed it is not
well then i know who it is from colonel and i hope she is well whom do you mean ma am said he colouring a little
i am particularly sorry ma am said he addressing $lady_middleton$ that i should receive this #letter# today for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town
oh you know who i mean in town cried $mrs_jennings$ what can you have to do in town at this #time# of year
my own loss is great he continued in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party but i am the more concerned as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at whitwell
what a blow upon them all was this but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr $mrs_brandon$ said $marianne_dashwood$ eagerly #will# it not be sufficient
he shook his head we must go said sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ it shall not be put off when we are so near it
you cannot go to town till tomorrow $mrs_brandon$ that is all i #wish# it could be so easily settled but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one #day#
if you would but let us know what your business is said $mrs_jennings$ we might see whether it could be put off or not
you would not be six hours later said $mrs_willoughby$ if you were to defer your journey till our return
then heard $mrs_willoughby$ say in a low voice to $marianne_dashwood$ there are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure
i cannot afford to lose one hour $elinor$ $mrs_brandon$ is one of them he was afraid of catching cold i dare say and invented this trick for getting out of it
i would lay fifty guineas the #letter# was of his own writing i have no doubt of it replied $marianne_dashwood$
there is no persuading you to change your mind $mrs_brandon$ i know of old said sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ when once you are determined on anything
consider here are the two miss careys come over from newton the three miss dashwoods walked up from the cottage and mr $mrs_willoughby$ got up two hours before his usual #time# on purpose to go to whitwell
colonel $mrs_brandon$ again repeated his #sorrow# at being the cause of disappointing the party but at the same #time# declared it to be unavoidable
but however i hope you #will# think better of it well then when #will# you come back again
i hope we shall see you at $barton$ added her ladyship as soon as you can conveniently leave town and we must put off the party to whitwell till you return
but it is so uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all
you are very obliging oh he must and shall come back cried sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ if he is not here by the end of the week i shall go after him
ay so do sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ cried $mrs_jennings$ and then perhaps you may find out what his business is i do not want to pry into other #man# concerns
i suppose it is something he is ashamed of colonel $mrs_brandon$ horses were announced you do not go to town on horseback do you added sir $mrs_john_dashwood$
no only to honiton i shall then go post well as you are resolved to go i #wish# you a good journey
but you had better change your mind i assure you it is not in my power he then took leave of the whole party
is there no chance of my seeing you and your #sister# in town this winter miss $marianne_dashwood$ i am afraid none at all
then i must bid you farewell for a longer #time# than i should #wish# to do to $marianne_dashwood$ he merely bowed and said #nothing#
come colonel said $mrs_jennings$ before you go do let us know what you are going about he wished her a good morning and attended by sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ left the room
the complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained now burst forth universally and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed
i can guess what his business is however said $mrs_jennings$ exultingly can you ma am said almost every body
yes it is about miss williams i am sure and who is miss williams asked $marianne_dashwood$
what do not you know who miss williams is i am sure you must have heard of her before she is a relation of the colonel my dear a very near relation
we #will# not say how near for fear of shocking the young #lady# then lowering her voice a little she said to $elinor$ she is his natural daughter
indeed oh yes and as like him as she can stare i dare say the colonel #will# leave her all his #fortune#
when sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ returned he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event concluding however by observing that as they were all got together they must do something by way of being happy and after some consultation it was agreed that although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country
he drove through the park very fast and they were soon out of sight and #nothing# more of them was seen till their return which did not happen till after the return of all the rest
they both seemed delighted with their drive but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes while the others went on the downs
it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening and that every body should be extremely merry all #day# long
some more of the careys came to dinner and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table which sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ observed with great contentment
the carriages were then ordered $mrs_willoughby$ was first and $marianne_dashwood$ never looked happier than when she got into it $mrs_willoughby$ took his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods
$mrs_jennings$ sat on $elinor$ right hand and they had not been long seated before she leant behind her and $mrs_willoughby$ and said to $marianne_dashwood$ loud enough for them both to hear i have found you out in spite of all your tricks
$marianne_dashwood$ coloured and replied very hastily where pray did not you know said $mrs_willoughby$ that we had been out in my curricle
yes yes mr impudence i know that very well and i was determined to find out where you had been to
it is a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you #will# have new furnished it for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago
i know where you spent the morning i hope you like your #house# miss $marianne_dashwood$ marianne turned away in great confusion
$mrs_jennings$ laughed heartily and $elinor$ found that in her resolution to know where they had been she had actually made her own woman enquire of mr $mrs_willoughby$ groom and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to allenham and spent a considerable #time# there in walking about the garden and going all over the #house#
$elinor$ could hardly believe this to be true as it seemed very unlikely that $mrs_willoughby$ should propose or $marianne_dashwood$ consent to enter the #house# while $mrs_smith$ was in it with whom $marianne_dashwood$ had not the smallest acquaintance
as soon as they left the dining room $elinor$ enquired of her about it and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by $mrs_jennings$ was perfectly true
$marianne_dashwood$ was quite angry with her for doubting it why should you imagine $elinor$ that we did not go there or that we did not see the #house#
is not it what you have often wished to do yourself yes $marianne_dashwood$ but i would not go while $mrs_smith$ was there and with no other companion than mr $mrs_willoughby$
mr $mrs_willoughby$ however is the only person who can have a right to shew that #house# and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to have any other companion
i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life i am afraid replied $elinor$ that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety
on the contrary #nothing# can be a stronger proof of it $elinor$ for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did i should have been sensible of it at the #time# for we always know when we are acting wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure
but my dear $marianne_dashwood$ as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct
if the impertinent remarks of $mrs_jennings$ are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of our lives
i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over $mrs_smith$ grounds or in seeing her #house#
they #will# one #day# be mr $mrs_willoughby$ and if they were one #day# to be your own $marianne_dashwood$ you would not be justified in what you have done
she blushed at this hint but it was even visibly gratifying to her and after a ten minutes interval of earnest thought she came to her #sister# again and said with great good humour perhaps $elinor$ it was rather ill judged in me to go to allenham but mr $mrs_willoughby$ wanted particularly to shew me the place and it is a charming #house# i assure you there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs of a nice comfortable size for constant use and with modern furniture it would be delightful
on one side you look across the bowling green behind the #house# to a beautiful hanging wood and on the other you have a view of the church and village and beyond them of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired
i did not see it to advantage for #nothing# could be more forlorn than the furniture but if it were newly fitted up a couple of hundred pounds $mrs_willoughby$ says would make it one of the pleasantest summer rooms in england
could $elinor$ have listened to her without interruption from the others she would have described every room in the #house# with equal delight
the sudden termination of colonel $mrs_brandon$ visit at the park with his steadiness in concealing its cause filled the mind and raised the wonder of $mrs_jennings$ for two or three #day# she was a great wonderer as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance
she wondered with little intermission what could be the reason of it was sure there must be some bad news and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all
it is a corner room and has windows on two sides chapter something very melancholy must be the matter i am sure said she
i could see it in his face poor #man# i am afraid his circumstances may be bad the estate at delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year and his brother left everything sadly involved
i do think he must have been sent for about money matters for what else can it be i wonder whether it is so
perhaps it is about miss williams and by the bye i dare say it is because he looked so conscious when i mentioned her
i would give anything to know the truth of it may be she is ill in town #nothing# in the world more likely for i have a notion she is always rather sickly
it is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances now for he is a very prudent #man# and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this #time#
i would lay any wager it is about miss williams i wonder what it can be may be his #sister# is worse at avignon and has sent for him over
his setting off in such a hurry seems very like it well i #wish# him out of all his trouble with all my heart and a good wife into the bargain
so wondered so talked $mrs_jennings$ her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture and all seeming equally probable as they arose
$elinor$ though she felt really interested in the welfare of colonel $mrs_brandon$ could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away which $mrs_jennings$ was desirous of her feeling for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation her wonder was otherwise disposed of
it was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her #sister# and $mrs_willoughby$ on the #subject# which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all
why they should not openly acknowledge to her #mother# and herself what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place $elinor$ could not imagine
she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power for though $mrs_willoughby$ was independent there was no reason to believe him rich
his estate had been rated by sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ at about six or seven hundred a year but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal and he had himself often complained of his poverty
but for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement which in fact concealed #nothing# at all she could not account and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of $marianne_dashwood$
as this silence continued every #day# made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both #nothing# could be more expressive of #attachment# to them all than $mrs_willoughby$ behaviour
it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover heart could give and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother
the cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home many more of his hours were spent there than at allenham and if no general engagement collected them at the park the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there where the rest of the #day# was spent by himself at the side of $marianne_dashwood$ and by his favourite pointer at her feet
one evening in particular about a week after colonel $mrs_brandon$ left the country his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of #attachment# to the objects around him and on mrs $marianne_dashwood$ happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him
to $marianne_dashwood$ what he exclaimed improve this dear cottage no that i #will# never consent to not a stone must be added to its walls not an inch to its size if my feelings are regarded
do not be alarmed said miss $marianne_dashwood$ #nothing# of the kind #will# be done for my #mother# #will# never have money enough to attempt it
i am heartily glad of it he cried may she always be poor if she can employ her riches no better
but you may be assured that i would not sacrifice one sentiment of local #attachment# of yours or of any one whom i loved for all the improvements in the world
depend upon it that whatever unemployed #sum# may remain when i make up my accounts in the spring i would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you
thank you $mrs_willoughby$ but are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it i am said he
nay more i consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable and were i rich enough i would instantly pull $combe_magna$ down and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage
to me it is faultless with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes i suppose said $elinor$
yes cried he in the same eager tone with all and every #thing# belonging to it in no one convenience or inconvenience about it should the least variation be perceptible
then and then only under such a roof i might perhaps be as happy at $combe_magna$ as i have been at $barton$
i flatter myself replied $elinor$ that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase you #will# hereafter find your own #house# as faultless as you now do this
there certainly are circumstances said $mrs_willoughby$ which might greatly endear it to me but this place #will# always have one claim of my affection which no other can possibly share
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ looked with pleasure at $marianne_dashwood$ whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on $mrs_willoughby$ as plainly denoted how well she understood him
how often did i #wish# added he when i was at allenham this #time# twelvemonth that $barton$ cottage were inhabited
how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from $mrs_smith$ when i next came into the country would be that $barton$ cottage was taken and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event which #nothing# but a kind of prescience of what happiness i should experience from it can account for
i never passed within view of it without admiring its situation and grieving that no one should live in it must it not have been so $marianne_dashwood$
speaking to her in a lowered voice then continuing his former tone he said and yet this #house# you would spoil mrs $marianne_dashwood$
and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together
you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford
you would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement mrs $marianne_dashwood$ again assured him that no alteration of the kind should be attempted
you are a good woman he warmly replied your promise makes me easy extend it a little farther and it #will# make me happy
tell me that not only your #house# #will# remain the same but that i shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you #will# always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me
the promise was readily given and $mrs_willoughby$ behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness
i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must walk to the park to call on $lady_middleton$
shall we see you tomorrow to dinner said mrs $marianne_dashwood$ when he was leaving them he engaged to be with them by four clock
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ visit to $lady_middleton$ took place the next #day# and two of her daughters went with her but $marianne_dashwood$ excused herself from being of the party under some trifling pretext of employment and her #mother# who concluded that a promise had been made by $mrs_willoughby$ the night before of calling on her while they were absent was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home
on their return from the park they found $mrs_willoughby$ curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage and mrs $marianne_dashwood$ was convinced that her conjecture had been just
so far it was all as she had foreseen but on entering the #house# she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect
they were no sooner in the passage than $marianne_dashwood$ came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction with her handkerchief at her eyes and without noticing them ran up stairs
surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted where they found only $mrs_willoughby$ who was leaning against the mantel piece with his back towards them
he turned round on their coming in and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over powered $marianne_dashwood$
i hope not he replied trying to look cheerful and with a forced smile presently added it is i who may rather expect to be ill for i am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment
chapter is anything the matter with her cried mrs $marianne_dashwood$ as she entered is she ill disappointment yes for i am unable to keep my engagement with you
$mrs_smith$ has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin by sending me on business to london
i have just received my dispatches and taken my farewell of allenham and by way of exhilaration i am now come to take my farewell of you
to london and are you going this morning almost this moment this is very unfortunate but $mrs_smith$ must be obliged and her business #will# not detain you from us long
i hope he coloured as he replied you are very kind but i have no idea of returning into devonshire immediately
my visits to $mrs_smith$ are never repeated within the twelvemonth and is $mrs_smith$ your only friend is allenham the only #house# in the neighbourhood to which you #will# be welcome
for shame $mrs_willoughby$ can you wait for an invitation here his colour increased and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied you are too good
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ looked at $elinor$ with surprise $elinor$ felt equal amazement for a few moments every one was silent mrs $marianne_dashwood$ first spoke
i have only to add my dear $mrs_willoughby$ that at $barton$ cottage you #will# always be welcome for i #will# not press you to return here immediately because you only can judge how far that might be pleasing to $mrs_smith$ and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination
my engagements at present replied $mrs_willoughby$ confusedly are of such a nature that i dare not flatter myself he stopt
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ was too much astonished to speak and another pause succeeded this was broken by $mrs_willoughby$ who said with a faint smile it is folly to linger in this manner
i #will# not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy
he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room they saw him step into his carriage and in a minute it was out of sight
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ felt too much for speech and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned
$mrs_willoughby$ behaviour in taking leave of them his embarrassment and affectation of cheerfulness and above all his unwillingness to accept her #mother# invitation a backwardness so unlike a lover so unlike himself greatly disturbed her
one moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her #sister# the distress in which $marianne_dashwood$ had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for though when she considered what $marianne_dashwood$ love for him was a quarrel seemed almost impossible
but whatever might be the particulars of their separation her #sister# affliction was indubitable and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent #sorrow# which $marianne_dashwood$ was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief but feeding and encouraging as a #duty#
$elinor$ uneasiness was at least equal to her #mother# she thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust in about #half# an hour her #mother# returned and though her eyes were red her countenance was not uncheerful
our dear $mrs_willoughby$ is now some miles from $barton$ $elinor$ said she as she sat down to work and with how heavy a heart does he travel
it is all very strange so suddenly to be gone it seems but the work of a moment and last night he was with us so happy so cheerful
and now after only ten minutes notice gone too without intending to return something more than what he owned to us must have happened
so affectionate he did not speak he did not behave like himself you must have seen the difference as well as i
what can it be can they have quarrelled why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here
it was not inclination that he wanted $elinor$ i could plainly see that he had not the power of accepting it
i assure you and i can perfectly account for every #thing# that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you
i have thought it all over can you indeed yes i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory
way but you $elinor$ who love to doubt where you can it #will# not satisfy you i know but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it
i am persuaded that $mrs_smith$ suspects his regard for $marianne_dashwood$ disapproves of it perhaps because she has other views for him and on that account is eager to get him away and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him
he is moreover aware that she does disapprove the connection he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with $marianne_dashwood$ and he feels himself obliged from his dependent situation to give into her schemes and absent himself from devonshire for a while
you #will# tell me i know that this may or may not have happened but i #will# listen to no cavil unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this
this is what i believe to have happened and now $elinor$ what have you to say #nothing# for you have anticipated my answer
then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened oh $elinor$ how incomprehensible are your feelings
you had rather take evil upon credit than good you had rather look out for misery for $marianne_dashwood$ and guilt for poor $mrs_willoughby$ than an apology for the latter
you are resolved to think him blameable because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn
and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment are no probabilities to be accepted merely because they are not certainties
is #nothing# due to the #man# whom we have all such reason to love and no reason in the world to think ill of
to the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves though unavoidably secret for a while and after all what is it you suspect him of
i can hardly tell myself but suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him
there is great truth however in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him and it is my #wish# to be candid in my judgment of every body
$mrs_willoughby$ may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct and i #will# hope that he has but it would have been more like $mrs_willoughby$ to acknowledge them at once
secrecy may be advisable but still i cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him do not blame him however for departing from his character where the deviation is necessary
but you really do admit the justice of what i have said in his defence i am happy and he is acquitted not entirely
it may be proper to conceal their engagement if they are engaged from $mrs_smith$ and if that is the case it must be highly expedient for $mrs_willoughby$ to be but little in devonshire at present
but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us concealing it from us my dear child do you accuse $mrs_willoughby$ and $marianne_dashwood$ of concealment
this is strange indeed when your eyes have been reproaching them every #day# for incautiousness i want no proof of their affection said $elinor$ but of their engagement i do
i am perfectly satisfied of both yet not a syllable has been said to you on the #subject# by either of them
has not his behaviour to $marianne_dashwood$ and to all of us for at least the last fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife and that he felt for us the #attachment# of the nearest relation
i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly have we not perfectly understood each other has not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive and affectionate respect
how is it to be supposed that $mrs_willoughby$ persuaded as he must be of your #sister# love should leave her and leave her perhaps for #month# without telling her of his affection that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence
i confess replied $elinor$ that every circumstance except one is in favour of their engagement but that one is the total silence of both on the #subject# and with me it almost outweighs every other
my $elinor$ is it possible to doubt their engagement how could such a thought occur to you how strange this is
you must think wretchedly indeed of $mrs_willoughby$ if after all that has openly passed between them you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together
has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your #sister# all this #time# do you suppose him really indifferent to her
but with a strange kind of tenderness if he can leave her with such indifference such carelessness of the future as you attribute to him
no i cannot think that he must and does love her i am sure you must remember my dear #mother# that i have never considered this matter as certain
i have had my doubts i confess but they are fainter than they were and they may soon be entirely done away
if we find they correspond every fear of mine #will# be removed a mighty concession indeed if you were to see them at the altar you would suppose they were going to be married
#nothing# in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt no secrecy has been attempted all has been uniformly open and unreserved
ungracious girl but i require no such proof you cannot doubt your #sister# #wish# it must be $mrs_willoughby$ therefore whom you suspect
but why is he not a #man# of honour and feeling has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm
can he be deceitful i hope not i believe not cried $elinor$ i love $mrs_willoughby$ sincerely love him and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me
it has been involuntary and i #will# not encourage it i was startled i confess by the alteration in his manners
this morning he did not speak like himself and did not return your kindness with any cordiality but all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed
he had just parted from my #sister# had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending $mrs_smith$ to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for some #time# he should seem to act an ungenerous a suspicious part by our family he might well be embarrassed and disturbed
in such a case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general
i #will# not raise objections against any one conduct on so illiberal a foundation as a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent
though we have not known him long he is no stranger in this part of the world and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage
had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once but this is not the case
not prosperously begun for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance and even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now be very advisable
character but you speak very properly $mrs_willoughby$ certainly does not deserve to be suspected it is an engagement in some respects
they were interrupted by the entrance of $margaret$ and $elinor$ was then at liberty to think over the representations of her #mother# to acknowledge the probability of many and hope for the justice of all
they saw #nothing# of $marianne_dashwood$ till dinner #time# when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word
she avoided the looks of them all could neither eat nor speak and after some #time# on her #mother# silently pressing her hand with tender compassion her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome she burst into tears and left the room
her eyes were red and swollen and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty this violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening
the slightest mention of anything relative to $mrs_willoughby$ overpowered her in an instant and though her family were most anxiously attentive to her comfort it was impossible for them if they spoke at all to keep clear of every #subject# which her feelings connected with him
she was without any power because she was without any desire of command over herself chapter $marianne_dashwood$ would have thought herself very inexcusable
she would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it
had she been able to sleep at all the first night after parting from $mrs_willoughby$ but the feelings which made such composure a disgrace left her in no danger of incurring it
she got up with a headache was unable to talk and unwilling to take any nourishment giving pain every moment to her #mother# and #sister# and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either
when breakfast was over she walked out by herself and wandered about the village of allenham indulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning
she was awake the whole night and she wept the greatest part of it her sensibility was potent enough the evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling
she played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to $mrs_willoughby$ every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained and this nourishment of grief was every #day# applied
in books too as well as in music she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving
she spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying her voice often totally suspended by her tears she read #nothing#
such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever it sunk within a few #day# into a calmer melancholy but these employments to which she daily recurred her solitary walks and silent meditations still produced occasional effusions of #sorrow# as lively as ever
but what they had been used to read together no #letter# from $mrs_willoughby$ came and none seemed expected by $marianne_dashwood$ her #mother# was surprised and $elinor$ again became uneasy
remember $elinor$ said she how very often sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ fetches our #letter# himself from the post and carries them to it
we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ hands
$elinor$ could not deny the truth of this and she tried to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence
but there was one method so direct so simple and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state of the affair and of instantly removing all mystery that she could not help suggesting it to her #mother#
but mrs $marianne_dashwood$ could find explanations whenever she wanted them which at least satisfied herself why do you not ask $marianne_dashwood$ at once said she whether she is or she is not engaged to $mrs_willoughby$
from you her #mother# and so kind so indulgent a #mother# the question could not give offence it would be the natural result of your affection for her
she used to be all unreserve and to you more especially i would not ask such a question for the world
supposing it possible that they are not engaged what distress would not such an enquiry inflict at any rate it would be most ungenerous
i should never deserve her confidence again after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one
i know $marianne_dashwood$ heart i know that she dearly loves me and that i shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible
i would not attempt to force the confidence of any one of a child much less because a #sense# of #duty# would prevent the denial which her #wish# might direct
$elinor$ thought this generosity overstrained considering her #sister# youth and urged the matter farther but in vain common #sense# common care common prudence were all sunk in mrs $marianne_dashwood$ romantic delicacy
it was several #day# before $mrs_willoughby$ name was mentioned before $marianne_dashwood$ by any of her family sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ and $mrs_jennings$ indeed were not so nice their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour but
one evening mrs $marianne_dashwood$ accidentally taking up a volume of shakespeare exclaimed we have never finished hamlet $marianne_dashwood$ our dear $mrs_willoughby$ went away before we could get through it
we #will# put it by that when he comes again but it may be #month# perhaps before that happens #month#
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ was sorry for what she had said but it gave $elinor$ pleasure as it produced a reply from $marianne_dashwood$ so expressive of confidence in $mrs_willoughby$ and #knowledge# of his intentions
one morning about a week after his leaving the country $marianne_dashwood$ was prevailed on to join her #sister# in their usual walk instead of wandering away by herself
cried $marianne_dashwood$ with strong surprise no nor many weeks hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles
if her #sister# intended to walk on the downs she directly stole away towards the lanes if they talked of the valley she was as speedy in climbing the hills and could never be found when the others set off
they walked along the road through the valley and chiefly in silence for $marianne_dashwood$ mind could not be controlled and $elinor$ satisfied with gaining one point would not then attempt more
beyond the entrance of the valley where the country though still rich was less wild and more open a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming to $barton$ lay before them and on reaching that point they stopped to look around them and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the cottage from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before
amongst the objects in the scene they soon discovered an animated one it was a #man# on horseback riding towards them
in a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman and in a moment afterwards $marianne_dashwood$ rapturously exclaimed it is he it is indeed i know it
but at length she was secured by the exertions of $elinor$ who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion is and was hastening to meet him when $elinor$ cried out indeed $marianne_dashwood$ i think you are mistaken
it is not $mrs_willoughby$ the person is not tall enough for him and has not his air he has he has cried $marianne_dashwood$
she walked eagerly on as she spoke and $elinor$ to screen $marianne_dashwood$ from particularity as she felt almost certain of its not being $mrs_willoughby$ quickened her pace and kept up with her
i am sure he has his air his coat his horse i knew how soon he would come they were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman
$marianne_dashwood$ looked again her heart sunk within her and abruptly turning round she was hurrying back when the voices of both her #sister# were raised to detain her a third almost as well known as $mrs_willoughby$ joined them in begging her to stop and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome $mr_edward_ferrars$
he was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being $mrs_willoughby$ the only one who could have gained a smile from her but she dispersed her tears to smile on him and in her #sister# happiness forgot for a #time# her own disappointment
he dismounted and giving his horse to his servant walked back with them to $barton$ whither he was purposely coming to visit them
he was welcomed by them all with great cordiality but especially by $marianne_dashwood$ who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than even $elinor$ herself
to $marianne_dashwood$ indeed the meeting between $mr_edward_ferrars$ and her #sister# was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at norland in their mutual behaviour
on $mr_edward_ferrars$ side more particularly there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion
he was confused seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them looked neither rapturous nor gay said little but what was forced from him by questions and distinguished $elinor$ by no mark of affection
she began almost to feel a dislike of $mr_edward_ferrars$ and it ended as every feeling must end with her by carrying back her thoughts to $mrs_willoughby$ whose manners formed a contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect
after a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries of meeting $marianne_dashwood$ asked $mr_edward_ferrars$ if he came directly from london
$marianne_dashwood$ saw and listened with increasing surprise no he had been in devonshire a fortnight a fortnight she repeated surprised at his being so long in the same county with $elinor$ without seeing her before
he looked rather distressed as he added that he had been staying with some friends near plymouth have you been lately in sussex said $elinor$
i was at norland about a #month# ago and how does dear dear norland look cried $marianne_dashwood$
dear dear norland said $elinor$ probably looks much as it always does at this #time# of the year the woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves
oh cried $marianne_dashwood$ with what transporting sensation have i formerly seen them fall how have i delighted as i walked to see them driven in showers about me by the wind
what feelings have they the season the air altogether inspired now there is no one to regard them they are seen only as a nuisance swept hastily off and driven as much as possible from the sight
it is not every one said $elinor$ who has your passion for dead leaves no my feelings are not often shared not often understood
she said this she sunk into a reverie for a few moments but rousing herself again now $mr_edward_ferrars$ said she calling his attention to the prospect here is $barton$ valley
but sometimes they are as look up to it and be tranquil if you can look at those hills did you ever see their equals
to the left is $barton$ park amongst those woods and plantations you may see the end of the #house# and there beneath that farthest hill which rises with such grandeur is our cottage
it is a beautiful country he replied but these bottoms must be dirty in winter how can you think of dirt with such objects before you
because replied he smiling among the rest of the objects before me i see a very dirty lane how strange said $marianne_dashwood$ to herself as she walked on
have you an agreeable neighbourhood here are the $middletons$ pleasant people no not all answered $marianne_dashwood$ we could not be more unfortunately situated
$marianne_dashwood$ cried her #sister# how can you say so how can you be so unjust they are a very respectable family $mr_edward_ferrars$ and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner
have you forgot $marianne_dashwood$ how many pleasant #day# we have owed to them no said $marianne_dashwood$ in a low voice nor how many painful moments
$elinor$ took no notice of this and directing her attention to their #visitor# endeavoured to support something like discourse with him by talking of their present residence its conveniences extorting from him occasional questions and remarks
his coldness and reserve mortified her severely she was vexed and #half# angry but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ was surprised only for a moment at seeing him for his coming to $barton$ was in her opinion of all #thing# the most natural
chapter her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder he received the kindest welcome from her and shyness coldness reserve could not stand against such a reception
they had begun to fail him before he entered the #house# and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of mrs $marianne_dashwood$
indeed a #man# could not very well be in love with either of her daughters without extending the passion to her and $elinor$ had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself
he was not in spirits however he praised their #house# admired its prospect was attentive and kind but still he was not in spirits
the whole family perceived it and mrs $marianne_dashwood$ attributing it to some want of liberality in his #mother# sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents
his affections seemed to reanimate towards them all and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible what are mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ views for you at present $mr_edward_ferrars$
said she when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself
no i hope my #mother# is now convinced that i have no more talents than inclination for a public life
for famous you must be to satisfy all your family and with no inclination for expense no affection for strangers no profession and no assurance you may find it a difficult matter
but how is your fame to be established i shall not attempt it i have no #wish# to be distinguished and have every reason to hope i never shall
thank heaven i cannot be forced into genius and eloquence you have no ambition i well know your #wish# are all moderate
i #wish# as well as every body else to be perfectly happy but like every body else it must be in my own way
as moderate as those of the rest of the world i believe greatness #will# not make me so strange that it would cried $marianne_dashwood$
what have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness grandeur has but little said $elinor$ but wealth has much to do with it
$elinor$ for shame said $marianne_dashwood$ money can only give happiness where there is #nothing# else to give it beyond a competence it can afford no real satisfaction as far as mere self is concerned
i dare say and without them as the world goes now we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting
perhaps said $elinor$ smiling we may come to the same point your competence and my wealth are very much alike your ideas are only more noble than mine
come what is your competence about eighteen hundred or two thousand a year not more than that $elinor$ laughed
two thousand a year one is my wealth i guessed how it would end and yet two thousand a year is a very moderate income said $marianne_dashwood$
a family cannot well be maintained on a smaller i am sure i am not extravagant in my demands a proper establishment of servants a carriage perhaps two and hunters cannot be supported on less
$elinor$ smiled again to hear her #sister# describing so accurately their future expenses at $combe_magna$ hunters repeated $mr_edward_ferrars$ but
why must you have hunters every body does not hunt $marianne_dashwood$ coloured as she replied but most people do i #wish# said $margaret$ striking out a novel thought that somebody would give us all a large #fortune# apiece
oh that they would cried $marianne_dashwood$ her eyes sparkling with animation and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness
we are all unanimous in that #wish# i suppose said $elinor$ in spite of the insufficiency of wealth
oh dear cried $margaret$ how happy i should be i wonder what i should do with it $marianne_dashwood$ looked as if she had no doubt on that point
i should be puzzled to spend so large a #fortune# myself said mrs $marianne_dashwood$ if my children were all to be rich without my help
you must begin your improvements on this #house# observed $elinor$ and your difficulties #will# soon vanish what magnificent orders would travel from this family to london said $mr_edward_ferrars$ in such an event
you miss $marianne_dashwood$ would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you and as for $marianne_dashwood$ i know her greatness of soul there would not be music enough in london to content her
and books thomson cowper scott she would buy them all over and over again she would buy up every copy i believe to prevent their falling into unworthy hands and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree
what a happy #day# for booksellers music sellers and print shops should not you $marianne_dashwood$ forgive me if i am very saucy but i was willing to shew you that i had not forgot our old disputes
i love to be reminded of the past $mr_edward_ferrars$ whether it be melancholy or gay i love to recall it and you #will# never offend me by talking of former #time#
you are very right in supposing how my money would be spent some of it at least my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books
and the bulk of your #fortune# would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs no $mr_edward_ferrars$ i should have something else to do with it
perhaps then you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life your opinion on that point is unchanged i presume
undoubtedly at my #time# of life opinions are tolerably fixed it is not likely that i should now see or hear any #thing# to change them
$marianne_dashwood$ is as steadfast as ever you see said $elinor$ she is not at all altered she is only grown a little more grave than she was
nay $mr_edward_ferrars$ said $marianne_dashwood$ you need not reproach me you are not very gay yourself why should you think so replied he with a sigh
nor do i think it a part of $marianne_dashwood$ said $elinor$ i should hardly call her a lively girl she is very earnest very eager in all she does sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation but she is not often really merry
but gaiety never was a part of my character i believe you are right he replied and yet i have always set her down as a lively girl
i have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes said $elinor$ in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other fancying people so much more gay or grave or ingenious or stupid than they really are and i can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated
sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves and very frequently by what other people say of them without giving oneself #time# to deliberate and judge
but i thought it was right $elinor$ said $marianne_dashwood$ to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people i thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours
this has always been your doctrine i am sure no $marianne_dashwood$ never my doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding
i am guilty i confess of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention but when have i advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters
all i have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour you must not confound my meaning you have not been able to bring your #sister# over to your plan of general civility said $mr_edward_ferrars$ to $elinor$
my judgment he returned is all on your side of the question but i am afraid my practice is much more on your #sister#
i never #wish# to offend but i am so foolishly shy that i often seem negligent when i am only kept back by my natural awkwardness
i have frequently thought that i must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company i am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility
do you gain no ground quite the contrary replied $elinor$ looking expressively at $marianne_dashwood$ marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers said $elinor$
she knows her own worth too well for false shame replied $mr_edward_ferrars$ shyness is only the effect of a #sense# of inferiority in some way or other
if i could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful i should not be shy but you would still be reserved said $marianne_dashwood$ and that is worse
$mr_edward_ferrars$ started reserved am i reserved $marianne_dashwood$ yes very i do not understand you replied he colouring reserved how in what manner
$elinor$ looked surprised at his emotion but trying to laugh off the #subject# she said to him do not you know my #sister# well enough to understand what she means
do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself
what am i to tell you what can you suppose $mr_edward_ferrars$ made no answer his gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him in their fullest extent and he sat for some #time# silent and dull
chapter $elinor$ saw with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend his visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect
it was evident that he was unhappy she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one
he joined her and $marianne_dashwood$ in the breakfast room the next morning before the others were down and $marianne_dashwood$ who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could soon left them to themselves
but before she was #half# way upstairs she heard the parlour door open and turning round was astonished to see $mr_edward_ferrars$ himself come out
i am going into the village to see my horses said he as you are not yet ready for breakfast i shall be back again presently
$mr_edward_ferrars$ returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding country in his walk to the village he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage and the village itself in a much higher situation than the cottage afforded a general view of the whole which had exceedingly pleased him
this was a #subject# which ensured $marianne_dashwood$ attention and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him when $mr_edward_ferrars$ interrupted her by saying you must not enquire too far $marianne_dashwood$
remember i have no #knowledge# in the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars
i shall call hills steep which ought to be bold surfaces strange and uncouth which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere
i call it a very fine country the hills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber and the valley looks comfortable and snug with rich meadows and several neat farm #house# scattered here and there
it exactly answers my idea of a fine country because it unites beauty with utility and i dare say it is a picturesque one too because you admire it i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me
you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give i know #nothing# of the picturesque
i am afraid it is but too true said $marianne_dashwood$ but why should you boast of it i suspect said $elinor$ that to avoid one kind of affectation $mr_edward_ferrars$ here falls into another
because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses
he is fastidious and #will# have an affectation of his own it is very true said $marianne_dashwood$ that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon
every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was
i detest jargon of every kind and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself because i could find no language to describe them in
i am convinced said $mr_edward_ferrars$ that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel
but what was worn and hackneyed out of all #sense# and meaning but in return your #sister# must allow me to feel no more than i profess
i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing
i have more pleasure in a snug farm #house# than a watch tower and a troop of tidy happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world
i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms $marianne_dashwood$ looked with amazement at $mr_edward_ferrars$ with compassion at her #sister#
$elinor$ only laughed the #subject# was continued no farther and $marianne_dashwood$ remained thoughtfully silent till a new object suddenly engaged her attention
she was sitting by $mr_edward_ferrars$ and in taking his tea from mrs $marianne_dashwood$ his hand passed so directly before her as to make a ring with a plait of hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his fingers
i never saw you wear a ring before $mr_edward_ferrars$ she cried is that $fanny$ hair i remember her promising to give you some
$marianne_dashwood$ spoke inconsiderately what she really felt but when she saw how much she had pained $mr_edward_ferrars$ her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his
but i should have thought her hair had been darker he coloured very deeply and giving a momentary glance at $elinor$ replied yes it is my #sister# hair
the setting always casts a different shade on it you know $elinor$ had met his eye and looked conscious likewise
that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as $marianne_dashwood$ the only difference in their conclusions was that what $marianne_dashwood$ considered as a free gift from her #sister# $elinor$ was conscious
she was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront and affecting to take no notice of what passed by instantly talking of something else she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself beyond all doubt that it was exactly the shade of her own
must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself $mr_edward_ferrars$ embarrassment lasted some #time# and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled
$marianne_dashwood$ severely censured herself for what she had said but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy had she known how little offence it had given her #sister#
before the middle of the #day# they were visited by sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ and $mrs_jennings$ who having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage came to take a survey of the guest
with the assistance of his #mother# in law sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ was not long in discovering that the name of $mr_edward_ferrars$ began with an and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted $elinor$ which #nothing# but the newness of their acquaintance with $mr_edward_ferrars$ could have prevented from being immediately sprung
but as it was she only learned from some very significant looks how far their penetration founded on $margaret$ instructions extended
sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ never came to the dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next #day# or to drink tea with them that evening
on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their #visitor# towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute he wished to engage them for both
you must drink tea with us to night said he for we shall be quite alone and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us for we shall be a large party
he was particularly grave the whole morning $mrs_jennings$ enforced the necessity and who knows but you may raise a dance said she
and that #will# tempt you miss $marianne_dashwood$ a dance cried $marianne_dashwood$ impossible who is to dance who why yourselves and the careys and whitakers to be sure what
you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone i #wish# with all my soul cried sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ that $mrs_willoughby$ were among us again
this and $marianne_dashwood$ blushing gave new suspicions to $mr_edward_ferrars$ and who is $mrs_willoughby$ said he in a low voice to miss $marianne_dashwood$ by whom he was sitting
$mr_edward_ferrars$ saw enough to comprehend not only the meaning of others but such of $marianne_dashwood$ expressions as had puzzled him before and when their #visitor# left them he went immediately round her and said in a whisper i have been guessing
she gave him a brief reply $marianne_dashwood$ countenance was more communicative shall i tell you my guess what do you mean
$marianne_dashwood$ was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner and after a moment silence said oh $mr_edward_ferrars$
shall i tell you certainly well then i guess that mr $mrs_willoughby$ hunts how can you but the #time# #will# come
i do not doubt it replied he rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general founded only on a something or a #nothing# between mr $mrs_willoughby$ and herself he would not have ventured to mention it
$mr_edward_ferrars$ remained a week at the cottage he was earnestly pressed by mrs $marianne_dashwood$ to stay longer but as if he were bent only on self mortification he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height
his spirits during the last two or three #day# though still very unequal were greatly improved he grew more and more partial to the #house# and environs never spoke of going away without a sigh declared his #time# to be wholly disengaged even doubted to what place he should go when he left them but still go he must
i hope i am sure you #will# like him chapter never had any week passed so quickly he could hardly believe it to be gone
he said so repeatedly other #thing# he said too which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions
he had no pleasure at norland he detested being in town but either to norland or london he must go he valued their kindness beyond any #thing# and his greatest happiness was in being with them
yet he must leave them at the end of a week in spite of their #wish# and his own and without any restraint on his #time#
$elinor$ placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his #mother# account and it was happy for her that he had a #mother# whose character was so imperfectly known to her as to be the general excuse for every #thing# strange on the part of her son
she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications which had been rather more painfully extorted from her for $mrs_willoughby$ service by her #mother#
his want of spirits of openness and of consistency were most usually attributed to his want of independence and his better #knowledge# of mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ disposition and designs
the shortness of his visit the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them originated in the same fettered inclination the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his #mother#
disappointed however and vexed as she was and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself the old well established grievance of #duty# against #will# parent against child was the cause of all
she would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease this opposition was to yield when mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ would be reformed and her son be at liberty to be happy
but from such vain #wish# she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in $mr_edward_ferrars$ affection to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at $barton$ and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger
i think $mr_edward_ferrars$ said mrs $marianne_dashwood$ as they were at breakfast the last morning you would be a happier #man# if you had any profession to engage your #time# and give an interest to your plans and actions
some inconvenience to your friends indeed might result from it you would not be able to give them so much of your #time#
but with a smile you would be materially benefited in one particular at least you would know where to go when you left them
it has been and is and probably #will# always be a heavy misfortune to me that i have had no necessary business to engage me no profession to give me employment or afford me any #thing# like independence
but unfortunately my own nicety and the nicety of my friends have made me what i am an idle helpless being
i do assure you he replied that i have long thought on this point as you think now we never could agree in our choice of a profession
i always preferred the church as i still do but that was not smart enough for my family they recommended the army
the law was allowed to be genteel enough many young #man# who had chambers in the temple made a very good appearance in the first circles and drove about town in very knowing gigs
that was a great deal too smart for me but i had no inclination for the law even in this less abstruse study of it which my family approved
as for the navy it had fashion on its side but i was too old when the #subject# was first started to enter it and at length as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all as i might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable and a young #man# of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do #nothing#
the consequence of which i suppose #will# be said mrs $marianne_dashwood$ since leisure has not promoted your own happiness that your sons #will# be brought up to as many pursuits employments professions and trades as columella
i was therefore entered at oxford and have been properly idle ever since they #will# be brought up said he in a serious accent to be as unlike myself as is possible
in feeling in action in condition in every #thing# come come this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits $mr_edward_ferrars$
but remember that the pain of parting from friends #will# be felt by every body at #time# whatever be their education or state
you are in a melancholy humour and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy know your own happiness you want #nothing# but patience or give it a more fascinating name call it hope
your #mother# #will# secure to you in #time# that independence you are so anxious for it is her #duty# and it #will# it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent
how much may not a few #month# do i think replied $mr_edward_ferrars$ that i may defy many #month# to produce any good to me
this desponding turn of mind though it could not be communicated to mrs $marianne_dashwood$ gave additional pain to them all in the parting which shortly took place and left an uncomfortable impression on $elinor$ feelings especially which required some trouble and #time# to subdue
but as it was her determination to subdue it and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by $marianne_dashwood$ on a similar occasion to augment and fix her #sorrow# by seeking silence solitude and idleness
$elinor$ sat down to her drawing table as soon as he was out of the #house# busily employed herself the whole #day# neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family and if by this conduct she did not lessen her own grief it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase and her #mother# and #sister# were spared much solicitude on her account
such behaviour as this so exactly the reverse of her own appeared no more meritorious to $marianne_dashwood$ than her own had seemed faulty to her
their means were as different as their objects and equally suited to the advancement of each the business of self command she settled very easily with strong affections
that her #sister# affections were calm she dared not deny though she blushed to acknowledge it and of the strength of her own she gave a very striking proof by still loving and respecting that #sister# in spite of this mortifying conviction
without shutting herself up from her family or leaving the #house# in determined solitude to avoid them or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation $elinor$ found every #day# afforded her leisure enough to think of $mr_edward_ferrars$ and of $mr_edward_ferrars$ behaviour in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different #time# could produce with tenderness pity approbation censure and doubt
there were moments in abundance when if not by the absence of her #mother# and #sister# at least by the nature of their employments conversation was forbidden among them and every effect of solitude was produced
her mind was inevitably at liberty her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere and the past and the future on a #subject# so interesting must be before her must force her attention and engross her memory her reflection and her fancy
from a reverie of this kind as she sat at her drawing table she was roused one morning soon after $mr_edward_ferrars$ leaving them by the arrival of company
the closing of the little gate at the entrance of the green court in front of the #house# drew her eyes to the window and she saw a large party walking up to the door
amongst them were sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ and $lady_middleton$ and $mrs_jennings$ but there were two others a gentleman and #lady# who were quite unknown to her
she was sitting near the window and as soon as sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ perceived her he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door and stepping across the turf obliged her to open the casement to speak to him though the space was so short between the door and the window as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other
it was impossible with calm ones it could have no merit she happened to be quite alone well said he we have brought you some strangers
how do you like them hush they #will# hear you never mind if they do it is only the palmers charlotte is very pretty i can tell you
as $elinor$ was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes without taking that liberty she begged to be excused
you may see her if you look this way where is $marianne_dashwood$ has she run away because we are come
they were now joined by $mrs_jennings$ who had not patience enough to wait till the door was opened before she told her story
i see her instrument is open she is walking i believe she came hallooing to the window how do you do my dear
how does mrs $marianne_dashwood$ do and where are your #sister# what all alone you #will# be glad of a little company to sit with you
i thought i heard a carriage last night while we were drinking our tea but it never entered my head that it could be them
i have brought my other son and daughter to see you only think of their coming so suddenly i thought of #nothing# but whether it might not be
colonel $mrs_brandon$ come back again so i said to sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ i do think i hear a carriage perhaps it is colonel $mrs_brandon$
again $elinor$ was obliged to turn from her in the middle of her story to receive the rest of the party $lady_middleton$ introduced the two strangers mrs $marianne_dashwood$ and $margaret$ came down stairs at the same #time# and they all sat down to look at one another while $mrs_jennings$ continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour attended by sir $mrs_john_dashwood$
she was short and plump had a very pretty face and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be
come back $mrs_palmer$ was several years younger than $lady_middleton$ and totally unlike her in every respect her manners were by no means so elegant as her #sister# but they were much more prepossessing
she came in with a smile smiled all the #time# of her visit except when she laughed and smiled when she went away
her husband was a grave looking young #man# of five or six and twenty with an air of more fashion and #sense# than his wife but of less willingness to please or be pleased
he entered the room with a look of self consequence slightly bowed to the #lady# without speaking a word and after briefly surveying them and their apartments took up a newspaper from the table and continued to read it as long as he staid
$mrs_palmer$ on the contrary who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and every #thing# in it burst forth
well what a delightful room this is i never saw anything so charming only think mama how it is improved since i was here last
i always thought it such a sweet place ma am turning to mrs $marianne_dashwood$ but you have made it so charming only look #sister# how delightful every #thing# is
how i should like such a #house# for myself should not you mr $mrs_palmer$ mr $mrs_palmer$ made her no answer and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper
this was quite a new idea to mrs $marianne_dashwood$ she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one and could not help looking with surprise at them both
$mrs_jennings$ in the meantime talked on as loud as she could and continued her account of their surprise the evening before on seeing their friends without ceasing till every #thing# was told
$mrs_palmer$ laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment and every body agreed two or three #time# over that it had been quite an agreeable surprise
you may believe how glad we all were to see them added $mrs_jennings$ leaning forward towards $elinor$ and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else though they were seated on different sides of the room but however i cant help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey of it for they came all round by london upon account of some business for you know
mr $mrs_palmer$ does not hear me said she laughing he never does sometimes it is so ridiculous nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter it was wrong in her situation
i wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning but she would come with us she longed so much to see you all
$mrs_palmer$ laughed and said it would not do her any harm she expects to be confined in february continued $mrs_jennings$
$lady_middleton$ could no longer endure such a conversation and therefore exerted herself to ask mr $mrs_palmer$ if there was any news in the paper
no none at all he replied and read on here comes $marianne_dashwood$ cried sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ now $mrs_palmer$ you shall see a monstrous pretty girl
$mrs_jennings$ asked her as soon as she appeared if she had not been to allenham and $mrs_palmer$ laughed so heartily at the question as to show she understood it
he immediately went into the passage opened the front door and ushered her in himself mr $mrs_palmer$ looked up on her entering the room stared at her some minutes and then returned to his newspaper
$mrs_palmer$ eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room she got up to examine them
oh dear how beautiful these are well how delightful do but look mama how sweet i declare they are quite charming i could look at them for ever
when $lady_middleton$ rose to go away mr $mrs_palmer$ rose also laid down the newspaper stretched himself and looked at them all around
and then sitting down again she very soon forgot that there were any such #thing# in the room my love have you been asleep said his wife laughing
he made her no answer and only observed after again examining the room that it was very low pitched and that the ceiling was crooked
he then made his bow and departed with the rest sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ had been very urgent with them all to spend the next #day# at the park
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage absolutely refused on her own account her daughters might do as they pleased
but they had no curiosity to see how mr and $mrs_palmer$ ate their dinner and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way
they attempted therefore likewise to excuse themselves the weather was uncertain and not likely to be good but sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ would not be satisfied the carriage should be sent for them and they must come
$mrs_jennings$ and $mrs_palmer$ joined their entreaties all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party and the young #lady# were obliged to yield
$lady_middleton$ too though she did not press their #mother# pressed them why should they ask us said $marianne_dashwood$ as soon as they were gone
the rent of this cottage is said to be low but we have it on very hard terms if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them or with us
they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now said $elinor$ by these frequent invitations than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago
the alteration is not in them if their parties are grown tedious and dull we must look for the change elsewhere
as the miss dashwoods entered the drawing room of the park the next #day# at one door $mrs_palmer$ came running in at the other looking as good humoured and merry as before
chapter she took them all most affectionately by the hand and expressed great delight in seeing them again
i am so glad to see you said she seating herself between $elinor$ and $marianne_dashwood$ for it is so bad a #day#
i was afraid you might not come which would be a shocking #thing# as we go away again tomorrow we must go for the westons come to us next week you know
and i knew #nothing# of it till the carriage was coming to the door and then mr $mrs_palmer$ asked me if i would go with him to $barton$
it was quite a sudden #thing# our coming at all he is so droll he never tells me any #thing# i am so sorry we cannot stay longer however we shall meet again in town very soon i hope
they were obliged to put an end to such an expectation not go to town cried $mrs_palmer$ with a laugh i shall be quite disappointed if you do not
i could get the nicest #house# in the world for you next door to ours in hanover square you must come indeed
i am sure i shall be very happy to chaperon you at any #time# till i am confined if mrs $marianne_dashwood$ should not like to go into public
oh my love cried $mrs_palmer$ to her husband who just then entered the room you must help me to persuade the miss dashwoods to go to town this winter
they thanked her but were obliged to resist all her entreaties her love made no answer and after slightly bowing to the #lady# began complaining of the weather
how horrid all this is said he such weather makes every #thing# and every body disgusting dullness is as much produced within doors as without by rain
it makes one detest all one acquaintance what the devil does sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ mean by not having a billiard room in his #house#
how few people know what comfort is sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ is as stupid as the weather the rest of the company soon dropt in
i am afraid miss $marianne_dashwood$ said sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ you have not been able to take your usual walk to allenham today
oh dont be so sly before us said $mrs_palmer$ for we know all about it i assure you and i admire your taste very much for i think he is extremely handsome
$marianne_dashwood$ looked very grave and said #nothing# we do not live a great way from him in the country you know
not above ten miles i dare say much nearer thirty said her husband ah well there is not much difference
i never was at his #house# but they say it is a sweet pretty place as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life said mr $mrs_palmer$
$marianne_dashwood$ remained perfectly silent though her countenance betrayed her interest in what was said is it very ugly continued mrs
$mrs_palmer$ then it must be some other place that is so pretty i suppose when they were seated in the dining room sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ observed with regret that they were only eight all together
my dear said he to his #lady# it is very provoking that we should be so few why did not you ask the gilberts to come to us today
did not i tell you sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ when you spoke to me about it before that it could not be done
they dined with us last you and i sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ said $mrs_jennings$ should not stand upon such ceremony then you would be very ill bred cried mr $mrs_palmer$
my love you contradict every body said his wife with her usual laugh do you know that you are quite rude
ay you may abuse me as you please said the good natured old #lady# you have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot give her back again
i did not know i contradicted any body in calling your #mother# ill bred so there i have the whip hand of you
charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid of her and exultingly said she did not care how cross he was to her as they must live together
it was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly good natured or more determined to be happy than $mrs_palmer$
the studied indifference insolence and discontent of her husband gave her no pain and when he scolded or abused her she was highly diverted
mr $mrs_palmer$ is so droll said she in a whisper to $elinor$ he is always out of humour
$elinor$ was not inclined after a little observation to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill natured or ill bred as he wished to appear
his temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding like many others of his sex that through some unaccountable bias in favour of beauty he was the husband of a very silly
woman but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible #man# to be lastingly hurt by it
it was rather a #wish# of distinction she believed which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body and his general abuse of every #thing# before him
the motive was too common to be wondered at but the means however they might succeed by establishing his superiority in ill breeding were not likely to attach any one to him except his wife
oh my dear miss $marianne_dashwood$ said $mrs_palmer$ soon afterwards i have got such a favour to ask of you and your #sister#
it was the desire of appearing superior to other people #will# you come and spend some #time# at cleveland this christmas
it #will# be quite delightful my love applying to her husband dont you long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland
now pray do and come while the westons are with us you cannot think how happy i shall be certainly he replied with a sneer i came into devonshire with no other view
there now said his #lady# you see mr $mrs_palmer$ expects you so you cannot refuse to come they both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation
but indeed you must and shall come i am sure you #will# like it of all #thing# the westons #will# be with us and it #will# be quite delightful
you cannot think what a sweet place cleveland is and we are so gay now for mr $mrs_palmer$ is always going about the country canvassing against the election and so many people came to dine with us that i never saw before it is quite charming
but poor fellow it is very fatiguing to him for he is forced to make every body like him $elinor$ could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the hardship of such an obligation
how charming it #will# be said charlotte when he is in parliament wont it how i shall laugh it #will# be so ridiculous to see all his #letter# directed to him with an p but
do you know he says he #will# never frank for me he declares he wont dont you mr $mrs_palmer$ mr $mrs_palmer$ took no notice of her
he cannot bear writing you know she continued he says it is quite shocking no said he i never said any #thing# so irrational
dont palm all your abuses of languages upon me there now you see how droll he is this is always the way with him
sometimes he wont speak to me for #half# a #day# together and then he comes out with something so droll all about any #thing# in the world
she surprised $elinor$ very much as they returned into the drawing room by asking her whether she did not like mr $mrs_palmer$ excessively
i thought you would he is so pleasant and mr $mrs_palmer$ is excessively pleased with you and your #sister# i can tell you and
you cant think how disappointed he #will# be if you dont come to cleveland i cant imagine why you should object to it
certainly said $elinor$ he seems very agreeable well i am so glad you do $elinor$ was again obliged to decline her invitation and by changing the #subject# put a stop to her entreaties
she thought it probable that as they lived in the same county $mrs_palmer$ might be able to give some more particular account of $mrs_willoughby$ general character than could be gathered from the $middletons$ partial acquaintance with him and she was eager to gain from any one such a confirmation of his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from $marianne_dashwood$
she began by inquiring if they saw much of mr $mrs_willoughby$ at cleveland and whether they were intimately acquainted with him
oh dear yes i know him extremely well replied $mrs_palmer$ not that i ever spoke to him indeed but i have seen him for ever in town
somehow or other i never happened to be staying at $barton$ while he was at allenham mama saw him here once
however i dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in somersetshire if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together
he is very little at $combe_magna$ i believe but if he were ever so much there i do not think mr $mrs_palmer$ would visit him for he is in the opposition you know and besides it is such a way off
before but i was with my #uncle# at weymouth i know why you inquire about him very well your #sister# is to marry him
upon my word replied $elinor$ you know much more of the matter than i do if you have any reason to expect such a match
i am monstrous glad of it for then i shall have her for a neighbour you know dont pretend to deny it because you know it is what every body talks of
upon my honour i did i met colonel $mrs_brandon$ monday morning in bond street just before we left town and he told me of it directly
i assure you i heard of it in my way through town my dear $mrs_palmer$ you surprise me very much
to give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it even if it were true is not what i should expect colonel $mrs_brandon$ to do
colonel $mrs_brandon$ tell you of it surely you must be mistaken but i do assure you it was so for all that and i #will# tell you how it happened
when we met him he turned back and walked with us and so we began talking of my brother and #sister# and one #thing# and another and i said to him so colonel there is a new family come to $barton$ cottage i hear and mama sends me word they are very pretty and that one of them is going to be married to mr $mrs_willoughby$ of $combe_magna$
is it true pray for of course you must know as you have been in devonshire so lately and what did the colonel say
oh he did not say much but he looked as if he knew it to be true so from that moment i set it down as certain
it #will# be quite delightful i declare when is it to take place mr $mrs_brandon$ was very well i hope
oh yes quite well and so full of your praises he did #nothing# but say fine #thing# of you
so do i he is such a charming #man# that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull
i am flattered by his commendation he seems an excellent #man# and i think him uncommonly pleasing mama says he was in love with your #sister# too
i assure you it was a great compliment if he was for he hardly ever falls in love with any body
yes extremely well that is i do not believe many people are acquainted with him because $combe_magna$ is so far off but they all think him extremely agreeable i assure you
is mr $mrs_willoughby$ much known in your part of somersetshire said $elinor$ oh nobody is more liked than mr $mrs_willoughby$ wherever he goes and so you may tell your #sister#
she is a monstrous lucky girl to get him upon my honour not but that he is much more lucky in getting her because she is so very handsome and agreeable that #nothing# can be good enough for her
for i think you both excessively pretty and so does mr $mrs_palmer$ too i am sure though we could not get him to own it last night
$mrs_palmer$ information respecting $mrs_willoughby$ was not very material but any testimony in his favour however small was pleasing to her
however i dont think her hardly at all handsomer than you i assure you i am so glad we are got acquainted at last continued
charlotte and now i hope we shall always be great friends you cant think how much i longed to see you it is so delightful that you should live at the cottage
#nothing# can be like it to be sure and i am so glad your #sister# is going to be well married
i hope you #will# be a great deal at $combe_magna$ it is a sweet place by all accounts you have been long acquainted with colonel $mrs_brandon$ have not you
i believe she added in a low voice he would have been very glad to have had me if he could
yes a great while ever since my #sister# married he was a particular friend of sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ and $lady_middleton$ wished it very much
but mama did not think the match good enough for me otherwise sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ would have mentioned it to the colonel and we should have been married immediately
did not colonel $mrs_brandon$ know of sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ proposal to your #mother# before it was made had he never owned his affection to yourself
oh no but if mama had not objected to it i dare say he would have liked it of all #thing#
he had not seen me then above twice for it was before i left school however i am much happier as i am
the palmers returned to cleveland the next #day# and the two families at $barton$ were again left to entertain each other
but this did not last long $elinor$ had hardly got their last #visitor# out of her head had hardly done wondering at charlotte being so happy without a cause at mr $mrs_palmer$ acting so simply with good abilities and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife before sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ and $mrs_jennings$ active zeal in the cause of society procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe
in a morning excursion to exeter they had met with two young #lady# whom $mrs_jennings$ had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations and this was enough for sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ to invite them directly to the park as soon as their present engagements at exeter were over
their engagements at exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation and $lady_middleton$ was thrown into no little alarm on the return of sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life and of whose elegance whose tolerable gentility even she could have no proof for the assurances of her husband and #mother# on that #subject# went for #nothing# at all
their being her relations too made it so much the worse and $mrs_jennings$ attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable because they were all cousins and must put up with one another
as it was impossible however now to prevent their coming $lady_middleton$ resigned herself to the idea of it with all the philosophy of a well bred woman contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the #subject# five or six #time# every #day#
mr $mrs_palmer$ is the kind of #man# i like chapter the young #lady# arrived their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable
their dress was very smart their manners very civil they were delighted with the #house# and in raptures with the furniture and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that $lady_middleton$ good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had been an hour at the park
sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the miss dashwoods of the $miss_steeles$ arrival and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world
from such commendation as this however there was not much to be learned $elinor$ well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of england under every possible variation of form face temper and understanding
she declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly and look at his guests
benevolent philanthropic #man# it was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself do come now said he pray come you must come i declare you shall come you cant think how you #will# like them
$miss_lucy_steele$ is monstrous pretty and so good humoured and agreeable the children are all hanging about her already as if she was an old acquaintance
and they both long to see you of all #thing# for they have heard at exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world and i have told them it is all very true and a great deal more
you #will# be delighted with them i am sure they have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children
how can you be so cross as not to come why they are your cousins you know after a fashion you are my cousins and they are my wife so you must be related
he could only obtain a promise of their calling at the park within a #day# or two and then left them in amazement at their indifference to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the $miss_steeles$ as he had been already boasting of the $miss_steeles$ to them
when their promised visit to the park and consequent introduction to these young #lady# took place they found in the appearance of the eldest who was nearly thirty with a very plain and not a sensible face #nothing# to admire but in the other who was not more than two or three and twenty they acknowledged considerable beauty her features were pretty and she had a sharp quick eye and a smartness of air which though it did not give actual elegance or grace gave distinction to her person
their manners were particularly civil and $elinor$ soon allowed them credit for some kind of #sense# when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to $lady_middleton$
with her children they were in continual raptures extolling their beauty courting their notice and humouring their whims and such of their #time# as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing if she happened to be doing any #thing# or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress in which her appearance the #day# before had thrown them into unceasing delight
fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles a fond #mother# though in pursuit of praise for her children the most rapacious of human beings is likewise the most credulous her demands are exorbitant but she #will# swallow any #thing# and the excessive affection and endurance of the $miss_steeles$ towards her offspring were viewed therefore by $lady_middleton$ without the smallest surprise or distrust
but sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ could not prevail she saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted
she saw their sashes untied their hair pulled about their ears their work bags searched and their knives and scissors stolen away and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment
it suggested no other surprise than that $elinor$ and $marianne_dashwood$ should sit so composedly by without claiming a share in what was passing
$mrs_john_dashwood$ is in such spirits today said she on his taking $miss_steeles$ pocket handkerchief and throwing it out of window he is full of monkey tricks
and soon afterwards on the second boy violently pinching one of the same #lady# fingers she fondly observed how playful william is
and here is my sweet little annamaria she added tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old who had not made a noise for the last two minutes
but unfortunately in bestowing these embraces a pin in her ladyship head dress slightly scratching the child neck produced from this pattern of gentleness such violent screams as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy
the #mother# consternation was excessive but it could not surpass the alarm of the $miss_steeles$ and every #thing# was done by all three in so critical an emergency which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer
she was seated in her #mother# lap covered with kisses her wound bathed with lavender water by one of the $miss_steeles$ who was on her knees to attend her and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other
and she is always so gentle and quiet never was there such a quiet little #thing# with such a reward for her tears the child was too wise to cease crying
she still screamed and sobbed lustily kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her and all their united soothings were ineffectual till $lady_middleton$ luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch and a slight intermission of screams in the young #lady# on hearing it gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected
she was carried out of the room therefore in her #mother# arms in quest of this medicine and as the two boys chose to follow though earnestly entreated by their #mother# to stay behind the four young #lady# were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours
poor little creatures said $miss_lucy_steele$ as soon as they were gone it might have been a very sad accident
yet i hardly know how cried $marianne_dashwood$ unless it had been under totally different circumstances but this is the usual way of heightening alarm where there is #nothing# to be alarmed at in reality
$marianne_dashwood$ was silent it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel however trivial the occasion and upon $elinor$ therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it always fell
she did her best when thus called on by speaking of $lady_middleton$ with more warmth than she felt though with far less than $miss_lucy_steele$
what a sweet woman $lady_middleton$ is said $miss_lucy_steele$ and sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ too cried the elder #sister# what a charming #man# he is
here too miss $marianne_dashwood$ commendation being only simple and just came in without any eclat she merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly
and what a charming little family they have i never saw such fine children in my life i declare i quite doat upon them already and indeed i am always distractedly fond of children
i have a notion said $miss_lucy_steele$ you think the little $middletons$ rather too much indulged perhaps they may be the outside of enough but it is so natural in $lady_middleton$ and for my part i love to see children full of life and spirits
i should guess so said $elinor$ with a smile from what i have witnessed this morning i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet
i confess replied $elinor$ that while i am at $barton$ park i never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence
a short pause succeeded this speech which was first broken by $miss_lucy_steele$ who seemed very much disposed for conversation and who now said rather abruptly and how do you like devonshire miss $marianne_dashwood$
in some surprise at the familiarity of this question or at least of the manner in which it was spoken $elinor$ replied that she was
i suppose you were very sorry to leave sussex norland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it added $miss_lucy_steele$
we have heard sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ admire it excessively said $miss_lucy_steele$ who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her #sister#
i think every one must admire it replied $elinor$ who ever saw the place though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do
i suppose you have not so many in this part of the world for my part i think they are a vast addition always
but why should you think said $miss_lucy_steele$ looking ashamed of her #sister# that there are not as many genteel young #man# in devonshire as sussex
and had you a great many smart beaux there nay my dear i sure i dont pretend to say that
i sure there a vast many smart beaux in exeter but you know how could i tell what smart beaux there might be about norland and
i was only afraid the miss dashwoods might find it dull at $barton$ if they had not so many as they used to have
but perhaps you young #lady# may not care about the beaux and had as lief be without them as with them
there ant for my part i think they are vastly agreeable provided they dress smart and behave civil but i cant bear to see them dirty and nasty
now there mr rose at exeter a prodigious smart young #man# quite a beau clerk to mr simpson you know and
yet if you do but meet him of a morning he is not fit to be seen i suppose your brother was quite a beau miss $marianne_dashwood$ before he married as he was so rich
but this i can say that if he ever was a beau before he married he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him
upon my word replied $elinor$ i cannot tell you for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word
anne cried her #sister# you can talk of #nothing# but beaux you #will# make miss $marianne_dashwood$ believe you think of #nothing# else
oh dear one never thinks of married #man# being beaux they have something else to do lord and then to turn the discourse she began admiring the #house# and the furniture
the vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation and as $elinor$ was not blinded by the beauty or the shrewd look of the youngest to her want of real elegance and artlessness she left the #house# without any #wish# of knowing them better
not so the $miss_steeles$ they came from exeter well provided with admiration for the use of sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ $lady_middleton$ his family and all his relations and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins whom they declared to be the most beautiful elegant accomplished and agreeable girls they had ever beheld and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted
and to be better acquainted therefore $elinor$ soon found was their inevitable lot for as sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ was entirely on the side of the $miss_steeles$ their party would be too strong for opposition and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the same room almost every #day#
sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ could do no more but he did not know that any more was required to be together was in his opinion to be intimate and while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual he had not a doubt of their being established friends
to do him justice he did every #thing# in his power to promote their unreserve by making the $miss_steeles$ acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins situations in the most delicate particulars and $elinor$ had not seen them more than twice before the eldest of them wished her joy on her #sister# having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to $barton$
twill be a fine #thing# to have her married so young to be sure said she and i hear he is quite a beau and prodigious handsome
this specimen of the $miss_steeles$ was enough and i hope you may have as good luck yourself soon but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already
$elinor$ could not suppose that sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for $mr_edward_ferrars$ than he had been with respect to $marianne_dashwood$ indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two as being somewhat newer and more conjectural and since $mr_edward_ferrars$ visit they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks as to excite general attention
the #letter# had been likewise invariably brought forward and found productive of such countless jokes that its character as the wittiest #letter# in the alphabet had been long established with $elinor$
the $miss_steeles$ as she expected had now all the benefit of these jokes and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman alluded to which though often impertinently expressed was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness into the concerns of their family
but sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ did not sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name as $miss_lucy_steele$ had in hearing it
his name is $mr_edward_ferrars$ said he in a very audible whisper but pray do not tell it for it a great secret
$mr_edward_ferrars$ repeated $miss_lucy_steele$ $mr_edward_ferrars$ is the happy #man# is he what your #sister# in law brother miss $marianne_dashwood$
a very agreeable young #man# to be sure i know him very well how can you say so anne
though we have seen him once or twice at my #uncle# it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well
cried $miss_lucy_steele$ who generally made an amendment to all her #sister# assertions $elinor$ heard all this with attention and surprise
she wished very much to have the #subject# continued though she did not chuse to join in it herself but #nothing# more of it was said and for the first #time# in her life she thought $mrs_jennings$ deficient either in curiosity after petty information or in a disposition to communicate it
the manner in which $miss_lucy_steele$ had spoken of $mr_edward_ferrars$ increased her curiosity for it struck her as being rather ill natured and suggested the suspicion of that #lady# knowing or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage but her curiosity was unavailing for no farther notice was taken of $mr_edward_ferrars$ name by $miss_lucy_steele$ when alluded to or even openly mentioned by sir $mrs_john_dashwood$
$marianne_dashwood$ who had never much toleration for any #thing# like impertinence vulgarity inferiority of parts or even difference of taste from herself was at this #time# particularly ill disposed from the state of her spirits to be pleased with the $miss_steeles$ or to encourage their advances and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side $elinor$ principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both but especially of $miss_lucy_steele$ who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments
$miss_lucy_steele$ was naturally clever her remarks were often just and amusing and as a companion for #half# an hour $elinor$ frequently found her agreeable but her powers had received no aid from education she was ignorant and illiterate and her deficiency of all mental improvement her want of information in the most common particulars could not be concealed from miss $marianne_dashwood$ in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage
$elinor$ saw and pitied her for the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable but she saw with less tenderness of feeling the thorough want of delicacy of rectitude and integrity of mind which her attentions her assiduities her flatteries at the park betrayed and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality and whose conduct toward others made every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless
you #will# think my question an odd one i dare say said $miss_lucy_steele$ to her one #day# as they were walking together from the park to the cottage but pray are you personally acquainted with your #sister# in law #mother# mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$
$elinor$ did think the question a very odd one and her countenance expressed it as she answered that she had never seen mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$
and who was this #uncle# where did he live how came they acquainted chapter indeed replied $miss_lucy_steele$ i wonder at that for i thought you must have seen her at norland sometimes
no returned $elinor$ cautious of giving her real opinion of $mr_edward_ferrars$ #mother# and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity
i am sure you think me very strange for enquiring about her in such a way said $miss_lucy_steele$ eyeing $elinor$ attentively as she spoke but perhaps there may be reasons i #wish# i might venture but however i hope you #will# do me the justice of believing that i do not mean to be impertinent
then perhaps you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is i know #nothing# of her $elinor$ made her a civil reply and they walked on for a few minutes in silence
it was broken by $miss_lucy_steele$ who renewed the #subject# again by saying with some hesitation i cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious
i am sure i would rather do any #thing# in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours
and i am sure i should not have the smallest fear of trusting you indeed i should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable situation as i am but however there is no occasion to trouble you
i am sorry i do not said $elinor$ in great astonishment if it could be of any use to you to know my opinion of her
but really i never understood that you were at all connected with that family and therefore i am a little surprised i confess at so serious an inquiry into her character
i am sorry you do not happen to know mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ i dare say you are and i am sure i do not at all wonder at it
mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ is certainly #nothing# to me at present but the #time# may come how soon it #will# come must depend upon herself when we may be very intimately connected
she looked down as she said this amiably bashful with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her
but if i dared tell you all you would not be so much surprised good heavens cried $elinor$ what do you mean
are you acquainted with mr $mr_robert_ferrars$ $mr_edward_ferrars$ can you be and she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a #sister# in law
no replied $miss_lucy_steele$ not to mr $mr_robert_ferrars$ $mr_edward_ferrars$ i never saw him in my life but fixing her eyes upon $elinor$ to his eldest brother
what felt $elinor$ at that moment astonishment that would have been as painful as it was strong had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it
she turned towards $miss_lucy_steele$ in silent amazement unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration and though her complexion varied she stood firm in incredulity and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit or a swoon
you may well be surprised continued $miss_lucy_steele$ for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before for i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family because it was always meant to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour
but anne and i never should have mentioned it to you if i had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy and i really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ must seem so odd that it ought to be explained
and i do not think $mr_edward_ferrars$ can be displeased when he knows i have trusted you because i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite as his own #sister# she paused
her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words but at length forcing herself to speak and to speak cautiously she said with calmness of manner which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude
not a soul of all my relations know of it $elinor$ for a few moments remained silent may i ask if your engagement is of long standing
we have been engaged these four years four years yes $elinor$ though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe it
i did not know said she that you were even acquainted till the other #day# our acquaintance however is of many years date
he was under my #uncle# care you know a considerable while your #uncle# yes mr pratt did you never hear him talk of mr pratt
i think i have replied $elinor$ with an exertion of spirits which increased with her increase of emotion he was four years with my #uncle# who lives at longstaple near plymouth
it was there our acquaintance begun for my #sister# and me was often staying with my #uncle# and it was there
our engagement was formed though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil but he was almost always with us afterwards
i was very unwilling to enter into it as you may imagine without the #knowledge# and approbation of his #mother# but i was too young and loved him too well to be so prudent as i ought to have
been though you do not know him so well as me miss $marianne_dashwood$ you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him
certainly answered $elinor$ without knowing what she said but after a moment reflection she added with revived security of $mr_edward_ferrars$ honour and love and her companion falsehood engaged to $mr_edward_ferrars$ i confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me that really i beg your pardon but surely there must be some mistake of person or name
$mr_edward_ferrars$ the eldest son of mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ of park street and brother of your #sister# in law mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ is the person i mean you must allow that i am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the #man# on who all my happiness depends
it is strange replied $elinor$ in a most painful perplexity that i should never have heard him even mention your name
we cannot mean the same $mr_edward_ferrars$ we can mean no other cried $miss_lucy_steele$ smiling no considering our situation it was not strange
you knew #nothing# of me or my family and therefore there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name to you and as he was always particularly afraid of his #sister# suspecting any #thing# that was reason enough for his not mentioning it
our first care has been to keep the matter secret she was silent $elinor$ security sunk but her self command did not sink with it
four years you have been engaged said she with a firm voice yes and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait
then taking a small miniature from her pocket she added to prevent the possibility of mistake be so good as to look at this face
it does not do him justice to be sure but yet i think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was drew
she put it into her hands as she spoke and when $elinor$ saw the painting whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision or her #wish# of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind she could have none of its being $mr_edward_ferrars$ face
poor $mr_edward_ferrars$ it puts him quite out of heart for i have had it above these three years she returned it almost instantly acknowledging the likeness
i have never been able continued $miss_lucy_steele$ to give him my picture in return which i am very much vexed at for he has been always so anxious to get it
but i am determined to set for it the very first opportunity you are quite in the right replied $elinor$ calmly
i am sure said she i have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret because you must know of what importance it is to us not to have it reach his #mother# for she would never approve of it i dare say
they then proceeded a few paces in silence $miss_lucy_steele$ spoke first i shall have no #fortune# and i fancy she is an exceeding proud woman
i certainly did not seek your confidence said $elinor$ but you do me no more than justice in imagining that i may be depended on
your secret is safe with me but pardon me if i express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication you must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety
as she said this she looked earnestly at $miss_lucy_steele$ hoping to discover something in her countenance perhaps the falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying but $miss_lucy_steele$ countenance suffered no change
i was afraid you would think i was taking a great liberty with you said she in telling you all this
i have not known you long to be sure personally at least but i have known you and all your family by description a great while and as soon as i saw you i felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance
besides in the present case i really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about $mr_edward_ferrars$ #mother# and i am so unfortunate that i have not a creature whose advice i can ask
anne is the only person that knows of it and she has no judgment at all indeed she does me a great deal more harm than good for i am in constant fear of her betraying me
she does not know how to hold her tongue as you must perceive and i am sure i was in the greatest fright in the worldt other #day# when $mr_edward_ferrars$ name was mentioned by sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ lest she should out with it all
you cant think how much i go through in my mind from it altogether i only wonder that i am alive after what i have suffered for $mr_edward_ferrars$ #sake# these last four years
every #thing# in such suspense and uncertainty and seeing him so seldom we can hardly meet above twice a year i am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke
continued $miss_lucy_steele$ after wiping her eyes i think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely
here she took out her handkerchief but $elinor$ did not feel very compassionate sometimes as she said this she looked directly at her companion
i cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable as i know the very mention of such a #thing# would do
but then at other #time# i have not resolution enough for it and on my own account too so dear as he is to me i dont think i could be equal to it
what would you advise me to do in such a case miss $marianne_dashwood$ what would you do yourself pardon me replied $elinor$ startled by the question but i can give you no advice under such circumstances
to be sure continued $miss_lucy_steele$ after a few minutes silence on both sides his #mother# must provide for him sometime or other but poor $mr_edward_ferrars$ is so cast down by it
he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple to go to you that i was afraid you would think him quite ill
your own judgment must direct you did you not think him dreadful low spirited when he was at $barton$ did he come from your #uncle# then when he visited us
no replied $elinor$ most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of $miss_lucy_steele$ veracity i remember he told us that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near plymouth
oh yes he had been staying a fortnight with us did you think he came directly from town
she remembered too her own surprise at the #time# at his mentioning #nothing# farther of those friends at his total silence with respect even to their names
did not you think him sadly out of spirits repeated $miss_lucy_steele$ we did indeed particularly so when he first arrived
i begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter but it made him so melancholy not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us and seeing me so much affected poor fellow i am afraid it is just the same with him now
i heard from him just before i left exeter taking a #letter# from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to $elinor$
you know his hand i dare say a charming one it is but that is not written so well as usual he was tired i dare say for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible
for he writes in wretched spirits $elinor$ saw that it was his hand and she could doubt no longer
this picture she had allowed herself to believe might have been accidentally obtained it might not have been $mr_edward_ferrars$ gift but a correspondence between them by #letter# could subsist only under a positive engagement could be authorised by #nothing# else for a few moments she was almost overcome her heart sunk within her and she could hardly stand but exertion was indispensably necessary and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings that her success was speedy and for the #time# complete
writing to each other said $miss_lucy_steele$ returning the #letter# into her pocket is the only comfort we have in such long separations
yes i have one other comfort in his picture but poor $mr_edward_ferrars$ has not even that if he had but my picture he says he should be easy
i gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at longstaple last and that was some comfort to him he said but not equal to a picture
i did said $elinor$ with a composure of voice under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any #thing# she had ever felt before
perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him she was mortified shocked confounded fortunately for her they had now reached the cottage and the conversation could be continued no farther
after sitting with them a few minutes the $miss_steeles$ returned to the park and $elinor$ was then at liberty to think and be wretched
however small $elinor$ general dependence on $miss_lucy_steele$ veracity might be it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description
what $miss_lucy_steele$ had asserted to be true therefore $elinor$ could not dared not longer doubt supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs and contradicted by #nothing# but her own #wish#
their opportunity of acquaintance in the #house# of mr pratt was a foundation for the rest at once indisputable and alarming and $mr_edward_ferrars$ visit near plymouth his melancholy state of mind his dissatisfaction at his own prospects his uncertain behaviour towards herself the intimate #knowledge# of the $miss_steeles$ as to norland and their family connections which had often surprised her the picture the #letter# the ring formed altogether such a body of evidence as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly and established as a fact which no partiality could set aside his ill treatment of herself her resentment of such behaviour her indignation at having been its dupe for a short #time# made her feel only for herself but other ideas other considerations soon arose
at this point in the first and second editions volume ends chapter had $mr_edward_ferrars$ been intentionally deceiving her had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel
was his engagement to $miss_lucy_steele$ an engagement of the heart no whatever it might once have been she could not believe it such at present
her #mother# #sister# $fanny$ all had been conscious of his regard for her at norland it was not an illusion of her own vanity
his affection was all her own she could not be deceived in that he certainly loved her what a softener of the heart was this persuasion
he had been blamable highly blamable in remaining at norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be
in that he could not be defended but if he had injured her how much more had he injured himself if her case were pitiable his was hopeless
his imprudence had made her miserable for a while but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise
how much could it not tempt her to forgive she might in #time# regain tranquillity but he what had he to look forward to
could he ever be tolerably happy with $miss_lucy_steele$ could he were his affection for herself out of the question with his integrity his delicacy and well informed mind be satisfied with a wife like her illiterate artful and selfish
the youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every #thing# but her beauty and good nature but the four succeeding years years which if rationally spent give such improvement to the understanding must have opened his eyes to her defects of education while the same period of #time# spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty
if in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself his difficulties from his #mother# had seemed great how much greater were they now likely to be when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections and probably inferior in #fortune# to herself
these difficulties indeed with a heart so alienated from $miss_lucy_steele$ might not press very hard upon his patience but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness could be felt as a relief
supported by the conviction of having done #nothing# to merit her present unhappiness and consoled by the belief that $mr_edward_ferrars$ had done #nothing# to forfeit her esteem she thought she could even now under the first smart of the heavy blow command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her #mother# and #sister#
and so well was she able to answer her own expectations that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes no one would have supposed from the appearance of the #sister# that $elinor$ was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love and that $marianne_dashwood$ was internally dwelling on the perfections of a #man# of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their #house#
the necessity of concealing from her #mother# and $marianne_dashwood$ what had been entrusted in confidence to herself though it obliged her to unceasing exertion was no aggravation of $elinor$ distress
on the contrary it was a relief to her to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of $mr_edward_ferrars$ which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself and which was more than she felt equal to support
from their counsel or their conversation she knew she could receive no assistance their tenderness and #sorrow# must add to her distress while her self command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise
she was stronger alone and her own good #sense# so well supported her that her firmness was as unshaken her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable as with regrets so poignant and so fresh it was possible for them to be
much as she had suffered from her first conversation with $miss_lucy_steele$ on the #subject# she soon felt an earnest #wish# of renewing it and this for more reasons than one
she wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again she wanted more clearly to understand what $miss_lucy_steele$ really felt for $mr_edward_ferrars$ whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him and she particularly wanted to convince $miss_lucy_steele$ by her readiness to enter on the matter again and her calmness in conversing on it that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend which she very much feared her involuntary agitation in their morning discourse must have left at least doubtful
that $miss_lucy_steele$ was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable it was plain that $mr_edward_ferrars$ had always spoken highly in her praise not merely from $miss_lucy_steele$ assertion but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance with a secret so confessedly and evidently important
as these considerations occurred to her in painful succession she wept for him more than for herself and even sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ joking intelligence must have had some weight
but indeed while $elinor$ remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by $mr_edward_ferrars$ it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that $miss_lucy_steele$ should be jealous and that she was so her very confidence was a proof
what other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be but that $elinor$ might be informed by it of $miss_lucy_steele$ superior claims on $mr_edward_ferrars$ and be taught to avoid him in future
she had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival intentions and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed to combat her own affection for $mr_edward_ferrars$ and to see him as little as possible she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince $miss_lucy_steele$ that her heart was unwounded
and as she could now have #nothing# more painful to hear on the #subject# than had already been told she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure
but it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be commanded though $miss_lucy_steele$ was as well disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred for the weather was not often fine enough to allow of their joining in a walk where they might most easily separate themselves from the others and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or cottage and chiefly at the former they could not be supposed to meet for the #sake# of conversation
such a thought would never enter either sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ or $lady_middleton$ head and therefore very little leisure was ever given for a general chat and none at all for particular discourse
they met for the #sake# of eating drinking and laughing together playing at cards or consequences or any other game that was sufficiently noisy
one or two meetings of this kind had taken place without affording $elinor$ any chance of engaging $miss_lucy_steele$ in private when sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ called at the cottage one morning to beg in the name of charity that they would all dine with $lady_middleton$ that #day# as he was obliged to attend the club at exeter and she would otherwise be quite alone except her #mother# and the two $miss_steeles$
$elinor$ who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view in such a party as this was likely to be more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well bred direction of $lady_middleton$ than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose immediately accepted the invitation $margaret$ with her #mother# permission was equally compliant and $marianne_dashwood$ though always unwilling to join any of their parties was persuaded by her #mother# who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement to go likewise
the insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as $elinor$ had expected it produced not one novelty of thought or expression and #nothing# could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room to the latter the children accompanied them and while they remained there she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging $miss_lucy_steele$ attention to attempt it
the young #lady# went and $lady_middleton$ was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her they quitted it only with the removal of the tea #thing#
the card table was then placed and $elinor$ began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding #time# for conversation at the park
they all rose up in preparation for a round game i am glad said $lady_middleton$ to $miss_lucy_steele$ you are not going to finish poor little annamaria basket this evening
and we #will# make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to morrow and then i hope she #will# not much mind it
this hint was enough $miss_lucy_steele$ recollected herself instantly and replied indeed you are very much mistaken $lady_middleton$ i am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me or i should have been at my filigree already
i would not disappoint the little angel for all the world and if you want me at the card table now i am resolved to finish the basket after supper
for i am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight you are very good i hope it wont hurt your eyes #will# you ring the bell for some working candles
my poor little girl would be sadly disappointed i know if the basket was not finished tomorrow for though i told her it certainly would not i am sure she depends upon having it done
$miss_lucy_steele$ directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child
no one made any objection but $marianne_dashwood$ who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility exclaimed your ladyship #will# have the goodness to excuse me you know i detest cards
$lady_middleton$ proposed a rubber of casino to the others i shall go to the piano forte i have not touched it since it was tuned
and without farther ceremony she turned away and walked to the instrument $lady_middleton$ looked as if she thanked heaven that she had never made so rude a speech
$marianne_dashwood$ can never keep long from that instrument you know ma am said $elinor$ endeavouring to smooth away the offence and i do not much wonder at it
for it is the very best toned piano forte i ever heard the remaining five were now to draw their cards
perhaps continued $elinor$ if i should happen to cut out i may be of some use to $miss_lucy_steele$ in rolling her papers for her and there is so much still to be done to the basket that it must be impossible
i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening i should like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it
indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help cried $miss_lucy_steele$ for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was and it would be a shocking #thing# to disappoint dear annamaria after all
you are very kind said $lady_middleton$ to $elinor$ and as you really like the work perhaps you #will# be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber or #will# you take your chance now
$elinor$ joyfully profited by the first of these proposals and thus by a little of that address which $marianne_dashwood$ could never condescend to practise gained her own end and pleased $lady_middleton$ at the same #time#
$miss_lucy_steele$ made room for her with ready attention and the two fair rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table and with the utmost harmony engaged in forwarding the same work
the pianoforte at which $marianne_dashwood$ wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts had by this #time# forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself was luckily so near them that miss $marianne_dashwood$ now judged she might safely under the shelter of its noise introduce the interesting #subject# without any risk of being heard at the card table
oh that would be terrible indeed said $miss_lucy_steele$ dear little soul how i do love her chapter
i should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with if i felt no desire for its continuance or no farther curiosity on its #subject#
thank you cried $miss_lucy_steele$ warmly for breaking the ice you have set my heart at ease by it for i was somehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i told you that monday
in a firm though cautious tone $elinor$ thus began i #will# not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again offended me
believe me and $elinor$ spoke it with the truest sincerity #nothing# could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea
how could you suppose so could you have a motive for the trust that was not honourable and flattering to me
and yet i do assure you replied $miss_lucy_steele$ her little sharp eyes full of meaning there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable
i felt sure that you was angry with me and have been quarrelling with myself ever since for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs
but i am very glad to find it was only my own fancy and that you really do not blame me
if you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what i am always thinking of every moment of my life your compassion would make you overlook every #thing# else i am sure
indeed i can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you to acknowledge your situation to me and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it
your case is a very unfortunate one you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties and you #will# have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them
he has only two thousand pounds of his own it would be madness to marry upon that though for my own part i could give up every prospect of more without a sigh
i have been always used to a very small income and could struggle with any poverty for him but i love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him perhaps of all that his #mother# might give him if he married to please her
$mr_edward_ferrars$ i believe is entirely dependent on his #mother# we must wait it may be for many years
with almost every other #man# in the world it would be an alarming prospect but $mr_edward_ferrars$ affection and constancy #nothing# can deprive me of i know
if the strength of your reciprocal #attachment# had failed as between many people and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years engagement your situation would have been pitiable indeed
that conviction must be every #thing# to you and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your
$miss_lucy_steele$ here looked up but $elinor$ was careful in guarding her countenance from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency
$mr_edward_ferrars$ love for me said $miss_lucy_steele$ has been pretty well put to the test by our long very long absence since we were first engaged and it has stood the trial so well that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now
i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment alarm on that account from the first
i am rather of a jealous temper too by nature and from our different situations in life from his being so much more in the world than me and our continual separation i was enough inclined for suspicion to have found out the truth in an instant if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met or any lowness of spirits that i could not account for or if he had talked more of one #lady# than another or seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he used to be
i do not mean to say that i am particularly observant or quick sighted in general but in such a case i am sure i could not be deceived
$elinor$ hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion $miss_lucy_steele$ went on all this thought $elinor$ is very pretty but it can impose upon neither of us
but what said she after a short silence are your views or have you none but that of waiting for mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ death which is a melancholy and shocking
extremity is her son determined to submit to this and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth
but mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ is a very headstrong proud woman and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it would very likely secure every #thing# to $mr_robert_ferrars$ and the idea of that for $mr_edward_ferrars$ #sake# frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures
if we could be certain that it would be only for a while and for your own #sake# too or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason
$miss_lucy_steele$ looked at $elinor$ again and was silent do you know mr $mr_robert_ferrars$ $mr_edward_ferrars$ asked $elinor$ not at all i never saw him but i fancy he is very unlike his brother silly and a great coxcomb
a great coxcomb repeated $miss_lucy_steele$ whose ear had caught those words by a sudden pause in $marianne_dashwood$ music
oh they are talking of their favourite beaux i dare say no #sister# cried $miss_lucy_steele$ you are mistaken there our favourite beaux are not great coxcombs
i can answer for it that miss $marianne_dashwood$ is not said $mrs_jennings$ laughing heartily for he is one of the modestest prettiest behaved young #man# i ever saw but as for $miss_lucy_steele$ she is such a sly little creature there is no finding out who she likes
oh cried $miss_lucy_steele$ looking significantly round at them i dare say $miss_lucy_steele$ beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as miss $marianne_dashwood$
$elinor$ blushed in spite of herself $miss_lucy_steele$ bit her lip and looked angrily at her #sister# a mutual silence took place for some #time#
$miss_lucy_steele$ first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone though $marianne_dashwood$ was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto i #will# honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head for bringing matters to bear indeed i am bound to let you into the secret for you are a party concerned
i dare say you have seen enough of $mr_edward_ferrars$ to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of some regard to me your brother might be persuaded to give him norland living which i understand is a very good one and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while
i should always be happy replied $elinor$ to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for $mr_edward_ferrars$ but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary
that would be enough for us to marry upon and we might trust to #time# and chance for the rest he is brother to mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ that must be recommendation enough to her husband
but mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ would not much approve of $mr_edward_ferrars$ going into orders then i rather suspect that my interest would do very little
at length $miss_lucy_steele$ exclaimed with a deep sigh i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement
we seem so beset with difficulties on every side that though it would make us miserable for a #time# we should be happier perhaps in the end
they were again silent for many minutes but you #will# not give me your advice miss $marianne_dashwood$ no answered $elinor$ with a smile which concealed very agitated feelings on such a #subject# i certainly #will# not
you know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you unless it were on the side of your #wish#
indeed you wrong me replied $miss_lucy_steele$ with great solemnity i know nobody of whose judgment i think so highly as i do of yours and i do really believe that if you was to say to me i advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with $mr_edward_ferrars$ it #will# be more for the happiness of both of you i should resolve upon doing it immediately
$elinor$ blushed for the insincerity of $mr_edward_ferrars$ future wife and replied this compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the #subject# had i formed one
it raises my influence much too high the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person
tis because you are an indifferent person said $miss_lucy_steele$ with some pique and laying a particular stress on those words that your judgment might justly have such weight with me
if you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings your opinion would not be worth having
$elinor$ thought it wisest to make no answer to this lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve and was even partly determined never to mention the #subject# again
another pause therefore of many minutes duration succeeded this speech and $miss_lucy_steele$ was still the first to end it
shall you be in town this winter miss $marianne_dashwood$ said she with all her accustomary complacency certainly not
i am sorry for that returned the other while her eyes brightened at the information it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there
but i dare say you #will# go for all that to be sure your brother and #sister# #will# ask you to come to them
it #will# not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do how unlucky that is i had quite depended upon meeting you there
anne and me are to go the latter end of january to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years
but i only go for the #sake# of seeing $mr_edward_ferrars$ he #will# be there in february otherwise london would have no charms for me i have not spirits for it
$elinor$ was soon called to the card table by the conclusion of the first rubber and the confidential discourse of the two #lady# was therefore at an end to which both of them submitted without any reluctance for #nothing# had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before and $elinor$ sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that $mr_edward_ferrars$ was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage which sincere affection on her side would have given for self interest alone could induce a woman to keep a #man# to an engagement of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary
from this #time# the #subject# was never revived by $elinor$ and when entered on by $miss_lucy_steele$ who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it and was particularly careful to inform her confidante of her happiness whenever she received a #letter# from $mr_edward_ferrars$ it was treated by the former with calmness and caution and dismissed as soon as civility would allow for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which $miss_lucy_steele$ did not deserve and which were dangerous to herself
their favour increased they could not be spared sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ would not hear of their going and in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in exeter in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately which was in full force at the end of every week they were prevailed on to stay nearly two #month# at the park and to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance
the visit of the $miss_steeles$ at $barton$ park was lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied chapter
though $mrs_jennings$ was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the #house# of her children and friends she was not without a settled habitation of her own
since the death of her husband who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town she had resided every winter in a #house# in one of the streets near portman square
towards this home she began on the approach of january to turn her thoughts and thither she one #day# abruptly and very unexpectedly by them asked the elder misses $marianne_dashwood$ to accompany her
$elinor$ without observing the varying complexion of her #sister# and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations
the reason alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their #mother# at that #time# of the year $mrs_jennings$ received the refusal with some surprise and repeated her invitation immediately
i am sure your #mother# can spare you very well and i do beg you #will# favour me with your company for i ve quite set my heart upon it
dont fancy that you #will# be any inconvenience to me for i shant put myself at all out of my way for you
we three shall be able to go very well in my chaise and when we are in town if you do not like to go wherever i do well and good you may always go with one of my daughters
i am sure your #mother# #will# not object to it for i have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she #will# think me a very fit person to have the charge of you and if i dont get one of you at least well married before i have done with you it shall not be my fault
oh lord it #will# only be sending betty by the coach and i hope i can afford that i shall speak a good word for you to all the young #man# you may depend upon it
i have a notion said sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ that miss $marianne_dashwood$ would not object to such a scheme if her elder #sister# would come into it
so i would advise you two to set off for town when you are tired of $barton$ without saying a word to miss $marianne_dashwood$ about it
nay cried $mrs_jennings$ i am sure i shall be monstrous glad of miss $marianne_dashwood$ company whether miss $marianne_dashwood$ #will# go or not only the more the merrier say i and i thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together because if they got tired of me they might talk to one another and laugh at my old ways behind my back
it is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure because miss $marianne_dashwood$ does not #wish# it but one or the other if not both of them i must have
how do you think i can live poking by myself i who have been always used till this winter to have charlotte with me
come miss $marianne_dashwood$ let us strike hands upon the bargain and if miss $marianne_dashwood$ #will# change her mind by and bye why so much the better
i thank you ma am sincerely thank you said $marianne_dashwood$ with warmth your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable of to be able to accept it
but my #mother# my dearest kindest #mother# i feel the justice of what $elinor$ has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence oh
lord bless me no #nothing# should tempt me to leave her it should not must not be a struggle
$mrs_jennings$ repeated her assurance that mrs $marianne_dashwood$ could spare them perfectly well and $elinor$ who now understood her #sister# and saw to what indifference to almost every #thing# else she was carried by her eagerness to be with $mrs_willoughby$ again made no farther direct opposition to the plan and merely referred it to her #mother# decision from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit which she could not approve of for $marianne_dashwood$ and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid
whatever $marianne_dashwood$ was desirous of her #mother# would be eager to promote she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to london
that $marianne_dashwood$ fastidious as she was thoroughly acquainted with $mrs_jennings$ manners and invariably disgusted by them should overlook every inconvenience of that kind should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings in her pursuit of one object was such a proof so strong so full of the importance of that object to her as $elinor$ in spite of all that had passed was not prepared to witness
on being informed of the invitation mrs $marianne_dashwood$ persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself how much the heart of $marianne_dashwood$ was in it would not hear of their declining the offer upon her account insisted on their both accepting it directly and then began to foresee with her usual cheerfulness a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all from this separation
i am delighted with the plan she cried it is exactly what i could #wish# $margaret$ and i shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves
when you and the $middletons$ are gone we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music
i have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one
it is very right that you should go to town i would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of london
you #will# be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman of whose kindness to you i can have no doubt
and in all probability you #will# see your brother and whatever may be his faults or the faults of his wife when i consider whose son he is i cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other
though with your usual anxiety for our happiness said $elinor$ you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you there is still one objection which in my opinion cannot be so easily removed
you #will# find $margaret$ so improved when you come back again $marianne_dashwood$ countenance sunk and what said mrs $marianne_dashwood$ is my dear prudent $elinor$ going to suggest
what formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward do let me hear a word about the expense of it
my objection is this though i think very well of $mrs_jennings$ heart she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure or whose protection #will# give us consequence
that is very true replied her #mother# but of her society separately from that of other people you #will# scarcely have any #thing# at all and you #will# almost always appear in public with $lady_middleton$
if $elinor$ is frightened away by her dislike of $mrs_jennings$ said $marianne_dashwood$ at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation
i have no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort
$elinor$ could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading $marianne_dashwood$ to behave with tolerable politeness and resolved within herself that if her #sister# persisted in going she would go likewise as she did not think it proper that $marianne_dashwood$ should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment or that $mrs_jennings$ should be abandoned to the mercy of $marianne_dashwood$ for all the comfort of her domestic hours
to this determination she was the more easily reconciled by recollecting that $mr_edward_ferrars$ by $miss_lucy_steele$ account was not to be in town before february and that their visit without any unreasonable abridgement might be previously finished
you #will# have much pleasure in being in london and especially in being together and if $elinor$ would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of sources she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her #sister# in law family
$elinor$ had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her #mother# dependence on the #attachment# of $mr_edward_ferrars$ and herself that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed and now on this attack though almost hopeless of success she forced herself to begin her design by saying as calmly as she could i like $mr_edward_ferrars$ very much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am ever known to them or not
i #will# have you both go said mrs $marianne_dashwood$ these objections are nonsensical mrs $marianne_dashwood$ smiled and said #nothing#
$marianne_dashwood$ lifted up her eyes in astonishment and $elinor$ conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue after very little farther discourse it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted
$mrs_jennings$ received the information with a great deal of joy and many assurances of kindness and care nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her
sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ was delighted for to a #man# whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone the acquisition of two to the number of inhabitants in london was something
even $lady_middleton$ took the trouble of being delighted which was putting herself rather out of her way and as for the $miss_steeles$ especially $miss_lucy_steele$ they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them
with regard to herself it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not and when she saw her #mother# so thoroughly pleased with the plan and her #sister# exhilarated by it in look voice and manner restored to all her usual animation and elevated to more than her usual gaiety she could not be dissatisfied with the cause and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence
$marianne_dashwood$ joy was almost a degree beyond happiness so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone
her unwillingness to quit her #mother# was her only restorative to calmness and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive
her #mother# affliction was hardly less and $elinor$ was the only one of the three who seemed to consider the separation as any #thing# short of eternal
$elinor$ submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her #wish# with less reluctance than she had expected to feel their departure took place in the first week in january
the $miss_steeles$ kept their station at the park and were to quit it only with the rest of the family
chapter $elinor$ could not find herself in the carriage with $mrs_jennings$ and beginning a journey to london under her protection and as her guest without wondering at her own situation so short had their acquaintance with that #lady# been so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few #day# before
but these objections had all with that happy ardour of youth which $marianne_dashwood$ and her #mother# equally shared been overcome or overlooked and $elinor$ in spite of every occasional doubt of $mrs_willoughby$ constancy could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of $marianne_dashwood$ without feeling how blank was her own prospect how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of $marianne_dashwood$ situation to have the same animating object in view the same possibility of hope
a short a very short #time# however must now decide what $mrs_willoughby$ intentions were in all probability he was already in town
$marianne_dashwood$ eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there and $elinor$ was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her #sister# with such zealous attention as to ascertain what he was and what he meant before many meetings had taken place
should the result of her observations be unfavourable she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her #sister# should it be otherwise her exertions would be of a different nature she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of $marianne_dashwood$
they were three #day# on their journey and $marianne_dashwood$ behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to $mrs_jennings$ might be expected to be
she sat in silence almost all the way wrapt in her own meditations and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her #sister#
to atone for this conduct therefore $elinor$ took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had assigned herself behaved with the greatest attention to $mrs_jennings$ talked with her laughed with her and listened to her whenever she could and $mrs_jennings$ on her side treated them both with all possible kindness was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod or boiled fowls to veal cutlets
they reached town by three clock the third #day# glad to be released after such a journey from the confinement of a carriage and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire
the #house# was handsome and handsomely fitted up and the young #lady# were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment
it had formerly been charlotte and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect
as dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival $elinor$ determined to employ the interval in writing to her #mother# and sat down for that purpose
the $middletons$ were to follow in about a week in a few moments $marianne_dashwood$ did the same i am writing home $marianne_dashwood$ said $elinor$ had not you better defer your #letter# for a #day# or two
i am not going to write to my #mother# replied $marianne_dashwood$ hastily and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry
it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to $mrs_willoughby$ and the conclusion which as instantly followed was that however mysteriously they might #wish# to conduct the affair they must be engaged
$elinor$ said no more this conviction though not entirely satisfactory gave her pleasure and she continued her #letter# with greater alacrity
$marianne_dashwood$ was finished in a very few minutes in length it could be no more than a note it was then folded up sealed and directed with eager rapidity
$elinor$ thought she could distinguish a large in the direction and no sooner was it complete than $marianne_dashwood$ ringing the bell requested the footman who answered it to get that #letter# conveyed for her to the two penny post
her spirits still continued very high but there was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her #sister# and this agitation increased as the evening drew on
she could scarcely eat any dinner and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage
it was a great satisfaction to $elinor$ that $mrs_jennings$ by being much engaged in her own room could see little of what was passing
the tea #thing# were brought in and already had $marianne_dashwood$ been disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door when a loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other #house# $elinor$ felt secure of its announcing $mrs_willoughby$ approach and $marianne_dashwood$ starting up moved towards the door
every #thing# was silent this could not be borne many seconds she opened the door advanced a few steps towards the stairs and after listening #half# a minute returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming oh $elinor$ it is $mrs_willoughby$ indeed it is and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms when colonel $mrs_brandon$ appeared
this decided the matter at once it was too great a shock to be borne with calmness and she immediately left the room
$elinor$ was disappointed too but at the same #time# her regard for colonel $mrs_brandon$ ensured his welcome with her and she felt particularly hurt that a #man# so partial to her #sister# should perceive that she experienced #nothing# but grief and disappointment in seeing him
she instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him that he even observed $marianne_dashwood$ as she quitted the room with such astonishment and concern as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself
$elinor$ answered in some distress that she was and then talked of head aches low spirits and over fatigues and of every #thing# to which she could decently attribute her #sister# behaviour
he heard her with the most earnest attention but seeming to recollect himself said no more on the #subject# and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in london making the usual inquiries about their journey and the friends they had left behind
in this calm kind of way with very little interest on either side they continued to talk both of them out of spirits and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere
$elinor$ wished very much to ask whether $mrs_willoughby$ were then in town but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival and at length by way of saying something she asked if he had been in london ever since she had seen him last
i have been once or twice at delaford for a few #day# but it has never been in my power to return to $barton$
this and the manner in which it was said immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to $mrs_jennings$ and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the #subject# than she had ever felt
is your #sister# ill said he yes he replied with some embarrassment almost ever since $mrs_jennings$ soon came in
colonel said she with her usual noisy cheerfulness i am monstrous glad to see you sorry i could not come before beg your pardon but i have been forced to look about me a little and settle my matters for it is a long while since i have been at home and you know one has always a world of little odd #thing# to do after one has been away for any #time# and then i have had cartwright to settle with lord i have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner
oh but pray colonel how came you to conjure out that i should be in town today i had the pleasure of hearing it at mr $mrs_palmer$ where i have been dining
oh you did well and how do they all do at their #house# how does charlotte do i warrant you
she is a fine size by this #time# $mrs_palmer$ appeared quite well and i am commissioned to tell you that you #will# certainly see her to morrow
ay to be sure i thought as much well colonel i have brought two young #lady# with me you see
that is you see but one of them now but there is another somewhere your friend miss $marianne_dashwood$ too which you #will# not be sorry to hear
i do not know what you and mr $mrs_willoughby$ #will# do between you about her ay it is a fine #thing# to be young and handsome
well i was young once but i never was very handsome worse luck for me however i got a very good husband and i dont know what the greatest beauty can do more
ah poor #man# he has been dead these eight years and better but colonel where have you been to since we parted
and how does your business go on come come let have no secrets among friends he replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries but without satisfying her in any
after her entrance colonel $mrs_brandon$ became more thoughtful and silent than he had been before and $mrs_jennings$ could not prevail on him to stay long
$elinor$ now began to make the tea and $marianne_dashwood$ was obliged to appear again no other #visitor# appeared that evening and the #lady# were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed
$marianne_dashwood$ rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks the disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen that #day#
they had not long finished their breakfast before $mrs_palmer$ barouche stopped at the door and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room so delighted to see them all that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure from meeting her #mother# or the miss dashwoods again
so surprised at their coming to town though it was what she had rather expected all along so angry at their accepting her #mother# invitation after having declined her own though at the same #time# she would never have forgiven them if they had not come
mr $mrs_palmer$ #will# be so happy to see you said she what do you think he said when he heard of your coming with mama
after an hour or two spent in what her #mother# called comfortable chat or in other words in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on $mrs_jennings$ side and in laughter without cause on $mrs_palmer$ it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning to which $mrs_jennings$ and $elinor$ readily consented as having likewise some purchases to make themselves and $marianne_dashwood$ though declining it at first was induced to go likewise
i forget what it was now but it was something so droll wherever they went she was evidently always on the watch
in bond street especially where much of their business lay her eyes were in constant inquiry and in whatever shop the party were engaged her mind was equally abstracted from every #thing# actually before them from all that interested and occupied the others
restless and dissatisfied every where her #sister# could never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase however it might equally concern them both she received no pleasure from anything was only impatient to be at home again and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of $mrs_palmer$ whose eye was caught by every #thing# pretty expensive or new who was wild to buy all could determine on none and dawdled away her #time# in rapture and indecision
it was late in the morning before they returned home and no sooner had they entered the #house# than $marianne_dashwood$ flew eagerly up stairs and when $elinor$ followed she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance which declared that no $mrs_willoughby$ had been there
has no #letter# been left here for me since we went out said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels
she was answered in the negative are you quite sure of it she replied are you certain that no servant no porter has left any #letter# or note
the #man# replied that none had how very odd said she in a low and disappointed voice as she turned away to the window
if she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him as she did she would have written to $combe_magna$ and if he is in town how odd that he should neither come nor write
my dear #mother# you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young a #man# so little known to be carried on in so doubtful so mysterious a manner
how odd indeed repeated $elinor$ within herself regarding her #sister# with uneasiness oh i long to inquire and how #will# my interference be borne
she determined after some consideration that if appearances continued many #day# longer as unpleasant as they now were she would represent in the strongest manner to her #mother# the necessity of some serious enquiry into the affair
$mrs_palmer$ and two elderly #lady# of $mrs_jennings$ intimate acquaintance whom she had met and invited in the morning dined with them
the former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements and $elinor$ was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others
$marianne_dashwood$ was of no use on these occasions as she would never learn the game but though her #time# was therefore at her own disposal the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to $elinor$ for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment
she sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read but the book was soon thrown aside and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window in hopes of distinguishing the long expected rap
if this open weather holds much longer said $mrs_jennings$ when they met at breakfast the following morning sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ #will# not like leaving $barton$ next week tis a sad #thing# for sportsmen to lose a #day# pleasure
chapter poor souls i always pity them when they do they seem to take it so much to heart
that is true cried $marianne_dashwood$ in a cheerful voice and walking to the window as she spoke to examine the #day#
i had not thought of that this weather #will# keep many sportsmen in the country it was a lucky recollection all her good spirits were restored by it
it is charming weather for them indeed she continued as she sat down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance
how much they must enjoy it but with a little return of anxiety it cannot be expected to last long
at this #time# of the year and after such a series of rain we shall certainly have very little more of it
frosts #will# soon set in and in all probability with severity in another #day# or two perhaps this extreme mildness can hardly last longer nay perhaps it may freeze tonight
at any rate said $elinor$ wishing to prevent $mrs_jennings$ from seeing her #sister# thoughts as clearly as she did i dare say we shall have sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ and $lady_middleton$ in town by the end of next week
ay my dear i ll warrant you we do mary always has her own way and now silently conjectured $elinor$ she #will# write to $combe_magna$ by this #day# post
but if she did the #letter# was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact
whatever the truth of it might be and far as $elinor$ was from feeling thorough contentment about it yet while she saw $marianne_dashwood$ in spirits she could not be very uncomfortable herself
and $marianne_dashwood$ was in spirits happy in the mildness of the weather and still happier in her expectation of a frost
the morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the #house# of $mrs_jennings$ acquaintance to inform them of her being in town and $marianne_dashwood$ was all the #time# busy in observing the direction of the wind watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air
dont you find it colder than it was in the morning $elinor$ there seems to me a very decided difference
i can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff it was not so yesterday i think the clouds seem parting too the sun #will# be out in a moment and we shall have a clear afternoon
$elinor$ was alternately diverted and pained but $marianne_dashwood$ persevered and saw every night in the brightness of the fire and
the miss dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with $mrs_jennings$ style of living and set of acquaintance than with her behaviour to themselves which was invariably kind
every #thing# in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan and excepting a few old city friends whom to $lady_middleton$ regret she had never dropped she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions
pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected $elinor$ was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties which whether at home or abroad formed only for cards could have little to amuse her
colonel $mrs_brandon$ who had a general invitation to the #house# was with them almost every #day# he came to look at $marianne_dashwood$ and talk to $elinor$ who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence but who saw at the same #time# with much concern his continued regard for her #sister#
every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere the certain symptoms of approaching frost she feared it was a strengthening regard
it grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched $marianne_dashwood$ and his spirits were certainly worse than when at $barton$
about a week after their arrival it became certain that $mrs_willoughby$ was also arrived his card was on the table when they came in from the morning drive
$elinor$ rejoiced to be assured of his being in london now ventured to say depend upon it he #will# call again tomorrow
good god cried $marianne_dashwood$ he has been here while we were out but $marianne_dashwood$ seemed hardly to hear her and on $mrs_jennings$ entrance escaped with the precious card
this event while it raised the spirits of $elinor$ restored to those of her #sister# all and more than all their former agitation
from this moment her mind was never quiet the expectation of seeing him every hour of the #day# made her unfit for any #thing#
$elinor$ thoughts were full of what might be passing in berkeley street during their absence but a moment glance at her #sister# when they returned was enough to inform her that $mrs_willoughby$ had paid no second visit there
she insisted on being left behind the next morning when the others went out a note was just then brought in and laid on the table
for me cried $marianne_dashwood$ stepping hastily forward no ma am for my mistress but $marianne_dashwood$ not convinced took it instantly up
it is indeed for $mrs_jennings$ how provoking you are expecting a #letter# then said $elinor$ unable to be longer silent
yes a little not much after a short pause you have no confidence in me $marianne_dashwood$ nay $elinor$ this reproach from you you who have confidence in no one
me returned $elinor$ in some confusion indeed $marianne_dashwood$ i have #nothing# to tell nor i answered $marianne_dashwood$ with energy our situations then are alike
we have neither of us any #thing# to tell you because you do not communicate and i because i conceal #nothing#
$elinor$ distressed by this charge of reserve in herself which she was not at liberty to do away knew not how under such circumstances to press for greater openness in $marianne_dashwood$
it was from $lady_middleton$ announcing their arrival in conduit street the night before and requesting the company of her #mother# and cousins the following evening
$mrs_jennings$ soon appeared and the note being given her she read it aloud business on sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ part and a violent cold on her own prevented their calling in berkeley street
the invitation was accepted but when the hour of appointment drew near necessary as it was in common civility to $mrs_jennings$ that they should both attend her on such a visit $elinor$ had some difficulty in persuading her #sister# to go for still she had seen #nothing# of $mrs_willoughby$ and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence
$elinor$ found when the evening was over that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode for although scarcely settled in town sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ had contrived to collect around him nearly twenty young people and to amuse them with a ball
in the country an unpremeditated dance was very allowable but in london where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained it was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls to have it known that $lady_middleton$ had given a small dance of eight or nine couple with two violins and a mere side board collation
mr and $mrs_palmer$ were of the party from the former whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his #mother# in law and therefore never came near her they received no mark of recognition on their entrance
he looked at them slightly without seeming to know who they were and merely nodded to $mrs_jennings$ from the other side of the room
this was an affair however of which $lady_middleton$ did not approve $marianne_dashwood$ gave one glance round the apartment as she entered it was enough
after they had been assembled about an hour mr $mrs_palmer$ sauntered towards the miss dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town though colonel $mrs_brandon$ had been first informed of their arrival at his #house# and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come
he was not there and she sat down equally ill disposed to receive or communicate pleasure i thought you were both in devonshire said he
did you replied $elinor$ when do you go back again i do not know and thus ended their discourse
never had $marianne_dashwood$ been so unwilling to dance in her life as she was that evening and never so much fatigued by the exercise
aye aye said $mrs_jennings$ we know the reason of all that very well if a certain person who shall be nameless had been there you would not have been a bit tired and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited
she complained of it as they returned to berkeley street invited cried $marianne_dashwood$ so my daughter $lady_middleton$ told me for it seems sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ met him somewhere in the street this morning
impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her #sister# relief $elinor$ resolved to write the next morning to her #mother# and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of $marianne_dashwood$ to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow that $marianne_dashwood$ was again writing to $mrs_willoughby$ for she could not suppose it to be to any other person
about the middle of the #day# $mrs_jennings$ went out by herself on business and $elinor$ began her #letter# directly while $marianne_dashwood$ too restless for employment too anxious for conversation walked from one window to the other or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation
$elinor$ was very earnest in her application to her #mother# relating all that had passed her suspicions of $mrs_willoughby$ inconstancy urging her by every plea of #duty# and affection to demand from $marianne_dashwood$ an account of her real situation with respect to him
$marianne_dashwood$ said no more but looked exceedingly hurt her #letter# was scarcely finished when a rap foretold a #visitor# and colonel $mrs_brandon$ was announced
$marianne_dashwood$ who had seen him from the window and who hated company of any kind left the room before he entered it
he looked more than usually grave and though expressing satisfaction at finding miss $marianne_dashwood$ alone as if he had somewhat in particular to tell her sat for some #time# without saying a word
it was not the first #time# of her feeling the same kind of conviction for more than once before beginning with the observation of your #sister# looks unwell to #day# or your #sister# seems out of spirits he had appeared on the point either of disclosing or of inquiring something particular about her
after a pause of several minutes their silence was broken by his asking her in a voice of some agitation when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother
$elinor$ was not prepared for such a question and having no answer ready was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient of asking what he meant
$elinor$ persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her #sister# was concerned impatiently expected its opening he tried to smile as he replied your #sister# engagement to mr $mrs_willoughby$ is very generally known
he looked surprised and said i beg your pardon i am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent but i had not supposed any secrecy intended as they openly correspond and their marriage is universally talked of
it cannot be generally known returned $elinor$ for her own family do not know it how can that be by whom can you have heard it mentioned
by many by some of whom you know #nothing# by others with whom you are most intimate $mrs_jennings$ $mrs_palmer$ and the $middletons$
but still i might not have believed it for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced it #will# always find something to support its doubts if i had not when the servant let me in today accidentally seen a #letter# in his hand directed to mr $mrs_willoughby$ in your #sister# writing
i came to inquire but i was convinced before i could ask the question is every #thing# finally settled is it impossible to
i believe i have been wrong in saying so much but i hardly know what to do and on your prudence i have the strongest dependence
tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on that any attempt that in short concealment if concealment be possible is all that remains
but i have no right and i could have no chance of succeeding excuse me miss $marianne_dashwood$ these words which conveyed to $elinor$ a direct avowal of his love for her #sister# affected her very much
she was not immediately able to say anything and even when her spirits were recovered she debated for a short #time# on the answer it would be most proper to give
the real state of #thing# between $mrs_willoughby$ and her #sister# was so little known to herself that in endeavouring to explain it she might be as liable to say too much as too little
yet as she was convinced that $marianne_dashwood$ affection for $mrs_willoughby$ could leave no hope of colonel $mrs_brandon$ success whatever the event of that affection might be and at the same #time# wished to shield her conduct from censure she thought it most prudent and kind after some consideration to say more than she really knew or believed
she acknowledged therefore that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other of their mutual affection
he listened to her with silent attention and on her ceasing to speak rose directly from his seat and after saying in a voice of emotion to your #sister# i #wish# all imaginable happiness to $mrs_willoughby$ that he may endeavour to deserve her took leave and went away
$elinor$ derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points she was left on the contrary with a melancholy impression of colonel $mrs_brandon$ unhappiness and was prevented even from wishing it removed by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it
#nothing# occurred during the next three or four #day# to make $elinor$ regret what she had done in applying to her #mother# for $mrs_willoughby$ neither came nor wrote
they were engaged about the end of that #time# to attend $lady_middleton$ to a party from which $mrs_jennings$ was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter and for this party $marianne_dashwood$ wholly dispirited careless of her appearance and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid prepared without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure
she sat by the drawing room fire after tea till the moment of $lady_middleton$ arrival without once stirring from her seat or altering her attitude lost in her own thoughts and insensible of her #sister# presence and when at last they were told that $lady_middleton$ waited for them at the door she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected
they arrived in due #time# at the place of destination and as soon as the string of carriages before them would allow alighted ascended the stairs heard their names announced from one landing place to another in an audible voice and entered a room splendidly lit up quite full of company and insufferably hot
when they had paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the #lady# of the #house# they were permitted to mingle in the crowd and take their share of the heat and inconvenience to which their arrival must necessarily add
after some #time# spent in saying little or doing less $lady_middleton$ sat down to cassino and as $marianne_dashwood$ was not in spirits for moving about she and $elinor$ luckily succeeding to chairs placed themselves at no great distance from the table
they had not remained in this manner long before $elinor$ perceived $mrs_willoughby$ standing within a few yards of them in earnest conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman
she soon caught his eye and he immediately bowed but without attempting to speak to her or to approach $marianne_dashwood$ though he could not but see her and then continued his discourse with the same #lady#
she had no doubt and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear chapter $elinor$ turned involuntarily to $marianne_dashwood$ to see whether it could be unobserved by her
at that moment she first perceived him and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight she would have moved towards him instantly had not her #sister# caught hold of her
good heavens she exclaimed he is there he is there oh why does he not look at me why cannot i speak to him
pray pray be composed cried $elinor$ and do not betray what you feel to every body present perhaps he has not observed you yet
this however was more than she could believe herself and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of $marianne_dashwood$
at last he turned round again and regarded them both she started up and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection held out her hand to him
he approached and addressing himself rather to $elinor$ than $marianne_dashwood$ as if wishing to avoid her eye and determined not to observe her attitude inquired in a hurried manner after mrs $marianne_dashwood$ and asked how long they had been in town
it was beyond her #wish# she sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature $elinor$ was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address and was unable to say a word
but the feelings of her #sister# were instantly expressed her face was crimsoned over and she exclaimed in a voice of the greatest emotion good god
$mrs_willoughby$ what is the meaning of this have you not received my #letter# #will# you not shake hands with me
he could not then avoid it but her touch seemed painful to him and he held her hand only for a moment
during all this #time# he was evidently struggling for composure $elinor$ watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil
i did myself the honour of calling in berkeley street last tuesday and very much regretted that i was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and $mrs_jennings$ at home
after a moment pause he spoke with calmness my card was not lost i hope but have you not received my notes
cried $marianne_dashwood$ in the wildest anxiety here is some mistake i am sure some dreadful mistake what can be the meaning of it
he made no reply his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned but as if on catching the eye of the young #lady# with whom he had been previously talking he felt the necessity of instant exertion he recovered himself again and after saying yes i had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so good as to send me turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined his friend
$marianne_dashwood$ now looking dreadfully white and unable to stand sunk into her chair and $elinor$ expecting every moment to see her faint tried to screen her from the observation of others while reviving her with lavender water
tell me $mrs_willoughby$ for heaven #sake# tell me what is the matter go to him $elinor$ she cried as soon as she could speak and force him to come to me
tell him i must see him again must speak to him instantly i cannot rest i shall not have a moment peace till this is explained some dreadful misapprehension or
other oh go to him this moment how can that be done no my dearest $marianne_dashwood$ you must wait this is not the place for explanations
with difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself and to persuade her to check her agitation to wait at least with the appearance of composure till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect was impossible for $marianne_dashwood$ continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings by exclamations of wretchedness
in a short #time# $elinor$ saw $mrs_willoughby$ quit the room by the door towards the staircase and telling $marianne_dashwood$ that he was gone urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening as a fresh argument for her to be calm
she instantly begged her #sister# would entreat $lady_middleton$ to take them home as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer
$lady_middleton$ though in the middle of a rubber on being informed that $marianne_dashwood$ was unwell was too polite to object for a moment to her #wish# of going away and making over her cards to a friend they departed as soon the carriage could be found
$marianne_dashwood$ was in a silent agony too much oppressed even for tears but as $mrs_jennings$ was luckily not come home they could go directly to their own room where hartshorn restored her a little to herself
she was soon undressed and in bed and as she seemed desirous of being alone her #sister# then left her and while she waited the return of $mrs_jennings$ had leisure enough for thinking over the past
that some kind of engagement had subsisted between $mrs_willoughby$ and $marianne_dashwood$ she could not doubt and that $mrs_willoughby$ was weary of it seemed equally clear for however $marianne_dashwood$ might still feed her own #wish# she could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or misapprehension of any kind
wait only till tomorrow scarcely a word was spoken during their return to berkeley street #nothing# but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it
her indignation would have been still stronger than it was had she not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct and prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the affections of her #sister# from the first without any design that would bear investigation
absence might have weakened his regard and convenience might have determined him to overcome it but that such a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt
as for $marianne_dashwood$ on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already have given her and on those still more severe which might await her in its probable consequence she could not reflect without the deepest concern
her own situation gained in the comparison for while she could esteem $mr_edward_ferrars$ as much as ever however they might be divided in future her mind might be always supported
but every circumstance that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery of $marianne_dashwood$ in a final separation from $mrs_willoughby$ in an immediate and irreconcilable rupture with him
before the #house# maid had lit their fire the next #day# or the sun gained any power over a cold gloomy morning in january $marianne_dashwood$ only #half# dressed was kneeling against one of the window seats for the #sake# of all the little light she could command from it and writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her
in this situation $elinor$ roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs first perceived her and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety said in a tone of the most considerate gentleness $marianne_dashwood$ may i ask
the sort of desperate calmness with which this was said lasted no longer than while she spoke and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction
it was some minutes before she could go on with her #letter# and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her at intervals to withhold her pen were proofs enough of her feeling
chapter no $elinor$ she replied ask #nothing# you #will# soon know all how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last #time# to $mrs_willoughby$
$elinor$ paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more had not $marianne_dashwood$ entreated her with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability not to speak to her for the world
in such circumstances it was better for both that they should not be long together and the restless state of $marianne_dashwood$ mind not only prevented her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place made her wander about the #house# till breakfast #time# avoiding the sight of every body
at breakfast she neither ate nor attempted to eat any #thing# and $elinor$ attention was then all employed not in urging her not in pitying her nor in appearing to regard her but in endeavouring to engage $mrs_jennings$ notice entirely to herself
as this was a favourite meal with $mrs_jennings$ it lasted a considerable #time# and they were just setting themselves after it round the common working table when a #letter# was delivered to $marianne_dashwood$ which she eagerly caught from the servant and turning of a death like paleness instantly ran out of the room
$elinor$ who saw as plainly by this as if she had seen the direction that it must come from $mrs_willoughby$ felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape $mrs_jennings$ notice
that good #lady# however saw only that $marianne_dashwood$ had received a #letter# from $mrs_willoughby$ which appeared to her a very good joke and which she treated accordingly by hoping with a laugh that she would find it to her liking
of $elinor$ distress she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug to see any #thing# at all and calmly continuing her talk as soon as $marianne_dashwood$ disappeared she said upon my word i never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life
my girls were #nothing# to her and yet they used to be foolish enough but as for miss $marianne_dashwood$ she is quite an altered creature
i hope from the bottom of my heart he wont keep her waiting much longer for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn
$elinor$ though never less disposed to speak than at that moment obliged herself to answer such an attack as this and therefore trying to smile replied and have you really ma am talked yourself into a persuasion of my #sister# being engaged to mr $mrs_willoughby$
i thought it had been only a joke but so serious a question seems to imply more and i must beg therefore that you #will# not deceive yourself any longer
pray when are they to be married i do assure you that #nothing# would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married
dont we all know that it must be a match that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met
did not i see them together in devonshire every #day# and all #day# long and did not i know that your #sister# came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes
because you are so sly about it yourself you think nobody else has any #sense# but it is no such #thing# i can tell you for it has been known all over town this ever so long
for shame for shame miss $marianne_dashwood$ how can you talk so come come this wont do i tell every body of it and so does charlotte
indeed you are doing a very unkind #thing# in spreading the report and you #will# find that you have though you #will# not believe me now
$mrs_jennings$ laughed again but $elinor$ had not spirits to say more and eager at all events to know what $mrs_willoughby$ had written hurried away to their room where on opening the door she saw $marianne_dashwood$ stretched on the bed almost choked by grief one #letter# in her hand and two or three others laying by her
$elinor$ drew near but without saying a word and seating herself on the bed took her hand kissed her affectionately several #time# and then gave way to a burst of tears which at first was scarcely less violent than $marianne_dashwood$
the latter though unable to speak seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour and after some #time# thus spent in joint affliction she put all the #letter# into $elinor$ hands and then covering her face with her handkerchief almost screamed with agony
$elinor$ who knew that such grief shocking as it was to witness it must have its course watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself and then turning eagerly to $mrs_willoughby$ #letter# read as follows bond street january
my dear madam i have just had the honour of receiving your #letter# for which i beg to return my sincere acknowledgments
i am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation and though i am quite at a loss to discover in what point i could be so unfortunate as to offend you i entreat your forgiveness of what i can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional
i shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in devonshire without the most grateful pleasure and flatter myself it #will# not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions
my esteem for your whole family is very sincere but if i have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than i felt or meant to express i shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem
that i should ever have meant more you #will# allow to be impossible when you understand that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere and it #will# not be many weeks i believe before this engagement is fulfilled
it is with great regret that i obey your commands in returning the #letter# with which i have been honoured from you and the lock of hair which you so obligingly bestowed on me
indeed ma am said $elinor$ very seriously you are mistaken i am dear madam your most obedient humble servant $mrs_john_dashwood$ $mrs_willoughby$
though aware before she began it that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy and confirm their separation for ever she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it nor could she have supposed $mrs_willoughby$ capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling so far from the common decorum of a gentleman as to send a #letter# so impudently cruel a #letter# which instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret acknowledged no breach of faith denied all peculiar affection
with what indignation such a #letter# as this must be read by miss $marianne_dashwood$ may be imagined whatever a #letter# of which every line was an insult and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy
she paused over it for some #time# with indignant astonishment then read it again and again but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the #man# and so bitter were her feelings against him that she dared not trust herself to speak lest she might wound $marianne_dashwood$ still deeper by treating their disengagement not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils a connection for life with an unprincipled #man# as a deliverance the most real a blessing the most important
in her earnest meditations on the contents of the #letter# on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it and probably on the very different mind of a very different person who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every #thing# that passed $elinor$ forgot the immediate distress of her #sister# forgot that she had three #letter# on her lap yet unread and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early she was all astonishment to perceive $mrs_jennings$ chariot which she knew had not been ordered till one
determined not to quit $marianne_dashwood$ though hopeless of contributing at present to her ease she hurried away to excuse herself from attending $mrs_jennings$ on account of her #sister# being indisposed
$mrs_jennings$ with a thoroughly good humoured concern for its cause admitted the excuse most readily and $elinor$ after seeing her safe off returned to $marianne_dashwood$ whom she found attempting to rise from the bed and whom she reached just in #time# to prevent her from falling on the floor faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food for it was many #day# since she had any appetite and many nights since she had really slept and now when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head a weakened stomach and a general nervous faintness
a glass of wine which $elinor$ procured for her directly made her more comfortable and she was at last able to express some #sense# of her kindness by saying poor $elinor$
how unhappy i make you i only #wish# replied her #sister# there were any #thing# i could do which might be of comfort to you
this as every #thing# else would have been was too much for $marianne_dashwood$ who could only exclaim in the anguish of her heart oh
$elinor$ i am miserable indeed before her voice was entirely lost in sobs $elinor$ could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence
exert yourself dear $marianne_dashwood$ she cried if you would not kill yourself and all who love you think of your #mother# think of her misery while you suffer for her #sake# you must exert yourself
i cannot i cannot cried $marianne_dashwood$ leave me leave me if i distress you leave me hate me forget me but do not torture me so
oh how easy for those who have no #sorrow# of their own to talk of exertion happy happy $elinor$ you cannot have an idea of what i suffer
do you call me happy $marianne_dashwood$ ah if you knew and can you believe me to be so while i see you so wretched
forgive me forgive me throwing her arms round her #sister# neck i know you feel for me i know what a heart you have but
yet you are you must be happy $mr_edward_ferrars$ loves you what oh what can do away such happiness as that many many circumstances said $elinor$ solemnly
no no no cried $marianne_dashwood$ wildly he loves you and only you you can have no grief i can have no pleasure while i see you in this state
and you #will# never see me otherwise mine is a misery which #nothing# can do away you must not talk so $marianne_dashwood$
much as you suffer now think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period if your engagement had been carried on for #month# and #month# as it might have been before he chose to put an end to it
have you no comforts no friends is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation every additional #day# of unhappy confidence on your side would have made the blow more dreadful
engagement cried $marianne_dashwood$ there has been no engagement no engagement no he is not so unworthy as you believe him
he has broken no faith with me but he told you that he loved you yes no never absolutely it was every #day# implied but never professedly declared
sometimes i thought it had been but it never was yet you wrote to him yes could that be wrong after all that had passed
$elinor$ said no more and turning again to the three #letter# which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before directly ran over the contents of all
but i cannot talk the first which was what her #sister# had sent him on their arrival in town was to this effect
how surprised you #will# be $mrs_willoughby$ on receiving this and i think you #will# feel something more than surprise when you know that i am in town
berkeley street january an opportunity of coming hither though with $mrs_jennings$ was a temptation we could not resist i #wish# you may receive this in #time# to come here to night but i #will# not depend on it
at any rate i shall expect you to morrow for the present adieu d her second note which had been written on the morning after the dance at the $middletons$ was in these words
i cannot express my disappointment in having missed you the #day# before yesterday nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which i sent you above a week ago
i have been expecting to hear from you and still more to see you every hour of the #day# pray call again as soon as possible and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain
you had better come earlier another #time# because we are generally out by one we were last night at $lady_middleton$ where there was a dance
i have been told that you were asked to be of the party but could it be so you must be very much altered indeed since we parted if that could be the case and you not there
but i #will# not suppose this possible and i hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise
d the contents of her last note to him were these what am i to imagine $mrs_willoughby$ by your behaviour last night
i was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced with the familiarity which our intimacy at $barton$ appeared to me to justify
i have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting but though i have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour i am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it
again i demand an explanation of it i was repulsed indeed you have perhaps been misinformed or purposely deceived in something concerning me which may have lowered me in your opinion
tell me what it is explain the grounds on which you acted and i shall be satisfied in being able to satisfy you
it would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you but if i am to do it if i am to learn that you are not what we have
hitherto believed you that your regard for us all was insincere that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive let it be told as soon as possible
my feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision i #wish# to acquit you but certainty on either side #will# be ease to what i now suffer
if your sentiments are no longer what they were you #will# return my notes and the lock of my hair which is in your possession
that such #letter# so full of affection and confidence could have been so answered $elinor$ for $mrs_willoughby$ #sake# would have been unwilling to believe
but her condemnation of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their having been written at all and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs of tenderness not warranted by anything preceding and most severely condemned by the event when $marianne_dashwood$ perceiving that she had finished the #letter# observed to her that they contained #nothing#
i felt myself she added to be as solemnly engaged to him as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other
d but what any one would have written in the same situation i can believe it said $elinor$ but unfortunately he did not feel the same
he did feel the same $elinor$ for weeks and weeks he felt it i know he did whatever may have changed him now and #nothing# but
the blackest art employed against me can have done it i was once as dear to him as my own soul could #wish#
this lock of hair which now he can so readily give up was begged of me with the most earnest supplication
had you seen his look his manner had you heard his voice at that moment have you forgot the last evening of our being together at $barton$
the morning that we parted too when he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again his distress can i ever forget his distress
for a moment or two she could say no more but when this emotion had passed away she added in a firmer tone $elinor$ i have been cruelly used but not by $mrs_willoughby$
dearest $marianne_dashwood$ who but himself by whom can he have been instigated by all the world rather than by his own heart
i could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion than believe his nature capable of such cruelty
this woman of whom he writes whoever she be or any one in short but your own dear self mama and $mr_edward_ferrars$ may have been so barbarous to bely me
beyond you three is there a creature in the world whom i would not rather suspect of evil than $mrs_willoughby$ whose heart i know so well
$elinor$ would not contend and only replied whoever may have been so detestably your enemy let them be cheated of their malignant triumph my dear #sister# by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits
it is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence no no cried $marianne_dashwood$ misery such as mine has no pride
i care not who knows that i am wretched the triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world
$elinor$ $elinor$ they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like may resist insult or return mortification but i cannot
i must feel i must be wretched and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can but for my #mother# #sake# and mine i would do more than for my own
$elinor$ was employed in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window from the window to the fire without knowing that she received warmth from one or discerning objects through the other and $marianne_dashwood$ seated at the foot of the bed with her head leaning against one of its posts again took up $mrs_willoughby$ #letter# and after shuddering over every sentence exclaimed it is too much
but to appear happy when i am so miserable oh who can require it again they were both silent oh $mrs_willoughby$ willoughby could this be yours
cruel cruel #nothing# can acquit you $elinor$ #nothing# can whatever he might have heard against me ought he not to have suspended his belief
ought he not to have told me of it to have given me the power of clearing myself the lock of hair repeating it from the #letter# which you so obligingly bestowed on me that is unpardonable
$mrs_willoughby$ where was your heart when you wrote those words oh barbarously insolent $elinor$ can he be justified no $marianne_dashwood$ in no possible way
and yet this woman who knows what her art may have been how long it may have been premeditated and how deeply contrived by her who is she who
can she be whom did i ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance oh no one no one
he talked to me only of myself another pause ensued $marianne_dashwood$ was greatly agitated and it ended thus $elinor$ i must go home
i must go and comfort mama can not we be gone to morrow to morrow $marianne_dashwood$ yes why should i stay here i came only for $mrs_willoughby$ #sake# and now who cares for me
we owe $mrs_jennings$ much more than civility and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that
well then another #day# or two perhaps but i cannot stay here long i cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people
who regards me it would be impossible to go to morrow the $middletons$ and palmers how am i to bear their pity
$elinor$ advised her to lie down again and for a moment she did so but no attitude could give her ease and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another till growing more and more hysterical her #sister# could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all and for some #time# was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance
some lavender drops however which she was at length persuaded to take were of use and from that #time# till $mrs_jennings$ returned she continued on the bed quiet and motionless
$mrs_jennings$ came immediately to their room on her return and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern
the pity of such a woman as $lady_middleton$ oh what would he say to that chapter how do you do my dear said
she in a voice of great compassion to $marianne_dashwood$ who turned away her face without attempting to answer how is she miss $marianne_dashwood$ poor #thing#
she looks very bad no wonder ay it is but too true he is to be married very soon a good for #nothing# fellow
mrs taylor told me of it #half# an hour ago and she was told it by a particular friend of miss grey herself else i am sure i should not have believed it and i was almost ready to sink as it was
well said i all i can say is that if this be true he has used a young #lady# of my acquaintance abominably ill and i #wish# with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out
i have no notion of #man# going on in this way and if ever i meet him again i #will# give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a #day#
but there is one comfort my dear miss $marianne_dashwood$ he is not the only young #man# in the world worth having and with your pretty face you #will# never want admirers
i have no patience with him and so i shall always say my dear you may depend on it well poor #thing#
i wont disturb her any longer for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with the parrys and sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know and that #will# amuse her
she then went away walking on tiptoe out of the room as if she supposed her young friend affliction could be increased by noise
$marianne_dashwood$ to the surprise of her #sister# determined on dining with them $elinor$ even advised her against it but no she would go down she could bear it very well and the bustle about her would be less
$elinor$ pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner said no more and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could while $marianne_dashwood$ still remained on the bed was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it
had she tried to speak or had she been conscious of #half# $mrs_jennings$ well meant but ill judged attentions to her this calmness could not have been maintained but not a syllable escaped her lips and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every #thing# that was passing before her
$elinor$ who did justice to $mrs_jennings$ kindness though its effusions were often distressing and sometimes almost ridiculous made her those acknowledgments and returned her those civilities which her #sister# could not make or return for herself
their good friend saw that $marianne_dashwood$ was unhappy and felt that every #thing# was due to her which might make her at all less so
she treated her therefore with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last #day# of its holidays
$marianne_dashwood$ was to have the best place by the fire was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the #house# and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the #day#
had not $elinor$ in the sad countenance of her #sister# seen a check to all mirth she could have been entertained by $mrs_jennings$ endeavours to cure a disappointment in love by a variety of sweetmeats and olives and a good fire
as soon however as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on $marianne_dashwood$ she could stay no longer
with a hasty exclamation of misery and a sign to her #sister# not to follow her she directly got up and hurried out of the room
when there though looking most wretchedly she ate more and was calmer than her #sister# had expected poor soul cried $mrs_jennings$ as soon as she was gone how it grieves me to see her
and i declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine and the dried cherries too lord #nothing# seems to do her any good
i am sure if i knew of any #thing# she would like i would send all over the town for it
well it is the oddest #thing# to me that a #man# should use such a pretty girl so ill but when there is plenty of money on one side and next to none on the other lord bless you
they care no more about such #thing# the #lady# then miss grey i think you called her is very rich fifty thousand pounds my dear
did you ever see her a smart stylish girl they say but not handsome i remember her aunt very well biddy henshawe she married a very wealthy #man#
but the family are all rich together fifty thousand pounds and by all accounts it wont come before it wanted for they say he is all to pieces
well it dont signify talking but when a young #man# be who he #will# comes and makes love to a pretty girl and promises marriage he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor and a richer girl is ready to have him
why dont he in such a case sell his horses let his #house# turn off his servants and make a thorough reform at once
no wonder dashing about with his curricle and hunters i warrant you miss $marianne_dashwood$ would have been ready to wait till matters came round
but that wont do now a #day# #nothing# in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young #man# of this age
i never heard any harm of her indeed i hardly ever heard her mentioned except that mrs taylor did say this morning that one #day# miss walker hinted to her that she believed mr and mrs ellison would not be sorry to have miss grey married for she and mrs ellison could never agree
do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is is she said to be amiable and who are the ellisons
but now she is of age and may choose for herself and a pretty choice she has made what now after pausing a moment your poor #sister# is gone to her own room i suppose to moan by herself
her guardians my dear is there #nothing# one can get to comfort her poor dear it seems quite cruel to let her be alone
well by and by we shall have a few friends and that #will# amuse her a little what shall we play at she hates whist i know but is there no round game she cares for
dear ma am this kindness is quite unnecessary $marianne_dashwood$ i dare say #will# not leave her room again this evening
i shall persuade her if i can to go early to bed for i am sure she wants rest aye i believe that #will# be best for her
no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two for this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that
let her name her own supper and go to bed lord and so the #letter# that came today finished it poor soul
i am sure if i had had a notion of it i would not have joked her about it for all my money
i made sure of its being #nothing# but a common love #letter# and you know young people like to be laughed at about them
but then you know how should i guess such a #thing# lord how concerned sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ and my daughters #will# be when they hear it
if i had my #sense# about me i might have called in conduit street in my way home and told them of it
i am sure for you to caution $mrs_palmer$ and sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ against ever naming mr $mrs_willoughby$ or making the slightest allusion to what has passed before my #sister#
their own good nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any #thing# about it when she is present and the less that may ever be said to myself on the #subject# the more my feelings #will# be spared as you my dear madam #will# easily believe
it must be terrible for you to hear it talked of and as for your #sister# i am sure i would not mention a word about it to her for the world
but i shall see them tomorrow it would be unnecessary oh lord yes that i do indeed you saw i did not all dinner #time#
no more would sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ nor my daughters for they are all very thoughtful and considerate especially if i give them a hint as i certainly #will#
for my part i think the less that is said about such #thing# the better the sooner tis blown over and forgot
in this affair it can only do harm more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind for it has been attended by circumstances which for the #sake# of every one concerned in it make it unfit to become the public conversation
and what does talking ever do you know i must do this justice to mr $mrs_willoughby$ he has broken no positive engagement with my #sister#
law my dear dont pretend to defend him no positive engagement indeed after taking her all over allenham #house# and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter
$elinor$ for her #sister# #sake# could not press the #subject# farther and she hoped it was not required of her for $mrs_willoughby$ since though $marianne_dashwood$ might lose much he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth
after a short silence on both sides $mrs_jennings$ with all her natural hilarity burst forth again well my dear tis a true saying about an ill wind for it #will# be all the better for colonel $mrs_brandon$
he #will# have her at last aye that he #will# mind me now if they ant married by mid summer lord how he ll chuckle over this news
two thousand a year without debt or drawback except the little love child indeed aye i had forgot her but she may be prenticed out at a small cost and then what does it signify
delaford is a nice place i can tell you exactly what i call a nice old fashioned place full of comforts and conveniences quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit trees in the country and such a mulberry tree in one corner
i hope he #will# come tonight it #will# be all to one a better match for your #sister# lord how charlotte and i did stuff the only #time# we were there
then there is a dove cote some delightful stew ponds and a very pretty canal and every #thing# in short that one could #wish# for and moreover it is close to the church and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike road so tis never dull for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the #house# you may see all the carriages that pass along
to my fancy a thousand #time# prettier than $barton$ park where they are forced to send three miles for their meat and have not a neighbour nearer than your #mother#
oh tis a nice place a butcher hard by in the village and the parsonage #house# within a stone throw well i shall spirit up the colonel as soon as i can
one shoulder of mutton you know drives another down if we can but put $mrs_willoughby$ out of her head ay if we can do that ma am said $elinor$ we shall do very well with or without colonel $mrs_brandon$
and then rising she went away to join $marianne_dashwood$ whom she found as she expected in her own room leaning in silent misery over the small remains of a fire which till $elinor$ entrance had been her only light
you had better leave me was all the notice that her #sister# received from her i #will# leave you said $elinor$ if you #will# go to bed
her #sister# earnest though gentle persuasion however soon softened her to compliance and $elinor$ saw her lay her aching head on the pillow and as she hoped in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her
in the drawing room whither she then repaired she was soon joined by $mrs_jennings$ with a wine glass full of something in her hand
my dear said she entering i have just recollected that i have some of the finest old constantia wine in the #house# that ever was tasted so i have brought a glass of it for your #sister#
but this from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering she at first refused to do my poor husband how fond he was of it
whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout he said it did him more good than any #thing# else in the world
do take it to your #sister# dear ma am replied $elinor$ smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended how good you are
but i have just left $marianne_dashwood$ in bed and i hope almost asleep and as i think #nothing# #will# be of so much service to her as rest if you #will# give me leave i #will# drink the wine myself
$mrs_jennings$ though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier was satisfied with the compromise and $elinor$ as she swallowed the chief of it reflected that though its effects on a colicky gout were at present of little importance to her its healing powers on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her #sister#
colonel $mrs_brandon$ came in while the party were at tea and by his manner of looking round the room for $marianne_dashwood$ $elinor$ immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see her there and in short that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence
$mrs_jennings$ was not struck by the same thought for soon after his entrance she walked across the room to the tea table where $elinor$ presided and whispered
the colonel looks as grave as ever you see he knows #nothing# of it do tell him my dear
he shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers and with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information inquired after her #sister#
$marianne_dashwood$ is not well said she she has been indisposed all #day# and we have persuaded her to go to bed
perhaps then he hesitatingly replied what i heard this morning may be there may be more truth in it than i could believe possible at first
that a gentleman whom i had reason to think in short that a #man# whom i knew to be engaged but how shall i tell you
what did you hear if you know it already as surely you must i may be spared you mean answered $elinor$ with forced calmness mr $mrs_willoughby$ marriage with miss grey
yes we do know it all this seems to have been a #day# of general elucidation for this very morning first unfolded it to us
two #lady# were waiting for their carriage and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match in a voice so little attempting concealment that it was impossible for me not to hear all
the name of $mrs_willoughby$ $mrs_john_dashwood$ $mrs_willoughby$ frequently repeated first caught my attention and what followed was a positive assertion that every #thing# was now finally settled respecting his marriage with miss grey
it was no longer to be a secret it would take place even within a few weeks with many particulars of preparations and other matters
one #thing# especially i remember because it served to identify the #man# still more as soon as the ceremony was over they were to go to $combe_magna$ his seat in somersetshire
mr $mrs_willoughby$ is unfathomable where did you hear it in a stationer shop in pall mall where i had business my
the communicative #lady# i learnt on inquiry for i stayed in the shop till they were gone was a mrs ellison and that as i have been since informed is the name of miss grey guardian
astonishment but it would be impossible to describe what i felt it is but have you likewise heard that miss grey has fifty thousand pounds
it may be so but $mrs_willoughby$ is capable at least i think he stopped a moment then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself and your #sister# how did she
in that if in any #thing# we may find an explanation her sufferings have been very severe i have only to hope that they may be proportionately short
till yesterday i believe she never doubted his regard and even now perhaps but i am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her
it has been it is a most cruel affliction he has been very deceitful and in some points there seems a hardness of heart about him
ah said colonel $mrs_brandon$ there is indeed but your #sister# does not i think you said so she does not consider quite as you do
he made no answer and soon afterwards by the removal of the tea #thing# and the arrangement of the card parties the #subject# was necessarily dropped
$mrs_jennings$ who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking and who expected to see the effect of miss $marianne_dashwood$ communication in such an instantaneous gaiety on colonel $mrs_brandon$ side as might have become a #man# in the bloom of youth of hope and happiness saw him with amazement remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual
from a night of more sleep than she had expected $marianne_dashwood$ awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes
$elinor$ encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt and before breakfast was ready they had gone through the #subject# again and again and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on $elinor$ side the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on $marianne_dashwood$ as before
sometimes she could believe $mrs_willoughby$ to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself and at others lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him
at one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world at another she would seclude herself from it for ever and at a third could resist it with energy
in one #thing# however she was uniform when it came to the point in avoiding where it was possible the presence of $mrs_jennings$ and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it
you know her disposition and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could chapter her heart was hardened against the belief of $mrs_jennings$ entering into her #sorrow# with any compassion
no no no it cannot be she cried she cannot feel her kindness is not sympathy her good nature is not tenderness
$elinor$ had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her #sister# was often led in her opinion of others by the irritable refinement of her own mind and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a strong sensibility and the graces of a polished manner
like #half# the rest of the world if more than #half# there be that are clever and good $marianne_dashwood$ with excellent abilities and an excellent disposition was neither reasonable nor candid
she expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself
thus a circumstance occurred while the #sister# were together in their own room after breakfast which sunk the heart of $mrs_jennings$ still lower in her estimation because through her own weakness it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself though $mrs_jennings$ was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill
with a #letter# in her outstretched hand and countenance gaily smiling from the persuasion of bringing comfort she entered their room saying now my dear i bring you something that i am sure #will# do you good
all that she wants is gossip and she only likes me now because i supply it $marianne_dashwood$ heard enough
in one moment her imagination placed before her a #letter# from $mrs_willoughby$ full of tenderness and contrition explanatory of all that had passed satisfactory convincing and instantly followed by $mrs_willoughby$ himself rushing eagerly into the room to inforce at her feet by the eloquence of his eyes the assurances of his #letter#
the hand writing of her #mother# never till then unwelcome was before her and in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope she felt as if till that instant she had never suffered
the cruelty of $mrs_jennings$ no language within her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence could have expressed and now she could reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence a reproach however so entirely lost on its object that after many expressions of pity she withdrew still referring her to the #letter# of comfort
the work of one moment was destroyed by the next but the #letter# when she was calm enough to read it brought little comfort
her #mother# still confident of their engagement and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy had only been roused by $elinor$ application to intreat from $marianne_dashwood$ greater openness towards them both and this with such tenderness towards her such affection for $mrs_willoughby$ and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other that she wept with agony through the whole of it
all her impatience to be at home again now returned her #mother# was dearer to her than ever dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in $mrs_willoughby$ and she was wildly urgent to be gone
$elinor$ unable herself to determine whether it were better for $marianne_dashwood$ to be in london or at $barton$ offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their #mother# #wish# could be known and at length she obtained her #sister# consent to wait for that #knowledge#
$mrs_jennings$ left them earlier than usual for she could not be easy till the $middletons$ and palmers were able to grieve as much as herself and positively refusing $elinor$ offered attendance went out alone for the rest of the morning
$elinor$ with a very heavy heart aware of the pain she was going to communicate and perceiving by $marianne_dashwood$ #letter# how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it then sat down to write her #mother# an account of what had passed and entreat her directions for the future while $marianne_dashwood$ who came into the drawing room on $mrs_jennings$ going away remained fixed at the table where $elinor$ wrote watching the advancement of her pen grieving over her for the hardship of such a task and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her #mother#
in this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour when $marianne_dashwood$ whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise was startled by a rap at the door
$mrs_willoughby$ filled every page who can this be cried $elinor$ so early too i thought we had been safe
$marianne_dashwood$ moved to the window it is colonel $mrs_brandon$ said she with vexation we are never safe from him
he #will# not come in as $mrs_jennings$ is from home i #will# not trust to that retreating to her own room
a #man# who has #nothing# to do with his own #time# has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others
the event proved her conjecture right though it was founded on injustice and error for colonel $mrs_brandon$ did come in and $elinor$ who was convinced that solicitude for $marianne_dashwood$ brought him thither and who saw that solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her could not forgive her #sister# for esteeming him so lightly
i met $mrs_jennings$ in bond street said he after the first salutation and she encouraged me to come on and i was the more easily encouraged because i thought it probable that i might find you alone which i was very desirous of doing
i hope i believe it is is to be a means of giving comfort no i must not say comfort not present comfort but conviction lasting conviction to your #sister# mind
my regard for her for yourself for your #mother# #will# you allow me to prove it by relating some circumstances which #nothing# but a very sincere regard #nothing# but an earnest desire of being useful
i think i am justified though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that i am right is there not some reason to fear i may be wrong
my object my #wish# my sole #wish# in desiring it he stopped i understand you said $elinor$
you have something to tell me of mr $mrs_willoughby$ that #will# open his character farther your telling it #will# be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn $marianne_dashwood$
my gratitude #will# be insured immediately by any information tending to that end and hers must be gained by it in #time#
you shall and to be brief when i quitted $barton$ last october but this #will# give you no idea i must go farther back
pray pray let me hear it you #will# find me a very awkward narrator miss $marianne_dashwood$ i hardly know where to begin
a short account of myself i believe #will# be necessary and it shall be a short one on such a #subject# sighing heavily can i have little temptation to be diffuse
you have probably entirely forgotten a conversation it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you a conversation between us one evening at $barton$ park it was the evening of a dance in which i alluded to a #lady# i had once known as resembling in some measure your #sister# $marianne_dashwood$
he stopt a moment for recollection and then with another sigh went on indeed answered $elinor$ i have not forgotten it
he looked pleased by this remembrance and added if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender recollection there is a very strong resemblance between them as well in mind as person
the same warmth of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits this #lady# was one of my nearest relations an orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my #father#
i cannot remember the #time# when i did not love eliza and my affection for her as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me incapable of having ever felt
hers for me was i believe fervent as the #attachment# of your #sister# to mr $mrs_willoughby$ and it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate
our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends at seventeen she was lost to me for ever
and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her #uncle# and guardian
she was married married against her inclination to my brother her #fortune# was large and our family estate much encumbered my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her
i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty and for some #time# it did but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though she had promised me that #nothing# but
how blindly i relate i have never told you how this was brought on we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland
i was banished to the #house# of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my #father# point was gained
i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few #month# must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have now to lament it
my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been and from the first he treated her unkindly
the treachery or the folly of my cousin maid betrayed us this however was not the case the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as $mrs_brandon$ was but too natural
she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned
but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my #father# lived only a few #month# after their marriage and i was with my regiment in the east indies she should fall
had i remained in england perhaps but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange
the shock which her marriage had given me he continued in a voice of great agitation was of trifling weight was #nothing# to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce
it was that which threw this gloom even now the recollection of what i suffered he could say no more and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room
$elinor$ affected by his relation and still more by his distress could not speak he saw her concern and coming to her took her hand pressed it and kissed it with grateful respect
a few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned to england
my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek for her but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy
i could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin
her legal allowance was not adequate to her #fortune# nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some #month# before to another person
he imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief
regard for a former servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit him in a spunging #house# where he was confined for debt and there in the same #house# under a similar confinement was my unfortunate #sister#
at last however and after i had been six #month# in england i did find her so altered so faded worn down by acute suffering of every kind
hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me to be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom i had once doted
what i endured in so beholding her but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it i have pained you too much already
that she was to all appearance in the last stage of a consumption was yes in such a situation it was my greatest comfort
i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings and under proper attendants i visited her every #day# during the rest of her short life
life could do #nothing# for her beyond giving #time# for a better preparation for death and that was given i was with her in her last moments
again he stopped to recover himself and $elinor$ spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern at the fate of his unfortunate friend
your #sister# i hope cannot be offended said he by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation
their fates their #fortune# cannot be the same and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you #will# live to see the other be
but to what does all this lead i seem to have been distressing you for #nothing# ah miss $marianne_dashwood$ a #subject# such as this untouched for fourteen years
she left to my care her only child a little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then about three years old
it is dangerous to handle it at all i #will# be more collected more concise she loved the child and had always kept it with her
it was a valued a precious trust to me and gladly would i have discharged it in the strictest #sense# by watching over her education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it but i had no family no home and my little eliza was therefore placed at school
i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my brother which happened about five years ago and which left to me the possession of the family property she visited me at delaford
i called her a distant relation but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her
it is now three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year that i removed her from school to place her under the care of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same #time# of life and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation
i had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned out at her earnest desire to go to bath with one of her young friends who was attending her #father# there for his health
i knew him to be a very good sort of #man# and i thought well of his daughter better than she deserved for with a most obstinate and ill judged secrecy she would tell #nothing# would give no clue though she certainly knew all
he her #father# a well meaning but not a quick sighted #man# could really i believe give no information for he had been generally confined to the #house# while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose and he tried to convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself of his daughter being entirely unconcerned in the business
in short i could learn #nothing# but that she was gone all the rest for eight long #month# was left to conjecture
but last february almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared what i thought what i feared may be imagined and what i suffered too
good heavens cried $elinor$ could it be could $mrs_willoughby$ the first news that reached me of her he continued came in a #letter# from herself last october
it was forwarded to me from delaford and i received it on the very morning of our intended party to whitwell and this was the reason of my leaving $barton$ so suddenly which i am sure must at the #time# have appeared strange to every body and which i believe gave offence to some
little did mr $mrs_willoughby$ imagine i suppose when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party that i was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable but had he known it what would it have availed
would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your #sister# no he had already done that which no #man# who can feel for another would do
he had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced in a situation of the utmost distress with no creditable home
no help no friends ignorant of his address he had left her promising to return he neither returned nor wrote nor relieved her
this is beyond every #thing# exclaimed $elinor$ his character is now before you expensive dissipated and worse than both
knowing all this as i have now known it many weeks guess what i must have felt on seeing your #sister# as fond of him as ever and on being assured that she was to marry him guess what i must have felt for all your #sake#
when i came to you last week and found you alone i came determined to know the truth though irresolute what to do when it was known
my behaviour must have seemed strange to you then but now you #will# comprehend it to suffer you all to be so deceived to see your #sister# but what could i do
i had no hope of interfering with success and sometimes i thought your #sister# influence might yet reclaim him but now after such dishonorable usage who can tell what were his designs on her
whatever they may have been however she may now and hereafter doubtless #will# turn with gratitude towards her own condition when she compares it with that of my poor eliza when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl and pictures her to herself with an affection for him so strong still as strong as her own and with a mind tormented by self reproach which must attend her through life
surely this comparison must have its use with her she #will# feel her own sufferings to be #nothing# they proceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrace
on the contrary every friend must be made still more her friend by them concern for her unhappiness and respect for her fortitude under it must strengthen every #attachment#
you must know best what #will# be its effect but had i not seriously and from my heart believed it might be of service might lessen her regrets i would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others
$elinor$ thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to $marianne_dashwood$ from the communication of what had passed
i have been more pained said she by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do
use your own discretion however in communicating to her what i have told you now though at first she #will# suffer much i am sure she #will# soon become easier
have you she continued after a short silence ever seen mr $mrs_willoughby$ since you left him at $barton$ yes he replied gravely once i have
one meeting was unavoidable $elinor$ startled by his manner looked at him anxiously saying what have you met him to
eliza had confessed to me though most reluctantly the name of her lover and when he returned to town which was within a fortnight after myself we met by appointment he to defend i to punish his conduct
$elinor$ sighed over the fancied necessity of this but to a #man# and a soldier she presumed not to censure it
i could meet him no other way we returned unwounded and the meeting therefore never got abroad such said colonel $mrs_brandon$ after a pause has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of #mother# and daughter
no as soon as she recovered from her lying in for i found her near her delivery i removed her and her child into the country and there she remains
recollecting soon afterwards that he was probably dividing $elinor$ from her #sister# he put an end to his visit receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him
when the particulars of this conversation were repeated by miss $marianne_dashwood$ to her #sister# as they very soon were the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see
not that $marianne_dashwood$ appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention made neither objection nor remark attempted no vindication of $mrs_willoughby$ and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible
but though this behaviour assured $elinor$ that the conviction of this guilt was carried home to her mind though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it in her no longer avoiding colonel $mrs_brandon$ when he called in her speaking to him even voluntarily speaking with a kind of compassionate respect and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before she did not see her less wretched
and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust is she still in town chapter her mind did become settled but it was settled in a gloomy dejection
she felt the loss of $mrs_willoughby$ character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart his seduction and desertion of miss williams the misery of that poor girl and the doubt of what his designs might once have been on herself preyed altogether so much on her spirits that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to $elinor$ and brooding over her #sorrow# in silence gave more pain to her #sister# than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them
to give the feelings or the language of mrs $marianne_dashwood$ on receiving and answering $elinor$ #letter# would be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said of a disappointment hardly less painful than $marianne_dashwood$ and an indignation even greater than $elinor$
long #letter# from her quickly succeeding each other arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought to express her anxious solicitude for $marianne_dashwood$ and entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune
bad indeed must the nature of $marianne_dashwood$ affliction be when her #mother# could talk of fortitude mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets which she could #wish# her not to indulge
against the interest of her own individual comfort mrs $marianne_dashwood$ had determined that it would be better for $marianne_dashwood$ to be any where at that #time# than at $barton$ where every #thing# within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner by constantly placing $mrs_willoughby$ before her such as she had always seen him there
she recommended it to her daughters therefore by all means not to shorten their visit to $mrs_jennings$ the length of which though never exactly fixed had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks
a variety of occupations of objects and of company which could not be procured at $barton$ would be inevitable there and might yet she hoped
cheat $marianne_dashwood$ at #time# into some interest beyond herself and even into some amusement much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her
from all danger of seeing $mrs_willoughby$ again her #mother# considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends
design could never bring them in each other way negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of london than even in the retirement of $barton$ where it might force him before her while paying that visit at allenham on his marriage which mrs $marianne_dashwood$ from foreseeing at first as a probable event had brought herself to expect as a certain one
she had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were a #letter# from her son in law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of february and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother
$marianne_dashwood$ had promised to be guided by her #mother# opinion and she submitted to it therefore without opposition though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected though she felt it to be entirely wrong formed on mistaken grounds and that by requiring her longer continuance in london it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness the personal sympathy of her #mother# and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment rest
but it was a matter of great consolation to her that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her #sister# and $elinor$ on the other hand suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid $mr_edward_ferrars$ entirely comforted herself by thinking that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness it would be better for $marianne_dashwood$ than an immediate return into devonshire
$marianne_dashwood$ though without knowing it herself reaped all its advantage for neither $mrs_jennings$ nor sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ nor even $mrs_palmer$ herself ever spoke of him before her
$elinor$ wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself but that was impossible and she was obliged to listen #day# after #day# to the indignation of them all
her carefulness in guarding her #sister# from ever hearing $mrs_willoughby$ name mentioned was not thrown away sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ could not have thought it possible
a #man# of whom he had always had such reason to think well such a good natured fellow he did not believe there was a bolder rider in england
it was an unaccountable business he wished him at the devil with all his heart he would not speak another word to him meet him where he might for all the world
no not if it were to be by the side of $barton$ covert and they were kept watching for two hours together
such a scoundrel of a fellow such a deceitful dog it was only the last #time# they met that he had offered him one of folly puppies
she was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all
and this was the end of it $mrs_palmer$ in her way was equally angry she wished with all her heart
$combe_magna$ was not so near cleveland but it did not signify for it was a great deal too far off to visit she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again and she should tell everybody she saw how good for #nothing# he was
the rest of $mrs_palmer$ sympathy was shewn in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage and communicating them to $elinor$
she could soon tell at what coachmaker the new carriage was building by what painter mr $mrs_willoughby$ portrait was drawn and at what warehouse miss grey clothes might be seen
the calm and polite unconcern of $lady_middleton$ on the occasion was a happy relief to $elinor$ spirits oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness of the others
it was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in one person at least among their circle of friends a great comfort to know that there was one who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars or any anxiety for her #sister# health
every qualification is raised at #time# by the circumstances of the moment to more than its real value and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good nature
$lady_middleton$ expressed her #sense# of the affair about once every #day# or twice if the #subject# occurred very often by saying it is very shocking indeed and by the means of this continual though gentle vent was able not only to see the miss dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies and therefore determined though rather against the opinion of sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ that as $mrs_willoughby$ would at once be a woman of elegance and #fortune# to leave her card with her as soon as she married
he had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her #sister# disappointment by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it and they always conversed with confidence
his chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past #sorrow# and present humiliations was given in the pitying eye with which $marianne_dashwood$ sometimes observed him and the gentleness of her voice whenever though it did not often happen
colonel $mrs_brandon$ delicate unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to miss $marianne_dashwood$ she was obliged or could oblige herself to speak to him
these assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good #will# towards himself and these gave $elinor$ hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter but $mrs_jennings$ who knew #nothing# of all this who knew only that the colonel continued as grave as ever and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself nor commission her to make it for him began at the end of two #day# to think that instead of midsummer they would not be married till michaelmas and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all
the good understanding between the colonel and miss $marianne_dashwood$ seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry tree the canal and the yew arbour would all be made over to her and $mrs_jennings$ had for some #time# ceased to think at all of mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$
early in february within a fortnight from the receipt of $mrs_willoughby$ #letter# $elinor$ had the painful office of informing her #sister# that he was married
she had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over as she was desirous that $marianne_dashwood$ should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers which she saw her eagerly examining every morning
she received the news with resolute composure made no observation on it and at first shed no tears but after a short #time# they would burst out and for the rest of the #day# she was in a state hardly less pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event
the willoughbys left town as soon as they were married and $elinor$ now hoped as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them to prevail on her #sister# who had never yet left the #house# since the blow first fell to go out again by degrees as she had done before
about this #time# the two $miss_steeles$ lately arrived at their cousin #house# in bartlett buildings holburn presented themselves again before their more grand relations in conduit and berkeley streets and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality
their presence always gave her pain and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of $miss_lucy_steele$ in finding her still in town
i should have been quite disappointed if i had not found you here still said she repeatedly with a strong emphasis on the word
i was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile though you told me you know at $barton$ that you should not stay above a #month#
$elinor$ only was sorry to see them but i always thought i should but i thought at the #time# that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point
it would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and #sister# came and now to be sure you #will# be in no hurry to be gone
i am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word $elinor$ perfectly understood her and was forced to use all her self command to make it appear that she did not
not in the stage i assure you replied $miss_lucy_steele$ with quick exultation we came post all the way and had a very smart beau to attend us
dr davies was coming to town and so we thought we join him in a post chaise and he behaved very genteelly and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did
well my dear said $mrs_jennings$ and how did you travel oh oh cried $mrs_jennings$ very pretty indeed
and the doctor is a single #man# i warrant you there now said $miss_lucy_steele$ affectedly simpering everybody laughs at me so about the doctor and i cannot think why
my cousins say they are sure i have made a conquest but for my part i declare i never think about him from one hour end to another
lord here comes your beau nancy my cousin saidt other #day# when she saw him crossing the street to the #house#
my beau indeed said i i cannot think who you mean the doctor is no beau of mine aye aye that is very pretty talking but it wont do the doctor is the #man# i see
no indeed replied her cousin with affected earnestness and i beg you #will# contradict it if you ever hear it talked of
$mrs_jennings$ directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she certainly would not and $miss_lucy_steele$ was made completely happy
i suppose you #will# go and stay with your brother and #sister# miss $marianne_dashwood$ when they come to town said $miss_lucy_steele$ returning after a cessation of hostile hints to the charge
no i do not think we shall oh yes i dare say you #will# $elinor$ would not humour her by farther opposition
what a charming #thing# it is that mrs $marianne_dashwood$ can spare you both for so long a #time# together long a #time# indeed interposed $mrs_jennings$
why their visit is but just begun $miss_lucy_steele$ was silenced i am sorry we cannot see your #sister# miss $marianne_dashwood$ said $miss_lucy_steele$
i am sorry she is not well for $marianne_dashwood$ had left the room on their arrival you are very good
my #sister# #will# be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head aches which make her unfit for company or conversation
but such old friends as $miss_lucy_steele$ and me i think she might see us and i am sure we would not speak a word
her #sister# was perhaps laid down upon the bed or in her dressing gown and therefore not able to come to them
oh dear that is a great pity $elinor$ with great civility declined the proposal oh if that all cried $miss_lucy_steele$ we can just as well go and see her
$elinor$ began to find this impertinence too much for her temper but she was saved the trouble of checking it by $miss_lucy_steele$ sharp reprimand which now as on many occasions though it did not give much sweetness to the manners of one #sister# was of advantage in governing those of the other
after some opposition $marianne_dashwood$ yielded to her #sister# entreaties and consented to go out with her and $mrs_jennings$ one morning for #half# an hour
she expressly conditioned however for paying no visits and would do no more than accompany them to gray in sackville street where $elinor$ was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old fashioned jewels of her #mother#
when they stopped at the door $mrs_jennings$ recollected that there was a #lady# at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call and as she had no business at gray it was resolved that while her young friends transacted their she should pay her visit and return for them
on ascending the stairs the miss dashwoods found so many people before them in the room that there was not a person at liberty to tend to their orders and they were obliged to wait
all that could be done was to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession one gentleman only was standing there and it is probable that $elinor$ was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch
chapter but the correctness of his eye and the delicacy of his taste proved to be beyond his politeness
he was giving orders for a toothpick case for himself and till its size shape and ornaments were determined all of which after examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick case in the shop were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two #lady# than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares a kind of notice which served to imprint on $elinor$ the remembrance of a person and face of strong natural sterling insignificance though adorned in the first style of fashion
$marianne_dashwood$ was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment on this impertinent examination of their features and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick cases presented to his inspection by remaining unconscious of it all for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself and be as ignorant of what was passing around her in mr gray shop as in her own bedroom
the ivory the gold and the pearls all received their appointment and the gentleman having named the last #day# on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick case drew on his gloves with leisurely care and bestowing another glance on the miss dashwoods but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference
$elinor$ lost no #time# in bringing her business forward was on the point of concluding it when another gentleman presented himself at her side
at last the affair was decided she turned her eyes towards his face and found him with some surprise to be her brother
$mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ was really far from being sorry to see his #sister# again it rather gave them satisfaction and his inquiries after their #mother# were respectful and attentive
their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in mr gray shop $elinor$ found that he and $fanny$ had been in town two #day#
i wished very much to call upon you yesterday said he but it was impossible for we were obliged to take harry to see the wild beasts at exeter exchange and we spent the rest of the #day# with mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$
this morning i had fully intended to call on you if i could possibly find a spare #half# hour but one has always so much to do on first coming to town
but tomorrow i think i shall certainly be able to call in berkeley street and be introduced to your friend $mrs_jennings$
harry was vastly pleased i am come here to bespeak $fanny$ a seal i understand she is a woman of very good #fortune#
and the $middletons$ too you must introduce me to them as my #mother# in law relations i shall be happy to show them every respect
they are excellent neighbours to you in the country i understand excellent indeed their attention to our comfort their friendliness in every particular is more than i can express
but so it ought to be they are people of large #fortune# they are related to you and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected
i am extremely glad to hear it upon my word extremely glad indeed and so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for #nothing#
$mr_edward_ferrars$ brought us a most charming account of the place the most complete #thing# of its kind he said that ever was and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any #thing#
$elinor$ did feel a little ashamed of her brother and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him by the arrival of $mrs_jennings$ servant who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door
mr $marianne_dashwood$ attended them down stairs was introduced to $mrs_jennings$ at the door of her carriage and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next #day# took leave
he came with a pretence at an apology from their #sister# in law for not coming too but she was so much engaged with her #mother# that really she had no leisure for going any where
$mrs_jennings$ however assured him directly that she should not stand upon ceremony for they were all cousins or something like it and she should certainly wait on mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ very soon and bring her #sister# to see her
his manners to them though calm were perfectly kind to $mrs_jennings$ most attentively civil and on colonel $mrs_brandon$ coming in soon after himself he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say that he only wanted to know him to be rich to be equally civil to him
after staying with them #half# an hour he asked $elinor$ to walk with him to conduit street and introduce him to sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ and $lady_middleton$
it was a great satisfaction to us to hear it i assure you his visit was duly paid the weather was remarkably fine and she readily consented
as soon as they were out of the #house# his enquiries began who is colonel $mrs_brandon$ is he a #man# of #fortune#
he seems a most gentlemanlike #man# and i think $elinor$ i may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life
yes he has very good property in dorsetshire i am glad of it me brother what do you mean
he likes you i observed him narrowly and am convinced of it what is the amount of his #fortune# i believe about two thousand a year
two thousand a year and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity he added $elinor$ i #wish# with all my heart it were twice as much for your #sake#
indeed i believe you replied $elinor$ but i am very sure that colonel $mrs_brandon$ has not the smallest #wish# of marrying me
perhaps just at present he may be undecided the smallness of your #fortune# may make him hang back his friends may all advise him against it
but some of those little attentions and encouragements which #lady# can so easily give #will# fix him in spite of himself
you are mistaken $elinor$ you are very much mistaken a very little trouble on your side secures him and there can be no reason why you should not try for him
it is not to be supposed that any prior #attachment# on your side in short you know as to an #attachment# of that kind it is quite out of the question the objections are insurmountable you have too much #sense# not to see all that
colonel $mrs_brandon$ must be the #man# and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family
in short it is a kind of #thing# that lowering his voice to an important whisper #will# be exceedingly welcome to all parties
recollecting himself however he added that is i mean to say your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled
it is a match that must give universal satisfaction $fanny$ particularly for she has your interest very much at heart i assure you
and her #mother# too mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ a very good natured woman i am sure it would give her great pleasure she said as much the other #day#
$elinor$ would not vouchsafe any answer it would be something remarkable now he continued something droll if $fanny$ should have a brother
and i a #sister# settling at the same #time# and yet it is not very unlikely is $mr_edward_ferrars$ said $elinor$ with resolution going to be married
mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ with the utmost liberality #will# come forward and settle on him a thousand a year if the match takes place
it is not actually settled but there is such a #thing# in agitation he has a most excellent #mother# the #lady# is the hon
$miss_morton$ only daughter of the late lord morton with thirty thousand pounds a very desirable connection on both sides and i have not a doubt of its taking place in #time#
a thousand a year is a great deal for a #mother# to give away to make over for ever but mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ has a noble spirit
to give you another instance of her liberality the other #day# as soon as we came to town aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now she put bank notes into $fanny$ hands to the amount of two hundred pounds
he paused for her assent and compassion and she forced herself to say your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable but your income is a large one
and extremely acceptable it is for we must live at a great expense while we are here not so large i dare say as many people suppose
i do not mean to complain however it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope #will# in #time# be better
and then i have made a little purchase within this #half# year east kingham farm you must remember the place where old gibson used to live
the land was so very desirable for me in every respect so immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it my #duty# to buy it
the enclosure of norland common now carrying on is a most serious drain i could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands
a #man# must pay for his convenience and it has cost me a vast deal of money more than you think it really and intrinsically worth
i might have sold it again the next #day# for more than i gave but with regard to the purchase money i might have been very unfortunate indeed for the stocks were at that #time# so low that if i had not happened to have the necessary #sum# in my banker hands i must have sold out to very great loss
why i hope not that $elinor$ could only smile other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to norland
our respected #father# as you well know bequeathed all the stanhill effects that remained at norland and very valuable they were to your #mother#
far be it from me to repine at his doing so he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose but in consequence of it we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen china to supply the place of what was taken away
you may guess after all these expenses how very far we must be from being rich and how acceptable mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ kindness is
certainly said $elinor$ and assisted by her liberality i hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances
another year or two may do much towards it he gravely replied but however there is still a great deal to be done
there is not a stone laid of $fanny$ green #house# and #nothing# but the plan of the flower garden marked out where is the green #house# to be
it #will# be a very fine object from many parts of the park and the flower garden #will# slope down just before it and be exceedingly pretty
upon the knoll behind the #house# the old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it we have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow
$elinor$ kept her concern and her censure to herself and was very thankful that $marianne_dashwood$ was not present to share the provocation
having now said enough to make his poverty clear and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear rings for each of his #sister# in his next visit at gray his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn and he began to congratulate $elinor$ on having such a friend as $mrs_jennings$
she seems a most valuable woman indeed her #house# her style of living all bespeak an exceeding good income and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto but in the end may prove materially advantageous her inviting you to town is certainly a vast #thing# in your favour and indeed it speaks altogether so great a regard for you that in all probability when she dies you #will# not be forgotten
she must have a great deal to leave #nothing# at all i should rather suppose for she has only her jointure which #will# descend to her children
but it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income few people of common prudence #will# do that and whatever she saves she #will# be able to dispose of
and do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters than to us
whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not disregard
#nothing# can be kinder than her behaviour and she can hardly do all this without being aware of the expectation it raises
her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther but she raises none in those most concerned
indeed brother your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far why to be sure said he seeming to recollect himself people have little have very little in their power
but my dear $elinor$ what is the matter with $marianne_dashwood$ she looks very unwell has lost her colour and is grown quite thin
is she ill she is not well she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks i am sorry for that
at her #time# of life any #thing# of an illness destroys the bloom for ever hers has been a very short one
she was as handsome a girl last september as i ever saw and as likely to attract the #man# there was something in her style of beauty to please them particularly
i remember $fanny$ used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did not but what she is exceedingly fond of you but so it happened to strike her
i question whether $marianne_dashwood$ now #will# marry a #man# worth more than five or six hundred a year at the utmost and i am very much deceived if you do not do better
but my dear $elinor$ i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it and i think i can answer for your having $fanny$ and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your #visitor#
$elinor$ tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying colonel $mrs_brandon$ but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman and promoting the marriage by every possible attention
he had just compunction enough for having done #nothing# for his #sister# himself to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal and an offer from colonel $mrs_brandon$ or a legacy from $mrs_jennings$ was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect
she #will# be mistaken however dorsetshire i know very little of dorsetshire they were lucky enough to find $lady_middleton$ at home and sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ came in before their visit ended
sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ was ready to like anybody and though mr $marianne_dashwood$ did not seem to know much about horses he soon set him down as a very good natured fellow while $lady_middleton$ saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having and mr $marianne_dashwood$ went away delighted with both
abundance of civilities passed on all sides i shall have a charming account to carry to $fanny$ said he as he walked back with his #sister#
$lady_middleton$ is really a most elegant woman such a woman as i am sure $fanny$ #will# be glad to know
your #sister# need not have any scruple even of visiting her which to say the truth has been a little the case and very naturally for we only knew that $mrs_jennings$ was the widow of a #man# who had got all his money in a low way and $fanny$ and mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ were both strongly prepossessed that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as $fanny$ would like to associate with
and $mrs_jennings$ too an exceedingly well behaved woman though not so elegant as her daughter but now i can carry her a most satisfactory account of both
mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ had so much confidence in her husband judgment that she waited the very next #day# both on $mrs_jennings$ and her daughter and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former even the woman with whom her #sister# were staying by no means unworthy her notice and as for $lady_middleton$ she found her one of the most charming women in the world
there was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides which mutually attracted them and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor and a general want of understanding
the same manners however which recommended mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ to the good opinion of $lady_middleton$ did not suit the fancy of $mrs_jennings$ and to her she appeared #nothing# more than a little proud looking woman of uncordial address who met her husband #sister# without any affection and almost without having anything to say to them for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on berkeley street she sat at least seven minutes and a #half# in silence
$elinor$ wanted very much to know though she did not chuse to ask whether $mr_edward_ferrars$ was then in town but #nothing# would have induced $fanny$ voluntarily to mention his name before her till able to tell her that his marriage with $miss_morton$ was resolved on or till her husband expectations on colonel $mrs_brandon$ were answered because she believed them still so very much attached to each other that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion
chapter $lady_middleton$ was equally pleased with mrs $marianne_dashwood$ the intelligence however which she would not give soon flowed from another quarter
$miss_lucy_steele$ came very shortly to claim $elinor$ compassion on being unable to see $mr_edward_ferrars$ though he had arrived in town with mr and mrs $marianne_dashwood$
he dared not come to bartlett buildings for fear of detection and though their mutual impatience to meet was not to be told they could do #nothing# at present but write
$mr_edward_ferrars$ assured them himself of his being in town within a very short #time# by twice calling in berkeley street twice was his card found on the table when they returned from their morning engagements
the dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the $middletons$ that though not much in the habit of giving anything they determined to give them a dinner and soon after their acquaintance began invited them to dine in harley street where they had taken a very good #house# for three #month#
their #sister# and $mrs_jennings$ were invited likewise and $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ was careful to secure colonel $mrs_brandon$ who always glad to be where the miss dashwoods were received his eager civilities with some surprise but much more pleasure
$elinor$ was pleased that he had called and still more pleased that she had missed him they were to meet mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ but $elinor$ could not learn whether her sons were to be of the party
the expectation of seeing her however was enough to make her interested in the engagement for though she could now meet $mr_edward_ferrars$ #mother# without that strong anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself her desire of being in company with mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ her curiosity to know what she was like was as lively as ever
the interest with which she thus anticipated the party was soon afterwards increased more powerfully than pleasantly by her hearing that the $miss_steeles$ were also to be at it
so well had they recommended themselves to $lady_middleton$ so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her that though $miss_lucy_steele$ was certainly not so elegant and her #sister# not even genteel she was as ready as sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ to ask them to spend a week or two in conduit street and it happened to be particularly convenient to the $miss_steeles$ as soon as the dashwoods invitation was known that their visit should begin a few #day# before the party took place
their claims to the notice of mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother might not have done much however towards procuring them seats at her table but as $lady_middleton$ guests they must be welcome and $miss_lucy_steele$ who had long wanted to be personally known to the family to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them had seldom been happier in her life than she was on receiving mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ card
she began immediately to determine that $mr_edward_ferrars$ who lived with his #mother# must be asked as his #mother# was to a party given by his #sister# and to see him for the first #time# after all that passed in the company of $miss_lucy_steele$ she hardly knew how she could bear it
on $elinor$ its effect was very different these apprehensions perhaps were not founded entirely on reason and certainly not at all on truth
they were relieved however not by her own recollection but by the good #will# of $miss_lucy_steele$ who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that $mr_edward_ferrars$ certainly would not be in harley street on tuesday and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme affection for herself which he could not conceal when they were together
the important tuesday came that was to introduce the two young #lady# to this formidable #mother# in law pity me dear miss $marianne_dashwood$
said $miss_lucy_steele$ as they walked up the stairs together for the $middletons$ arrived so directly after $mrs_jennings$ that they all followed the servant at the same #time# there is nobody here
but you that can feel for me i declare i can hardly stand good gracious in a moment i shall see the person that all my happiness depends on that is to be
my #mother# $elinor$ could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being $miss_morton$ #mother# rather than her own whom they were about to behold but instead of doing that she assured her and with great sincerity that she did pity her to the utter amazement of $miss_lucy_steele$ who though really uncomfortable herself hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to $elinor$
mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ was a little thin woman upright even to formality in her figure and serious even to sourness in her aspect
her complexion was sallow and her features small without beauty and naturally without expression but a lucky contraction of the brow had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature
she was not a woman of many words for unlike people in general she proportioned them to the number of her ideas and of the few syllables that did escape her not one fell to the share of miss $marianne_dashwood$ whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events
a few #month# ago it would have hurt her exceedingly but it was not in mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ power to distress her by it
$elinor$ could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour now and the difference of her manners to the $miss_steeles$ a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more
she could not but smile to see the graciousness of both #mother# and daughter towards the very person for $miss_lucy_steele$ was particularly distinguished whom of all others had they known as much as she did they would have been most anxious to mortify while she herself who had comparatively no power to wound them sat pointedly slighted by both
but while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied she could not reflect on the mean spirited folly from which it sprung nor observe the studied attentions with which the $miss_steeles$ courted its continuance without thoroughly despising them all four
$miss_lucy_steele$ was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished and $miss_lucy_steele$ wanted only to be teazed about dr davies to be perfectly happy
the dinner was a grand one the servants were numerous and every #thing# bespoke the mistress inclination for show and the master ability to support it
in spite of the improvements and additions which were making to the norland estate and in spite of its owner having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss #nothing# gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it no poverty of any kind except of conversation appeared but there the deficiency was considerable
only amused her $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing and his wife had still less
but there was no peculiar disgrace in this for it was very much the case with the chief of their #visitor# who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable want of #sense# either natural or improved want of elegance want of spirits or want of temper
when the #lady# withdrew to the drawing room after dinner this poverty was particularly evident for the gentlemen had supplied the discourse with some variety the variety of politics inclosing land and breaking horses but then it was all over and one #subject# only engaged the #lady# till coffee came in which was the comparative heights of harry $marianne_dashwood$ and $lady_middleton$ second son william who were nearly of the same age
had both the children been there the affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once but as harry only was present it was all conjectural assertion on both sides and every body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion and to repeat it over and over again as often as they liked
the parties stood thus the two #mother# though each really convinced that her own son was the tallest politely decided in favour of the other
$miss_lucy_steele$ who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them and $miss_lucy_steele$ with yet greater address gave it as fast as she could in favour of each
$elinor$ having once delivered her opinion on william side by which she offended mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ and $fanny$ still more did not see the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion and $marianne_dashwood$ when called on for hers offended them all by declaring that she had no opinion to give as she had never thought about it
before her removing from norland $elinor$ had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her #sister# in law which being now just mounted and brought home ornamented her present drawing room and these screens catching the eye of $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ on his following the other gentlemen into the room were officiously handed by him to colonel $mrs_brandon$ for his admiration
these are done by my eldest #sister# said he and you as a #man# of taste #will# i dare say be pleased with them
i do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well
the two grandmothers with not less partiality but more sincerity were equally earnest in support of their own descendant
the colonel though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship warmly admired the screens as he would have done any #thing# painted by miss $marianne_dashwood$ and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited they were handed round for general inspection
mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ not aware of their being $elinor$ work particularly requested to look at them and after they had received gratifying testimony of #lady# $middletons$ approbation $fanny$ presented them to her #mother# considerately informing her at the same #time# that they were done by miss $marianne_dashwood$
perhaps $fanny$ thought for a moment that her #mother# had been quite rude enough for colouring a little she immediately said they are very pretty ma am ant they
but then again the dread of having been too civil too encouraging herself probably came over her for she presently added do you not think they are something in $miss_morton$ style of painting ma am she does paint most delightfully how beautifully her last landscape is done
hum said mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ very pretty and without regarding them at all returned them to her daughter beautifully indeed but she does every #thing# well
$marianne_dashwood$ could not bear this she was already greatly displeased with mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ and such ill timed praise of another at $elinor$ expense though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by it provoked her immediately to say with warmth
this is admiration of a very particular kind what is $miss_morton$ to us who knows or who cares for her it is $elinor$ of whom we think and speak
and so saying she took the screens out of her #sister# in law hands to admire them herself as they ought to be admired
mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ looked exceedingly angry and drawing herself up more stiffly than ever pronounced in retort this bitter philippic $miss_morton$ is lord morton daughter
$elinor$ was much more hurt by $marianne_dashwood$ warmth than she had been by what produced it but colonel $mrs_brandon$ eyes as they were fixed on $marianne_dashwood$ declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a #sister# slighted in the smallest point
$fanny$ looked very angry too and her husband was all in a fright at his #sister# audacity $marianne_dashwood$ feelings did not stop here
the cold insolence of mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ general behaviour to her #sister# seemed to her to foretell such difficulties and distresses to $elinor$ as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility she moved after a moment to her #sister# chair and putting one arm round her neck and one cheek close to hers said in a low but eager voice dear dear $elinor$ dont mind them
she could say no more her spirits were quite overcome and hiding her face on $elinor$ shoulder she burst into tears
dont let them make you unhappy every body attention was called and almost every body was concerned colonel $mrs_brandon$ rose up and went to them without knowing what he did mrs
jennings with a very intelligent ah poor dear immediately gave her her salts and sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress that he instantly changed his seat to one close by $miss_lucy_steele$ and gave her in a whisper a brief account of the whole shocking affair
in a few minutes however $marianne_dashwood$ was recovered enough to put an end to the bustle and sit down among the rest though her spirits retained the impression of what had passed the whole evening
poor $marianne_dashwood$ said her brother to colonel $mrs_brandon$ in a low voice as soon as he could secure his attention
one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who has been a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions
she has not such good health as her #sister# she is very nervous she has not $elinor$ constitution and you would not think it perhaps but $marianne_dashwood$ was remarkably handsome a few #month# ago quite as handsome as $elinor$
satisfied she had found in her every #thing# that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable she had seen enough of her pride her meanness and her determined prejudice against herself to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement and retarded the marriage of $mr_edward_ferrars$ and herself had he been otherwise free and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her own #sake# that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ creation preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice or any solicitude for her good opinion
or at least if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in $mr_edward_ferrars$ being fettered to $miss_lucy_steele$ she determined that had $miss_lucy_steele$ been more amiable she ought to have rejoiced
now you see it is all gone chapter $elinor$ curiosity to see mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ was she wondered that $miss_lucy_steele$ spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of mrs
$mr_edward_ferrars$ that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was not $elinor$ appear a compliment to herself or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her because her real situation was unknown
but that it was so had not only been declared by $miss_lucy_steele$ eyes at the #time# but was declared over again the next morning more openly for at her particular desire $lady_middleton$ set her down in berkeley street on the chance of seeing $elinor$ alone to tell her how happy she was
the chance proved a lucky one for a message from $mrs_palmer$ soon after she arrived carried $mrs_jennings$ away
my dear friend cried $miss_lucy_steele$ as soon as they were by themselves i come to talk to you of my happiness
so exceeding affable as she was you know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her but the very moment i was introduced there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say she had quite took a fancy to me
could anything be so flattering as mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ way of treating me yesterday now was not it so you saw it all and was not you quite struck with it
she was certainly very civil to you civil did you see #nothing# but only civility i saw a vast deal more
such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me no pride no hauteur and your #sister# just the same all sweetness and affability
$elinor$ wished to talk of something else but $miss_lucy_steele$ still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness and $elinor$ was obliged to go on
undoubtedly if they had known your engagement said she #nothing# could be more flattering than their treatment of you but as that was not the case
i guessed you would say so replied $miss_lucy_steele$ quickly but there was no reason in the world why mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ should seem to like me if she did not and her liking me is every #thing#
i am sure it #will# all end well and there #will# be no difficulties at all to what i used to think
you shant talk me out of my satisfaction mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ is a charming woman and so is your #sister# they are both delightful women indeed i wonder i should never hear you say how agreeable mrs $marianne_dashwood$ was
to this $elinor$ had no answer to make and did not attempt any are you ill miss $marianne_dashwood$ you seem low you dont speak sure
you ant well i never was in better health i am glad of it with all my heart but really you did not look it
i should be sorry to have you ill you that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world heaven knows what i should have done without your friendship $elinor$
but it seemed to satisfy $miss_lucy_steele$ for she directly replied indeed i am perfectly convinced of your regard for me and next to $mr_edward_ferrars$ love it is the greatest comfort
$mr_edward_ferrars$ but now there is one good #thing# we shall be able to meet and meet pretty often for $lady_middleton$ delighted with mrs $marianne_dashwood$ so we shall be a good deal in harley street i dare say and $mr_edward_ferrars$ spends #half# his #time# with his #sister# besides $lady_middleton$ and mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ #will# visit now and mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ and your #sister# were both so good to say more than once they should always be glad to see me
they are such charming women i am sure if ever you tell your #sister# what i think of her you cannot speak too high
tried to make a civil answer though doubting her own success i have poor but $elinor$ would not give her any encouragement to hope that she should tell her #sister#
$miss_lucy_steele$ continued i am sure i should have seen it in a moment if mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ had took a dislike to me
if she had only made me a formal courtesy for instance without saying a word and never after had took any notice of me and never looked at me in a pleasant way you know what i mean if i had been treated in that forbidding sort of way i should have gave it all up in despair
$elinor$ was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph by the door being thrown open the servant announcing $mr_edward_ferrars$ and $mr_edward_ferrars$ immediately walking in
i could not have stood it for where she does dislike i know it is most violent it was a very awkward moment and the countenance of each shewed that it was so
they all looked exceedingly foolish and $mr_edward_ferrars$ seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again as to advance farther into it
the very circumstance in its unpleasantest form which they would each have been most anxious to avoid had fallen on them they were not only all three together but were together without the relief of any other person
the #lady# recovered themselves first it was not $miss_lucy_steele$ business to put herself forward and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up
but $elinor$ had more to do and so anxious was she for his #sake# and her own to do it well that she forced herself after a moment recollection to welcome him with a look and manner that were almost easy and almost open and another struggle another effort still improved them
she would not allow the presence of $miss_lucy_steele$ nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him and that she had very much regretted being from home when he called before in berkeley street
she would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which as a friend and almost a relation were his due by the observant eyes of $miss_lucy_steele$ though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her
her manners gave some re assurance to $mr_edward_ferrars$ and he had courage enough to sit down but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the #lady# in a proportion which the case rendered reasonable though his sex might make it rare for his heart had not the indifference of $miss_lucy_steele$ nor could his conscience have quite the ease of $elinor$
$miss_lucy_steele$ with a demure and settled air seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others and would not say a word and almost every #thing# that was said proceeded from $elinor$ who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her #mother# health their coming to town which $mr_edward_ferrars$ ought to have inquired about but never did
her exertions did not stop here for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine under pretence of fetching $marianne_dashwood$ to leave the others by themselves and she really did it and
that in the handsomest manner for she loitered away several minutes on the landing place with the most high minded fortitude before she went to her #sister#
when that was once done however it was #time# for the raptures of $mr_edward_ferrars$ to cease for $marianne_dashwood$ joy hurried her into the drawing room immediately
she could therefore only look her tenderness and after slightly addressing him said no more her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings strong in itself and strongly spoken
she met him with a hand that would be taken and a voice that expressed the affection of a #sister#
$mr_edward_ferrars$ tried to return her kindness as it deserved but before such witnesses he dared not say #half# what he really felt
again they all sat down and for a moment or two all were silent while $marianne_dashwood$ was looking with the most speaking tenderness sometimes at $mr_edward_ferrars$ and sometimes at $elinor$ regretting only that their delight in each other should be checked by $miss_lucy_steele$ unwelcome presence
$mr_edward_ferrars$ was the first to speak and it was to notice $marianne_dashwood$ altered looks and express his fear of her not finding london agree with her
dear $mr_edward_ferrars$ she cried this is a moment of great happiness this would almost make amends for every #thing# oh dont think of me
she replied with spirited earnestness though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke dont think of my health
this remark was not calculated to make $mr_edward_ferrars$ or $elinor$ more easy nor to conciliate the good #will# of $miss_lucy_steele$ who looked up at $marianne_dashwood$ with no very benignant expression
$elinor$ is well you see that must be enough for us both do you like london said $mr_edward_ferrars$ willing to say any #thing# that might introduce another #subject#
not at all i expected much pleasure in it but i have found none the sight of you $mr_edward_ferrars$ is the only comfort it has afforded and thank heaven
you are what you always were she paused no one spoke i think $elinor$ she presently added we must employ $mr_edward_ferrars$ to take care of us in our return to $barton$
in a week or two i suppose we shall be going and i trust $mr_edward_ferrars$ #will# not be very unwilling to accept the charge
but $marianne_dashwood$ who saw his agitation and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself was perfectly satisfied and soon talked of something else
poor $mr_edward_ferrars$ muttered something but what it was nobody knew not even himself we spent such a #day# $mr_edward_ferrars$ in harley street yesterday
so dull so wretchedly dull but i have much to say to you on that head which cannot be said now
and with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever and of her being particularly disgusted with his #mother# till they were more in private
but why were you not there $mr_edward_ferrars$ why did you not come i was engaged elsewhere engaged but what was that when such friends were to be met
perhaps miss $marianne_dashwood$ cried $miss_lucy_steele$ eager to take some revenge on her you think young #man# never stand upon engagements if they have no mind to keep them little as well as great
$elinor$ was very angry but $marianne_dashwood$ seemed entirely insensible of the sting for she calmly replied not so indeed for seriously speaking i am very sure that conscience only kept $mr_edward_ferrars$ from harley street
and i really believe he has the most delicate conscience in the world the most scrupulous in performing every engagement however minute and however it may make against his interest or pleasure
he is the most fearful of giving pain of wounding expectation and the most incapable of being selfish of any body i ever saw
what are you never to hear yourself praised then you must be no friend of mine for those who #will# accept of my love and esteem must submit to my open commendation
the nature of her commendation in the present case however happened to be particularly ill suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors and was so very unexhilarating to $mr_edward_ferrars$ that he very soon got up to go away
$mr_edward_ferrars$ it is so and i #will# say it going so soon said $marianne_dashwood$ my dear $mr_edward_ferrars$ this must not be
but even this encouragement failed for he would go and $miss_lucy_steele$ who would have outstaid him had his visit lasted two hours soon afterwards went away
and drawing him a little aside she whispered her persuasion that $miss_lucy_steele$ could not stay much longer what can bring her here so often said $marianne_dashwood$ on her leaving them
could not she see that we wanted her gone how teazing to $mr_edward_ferrars$ why so we were all his friends and $miss_lucy_steele$ has been the longest known to him of any
$marianne_dashwood$ looked at her steadily and said you know $elinor$ that this is a kind of talking which i cannot bear
if you only hope to have your assertion contradicted as i must suppose to be the case you ought to recollect that i am the last person in the world to do it
it is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves i cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances that are not really wanted
she then left the room and $elinor$ dared not follow her to say more for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to $miss_lucy_steele$ she could give no information that would convince $marianne_dashwood$ and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be she was obliged to submit to it
all that she could hope was that $mr_edward_ferrars$ would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing $marianne_dashwood$ mistaken warmth nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting and this
within a few #day# after this meeting the newspapers announced to the world that the #lady# of thomas $mrs_palmer$ esq was safely delivered of a son and heir a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph at least to all those intimate connections who knew it before
this event highly important to $mrs_jennings$ happiness produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her #time# and influenced in a like degree the engagements of her young friends for as she wished to be as much as possible with charlotte she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed and did not return till late in the evening and the miss dashwoods at the particular request of the $middletons$ spent the whole of every #day# in conduit street
for their own comfort they would much rather have remained at least all the morning in $mrs_jennings$ #house# but it was not a #thing# to be urged against the #wish# of everybody
their hours were therefore made over to $lady_middleton$ and the two $miss_steeles$ by whom their company in fact was as little valued as it was professedly sought
they had too much #sense# to be desirable companions to the former and by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye as intruding on their ground and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize
though #nothing# could be more polite than $lady_middleton$ behaviour to $elinor$ and $marianne_dashwood$ she did not really like them at all
because they neither flattered herself nor her children she could not believe them good natured and because they were fond of reading she fancied them satirical perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical but that did not signify
she had every reason to expect chapter it was censure in common use and easily given their presence was a restraint both on her and on $miss_lucy_steele$
$lady_middleton$ was ashamed of doing #nothing# before them and the flattery which $miss_lucy_steele$ was proud to think of and administer at other #time# she feared they would despise her for offering
$miss_lucy_steele$ was the least discomposed of the three by their presence and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely
would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between $marianne_dashwood$ and mr $mrs_willoughby$ she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner which their arrival occasioned
but this conciliation was not granted for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her #sister# to $elinor$ and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before $marianne_dashwood$ no effect was produced but a look of indifference from the former or of disgust in the latter
it checked the idleness of one and the business of the other an effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend
but so little were they anymore than the others inclined to oblige her that if sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ dined from home she might spend a whole #day# without hearing any other raillery on the #subject# than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself
all these jealousies and discontents however were so totally unsuspected by $mrs_jennings$ that she thought it a delightful #thing# for the girls to be together and generally congratulated her young friends every night on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long
she joined them sometimes at sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ sometimes at her own #house# but wherever it was she always came in excellent spirits full of delight and importance attributing charlotte well doing to her own care and ready to give so exact so minute a detail of her situation as only $miss_lucy_steele$ had curiosity enough to desire
would they only have laughed at her about the doctor one #thing# did disturb her and of that she made her daily complaint
mr $mrs_palmer$ maintained the common but unfatherly opinion among his sex of all infants being alike and though she could plainly perceive at different #time# the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides there was no convincing his #father# of it no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like every other baby of the same age nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the world
it so happened that while her two #sister# with $mrs_jennings$ were first calling on her in harley street another of her acquaintance had dropt in a circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her
but while the imaginations of other people #will# carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct and to decide on it by slight appearances one happiness must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance
in the present instance this last arrived #lady# allowed her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability that on merely hearing the name of the miss dashwoods and understanding them to be mr $marianne_dashwood$ #sister# she immediately concluded them to be staying in harley street and this misconstruction produced within a #day# or two afterwards cards of invitation for them as well as for their brother and #sister# to a small musical party at her #house#
the consequence of which was that mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the miss dashwoods but what was still worse must be #subject# to all the unpleasantness of appearing to treat them with attention and who could tell that they might not expect to go out with her a second #time#
i come now to the relation of a misfortune which about this #time# befell mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ the power of disappointing them it was true must always be hers
but that was not enough for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong they feel injured by the expectation of any #thing# better from them
$marianne_dashwood$ had now been brought by degrees so much into the habit of going out every #day# that it was become a matter of indifference to her whether she went or not and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening engagement though without expecting the smallest amusement from any and very often without knowing till the last moment where it was to take her
to her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent as not to bestow #half# the consideration on it during the whole of her toilet which it received from $miss_lucy_steele$ in the first five minutes of their being together when it was finished
#nothing# escaped her minute observation and general curiosity she saw every #thing# and asked every #thing# was never easy till she knew the price of every part of $marianne_dashwood$ dress could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than $marianne_dashwood$ herself and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted how much her washing cost per week and how much she had every year to spend upon herself
the impertinence of these kind of scrutinies moreover was generally concluded with a compliment which though meant as its douceur was considered by $marianne_dashwood$ as the greatest impertinence of all for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown the colour of her shoes and the arrangement of her hair she was almost sure of being told that upon her word she looked vastly smart and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests
with such encouragement as this was she dismissed on the present occasion to her brother carriage which they were ready to enter five minutes after it stopped at the door a punctuality not very agreeable to their #sister# in law who had preceded them to the #house# of her acquaintance and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman
the party like other musical parties comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance and a great many more who had none at all and the performers themselves were as usual in their own estimation and that of their immediate friends the first private performers in england
as $elinor$ was neither musical nor affecting to be so she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte whenever it suited her and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp and violoncello would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room
in one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of young #man# the very he who had given them a lecture on toothpick cases at gray
she perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself and speaking familiarly to her brother and had just determined to find out his name from the latter when they both came towards her and mr $marianne_dashwood$ introduced him to her as mr $mr_robert_ferrars$ $mr_edward_ferrars$
he addressed her with easy civility and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by $miss_lucy_steele$
happy had it been for her if her regard for $mr_edward_ferrars$ had depended less on his own merit than on the merit of his nearest relations
for then his brother bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the ill humour of his #mother# and #sister# would have begun
but while she wondered at the difference of the two young #man# she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other
why they were different $mr_robert_ferrars$ exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour conversation for talking of his brother and lamenting the extreme gaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency than to the misfortune of a private education while he himself though probably without any particular any material superiority by nature merely from the advantage of a public school was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other #man#
upon my soul he added i believe it is #nothing# more and so i often tell my #mother# when she is grieving about it
the events of this evening were not very remarkable my dear madam i always say to her you must make yourself easy
why would you be persuaded by my #uncle# sir $mr_robert_ferrars$ against your own judgment to place $mr_edward_ferrars$ under private tuition at the most critical #time# of his life
if you had only sent him to westminster as well as myself instead of sending him to mr pratt all this would have been prevented
the evil is now irremediable and it has been entirely your own doing this is the way in which i always consider the matter and my #mother# is perfectly convinced of her error
$elinor$ would not oppose his opinion because whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage of a public school she could not think of $mr_edward_ferrars$ abode in mr pratt family with any satisfaction
$elinor$ set him right as to its situation and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody could live in devonshire without living near dawlish
you reside in devonshire i think was his next observation in a cottage near dawlish he bestowed his hearty approbation however on their species of #house#
for my own part said he i am excessively fond of a cottage there is always so much comfort so much elegance about them
and i protest if i had any money to spare i should buy a little land and build one myself within a short distance of london where i might drive myself down at any #time# and collect a few friends about me and be happy
my friend lord courtland came to me the other #day# on purpose to ask my advice and laid before me three different plans of bonomi
i advise every body who is going to build to build a cottage i was to decide on the best of them
my dear courtland said i immediately throwing them all into the fire do not adopt either of them but by all means build a cottage
and that i fancy #will# be the end of it some people imagine that there can be no accommodations no space in a cottage but this is all a mistake
i was last #month# at my friend elliott near dartford #lady# elliott wished to give a dance but how can it be done said she my dear $mr_edward_ferrars$ do tell me how it is to be managed
i immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it so i said my dear #lady# elliott do not be uneasy
the dining parlour #will# admit eighteen couple with ease card tables may be placed in the drawing room the library may be open for tea and other refreshments and let the supper be set out in the saloon
there is not a room in this cottage that #will# hold ten couple and where can the supper be #lady# elliott was delighted with the thought
we measured the dining room and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan
so that in fact you see if people do but know how to set about it every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling
as $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ had no more pleasure in music than his eldest #sister# his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any #thing# else and a thought struck him during the evening which he communicated to his wife for her approbation when they got home
the consideration of mrs dennison mistake in supposing his #sister# their guests had suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such while $mrs_jennings$ engagements kept her from home
the expense would be #nothing# the inconvenience not more and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his #father#
$elinor$ agreed to it all for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition $fanny$ was startled at the proposal
i do not see how it can be done said she without affronting $lady_middleton$ for they spend every #day# with her otherwise i should be exceedingly glad to do it
you know i am always ready to pay them any attention in my power as my taking them out this evening shews
but they are $lady_middleton$ #visitor# how can i ask them away from her her husband but with great humility did not see the force of her objection
they had already spent a week in this manner in conduit street and $lady_middleton$ could not be displeased at their giving the same number of #day# to such near relations
$fanny$ paused a moment and then with fresh vigor said my love i would ask them with all my heart if it was in my power
but i had just settled within myself to ask the $miss_steeles$ to spend a few #day# with us
they are very well behaved good kind of girls and i think the attention is due to them as their #uncle# did so very well by $mr_edward_ferrars$
we can ask your #sister# some other year you know but the $miss_steeles$ may not be in town any more
i am sure you #will# like them indeed you do like them you know very much already and so does my #mother# and they are such favourites with harry
he saw the necessity of inviting the $miss_steeles$ immediately and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his #sister# another year at the same #time# however slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless by bringing $elinor$ to town as colonel $mrs_brandon$ wife and $marianne_dashwood$ as their #visitor#
$fanny$ rejoicing in her escape and proud of the ready wit that had procured it wrote the next morning to $miss_lucy_steele$ to request her company and her #sister# for some #day# in harley street as soon as $lady_middleton$ could spare them
mr $marianne_dashwood$ was convinced this was enough to make $miss_lucy_steele$ really and reasonably happy mrs $marianne_dashwood$ seemed actually working for her herself cherishing all her hopes and promoting all her views
such an opportunity of being with $mr_edward_ferrars$ and his family was above all #thing# the most material to her interest and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings
it was an advantage that could not be too gratefully acknowledged nor too speedily made use of and the visit to $lady_middleton$ which had not before had any precise limits was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two #day# #time#
when the note was shown to $elinor$ as it was within ten minutes after its arrival it gave her for the first #time# some share in the expectations of $miss_lucy_steele$ for such a mark of uncommon kindness vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance seemed to declare that the good #will# towards her arose from something more than merely malice against herself and might be brought by #time# and address to do every #thing# that $miss_lucy_steele$ wished
her flattery had already subdued the pride of $lady_middleton$ and made an entry into the close heart of mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ and these were effects that laid open the probability of greater
the $miss_steeles$ removed to harley street and all that reached $elinor$ of their influence there strengthened her expectation of the event
sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ who called on them more than once brought home such accounts of the favour they were in as must be universally striking
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life as she was with them had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant called $miss_lucy_steele$ by her christian name and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them
$mrs_palmer$ was so well at the end of a fortnight that her #mother# felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her #time# to her and contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a #day# returned from that period to her own home and her own habits in which she found the miss dashwoods very ready to resume their former share
about the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in berkeley street $mrs_jennings$ on returning from her ordinary visit to $mrs_palmer$ entered the drawing room where $elinor$ was sitting by herself with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful and giving her #time# only to form that idea began directly to justify it by saying lord
at this point in the first and second editions volume ii ended chapter my dear miss $marianne_dashwood$ have you heard the news
no ma am what is it something so strange but you shall hear it all when i got to mr $mrs_palmer$ i found charlotte quite in a fuss about the child
she was sure it was very ill it cried and fretted and was all over pimples so i looked at it directly and lord
but charlotte she would not be satisfied so mr donavan was sent for and luckily he happened to just come in from harley street so he stepped over directly and as soon as ever mama he said just as we did that it was #nothing# in the world but the red gum and then charlotte was easy
and so just as he was going away again it came into my head i am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news
so upon that he smirked and simpered and looked grave and seemed to know something or other and at last he said in a whisper for fear any unpleasant report should reach the young #lady# under your care as to their #sister# indisposition i think it advisable to say that i believe there is no great reason for alarm i hope mrs $marianne_dashwood$ #will# do very well
my dear says i it is #nothing# in the world but the red gum and nurse said just the same what is $fanny$ ill
so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this
that is exactly what i said my dear lord says i is mrs $marianne_dashwood$ ill $mr_edward_ferrars$ the very young #man# i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out
i am monstrous glad there was never any #thing# in it $mr_edward_ferrars$ it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin
$miss_lucy_steele$ there for you my dear and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except nancy could you have believed such a #thing# possible
there is no great wonder in their liking one another but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it that is strange i never happened to see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly
well and so this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ and neither she nor your brother or #sister# suspected a word of the matter till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a well meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out
lord thinks she to herself they are all so fond of $miss_lucy_steele$ to be sure they #will# make no difficulty about it and so away she went to your #sister# who was sitting all alone at her carpet work little suspecting what was to come for she had just been saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to make a match between $mr_edward_ferrars$ and some lord daughter or other
she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as reached your brother ears as he was sitting in his own dressing room down stairs thinking about writing a #letter# to his steward in the country
so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for $miss_lucy_steele$ was come to them by that #time# little dreaming what was going on
i forget who so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride poor soul
i think she was used very hardly for your #sister# scolded like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit
nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ declared they should not stay a minute longer in the #house# and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes
then she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan and mr donavan found the #house# in all this uproar
the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came off poor $miss_lucy_steele$ in such a condition he says she could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad
i declare i have no patience with your #sister# and i hope with all my heart it #will# be a match in spite of her
i pity her and i must say lord what a taking poor $mr_edward_ferrars$ #will# be in when he hears of it
to have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion and
he and i had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the #house# for your #sister# was sure she would be in hysterics too
mr donavan thinks just the same and so she may for what i care i have no pity for either of them
there is no reason on earth why $mr_edward_ferrars$ and $miss_lucy_steele$ should not marry for i am sure mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ may afford to do very well by her son and though $miss_lucy_steele$ has next to #nothing# herself she knows better than any body how to make the most of every #thing# i dare say if mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ would only allow him five hundred a year she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight
how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours or a little bigger with two maids and two #man# and i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my betty has a #sister# out of place that would fit them exactly
here $mrs_jennings$ ceased and as $elinor$ had had #time# enough to collect her thoughts she was able to give such an answer and make such observations as the #subject# might naturally be supposed to produce
happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it that $mrs_jennings$ as she had of late often hoped might be the case had ceased to imagine her at all attached to $mr_edward_ferrars$ and happy above all the rest in the absence of $marianne_dashwood$ she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment and to give her judgment as she believed with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it
she could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last than in the marriage of $mr_edward_ferrars$ and $miss_lucy_steele$
what mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ would say and do though there could not be a doubt of its nature she was anxious to hear and still more anxious to know how $mr_edward_ferrars$ would conduct himself
for him she felt much compassion for $miss_lucy_steele$ very little and it cost her some pains to procure that little for the rest of the party none at all
i have no notion of people making such a to do about money and greatness lord as $mrs_jennings$ could talk on no other #subject# $elinor$ soon saw the necessity of preparing $marianne_dashwood$ for its discussion
no #time# was to be lost in undeceiving her in making her acquainted with the real truth and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her #sister# or any resentment against $mr_edward_ferrars$
her #sister# chief consolation to give such particulars of $mr_edward_ferrars$ as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion and to make $marianne_dashwood$ by a resemblance in their situations which to her fancy would seem strong feel all her own disappointment over again
but unwelcome as such a task must be it was necessary to be done and $elinor$ therefore hastened to perform it
she was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings or to represent herself as suffering much any otherwise than as the self command she had practised since her first #knowledge# of $mr_edward_ferrars$ engagement might suggest a hint of what was practicable to $marianne_dashwood$
her narration was clear and simple and though it could not be given without emotion it was not accompanied by violent agitation nor impetuous grief that belonged rather to the hearer for $marianne_dashwood$ listened with horror and cried excessively
$elinor$ office was a painful one she was going to remove what she really believed to be $elinor$ was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses
no less than in theirs and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind and a very earnest vindication of $mr_edward_ferrars$ from every charge but of imprudence was readily offered
$mr_edward_ferrars$ seemed a second $mrs_willoughby$ and acknowledging as $elinor$ did that she had loved him most sincerely could she feel less than herself
as for $miss_lucy_steele$ she considered her so totally unamiable so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible #man# that she could not be persuaded at first to believe and afterwards to pardon any former affection of $mr_edward_ferrars$ for her
she would not even admit it to have been natural and $elinor$ left her to be convinced that it was so by that which only could convince her a better #knowledge# of mankind
her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement and the length of #time# it had existed $marianne_dashwood$ feelings had then broken in and put an end to all regularity of detail and for some #time# all that could be done was to soothe her distress lessen her alarms and combat her resentment
the first question on her side which led to farther particulars was how long has this been known to you $elinor$ has he written to you
but $marianne_dashwood$ for some #time# would give credit to neither i have known it these four #month# when $miss_lucy_steele$ first came to $barton$ park last november she told me in confidence of her engagement
at these words $marianne_dashwood$ eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter after a pause of wonder she exclaimed four #month# have you known of this four #month#
$elinor$ confirmed it what while attending me in all my misery has this been on your heart and i have reproached you for being happy
it was not fit that you should then know how much i was the reverse four #month# cried $marianne_dashwood$ again so calm so cheerful how
i owed it to her therefore to avoid giving any hint of the truth and i owed it to my family and friends not to create in them a solicitude about me which it could not be in my power to satisfy
have you been supported by feeling that i was doing my #duty# my promise to $miss_lucy_steele$ obliged me to be secret
i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my #mother# added $elinor$ and once or twice i have attempted it but without betraying my trust i never could have convinced you
while the comfort of others was dear to me i was glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt
$marianne_dashwood$ seemed much struck four #month# and yet you loved him yes but i did not love only him and now i can think and speak of it with little emotion
i would not have you suffer on my account for i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself i have many #thing# to support me
i am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own i have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther
i #wish# him very happy and i am so sure of his always doing his #duty# that though now he may harbour some regret in the end he must become so
$miss_lucy_steele$ does not want #sense# and that is the foundation on which every #thing# good may be built and after all $marianne_dashwood$ after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant #attachment# and all that can be said of one happiness depending entirely on any particular person it is not meant it is not fit it is not possible that it should be
so $mr_edward_ferrars$ #will# marry $miss_lucy_steele$ he #will# marry a woman superior in person and understanding to #half# her sex and #time# and habit #will# teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to her
if such is your way of thinking said $marianne_dashwood$ if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else your resolution your self command are perhaps a little less to be wondered
i understand you you do not suppose that i have ever felt much for four #month# $marianne_dashwood$ i have had all this hanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature knowing that it would make you and my #mother# most unhappy whenever it were explained to you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least
it was told me it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects and told me as i thought with triumph
this person suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested and
it has not been only once i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again i have known myself to be divided from $mr_edward_ferrars$ for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire
the connection #nothing# has proved him unworthy nor has anything declared him indifferent to me i have had to contend against the unkindness of his #sister# and the insolence of his #mother# and have suffered the punishment of an #attachment# without enjoying its advantages
and all this has been going on at a #time# when as you know too well it has not been my only unhappiness
i acquit $mr_edward_ferrars$ of essential misconduct at they are brought more within my comprehension if you can think me capable of ever feeling surely you may suppose that i have suffered now
the composure of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the consolation that i have been willing to admit have been the effect of constant and painful exertion they did not spring up of themselves they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first no $marianne_dashwood$ then if i had not been bound to silence perhaps #nothing# could have kept me entirely not even what i owed to my dearest friends from openly shewing that i was very
have i been to you you who have been my only comfort who have borne with me in all my misery who have seemed to be only suffering for me is this my
unhappy $marianne_dashwood$ was quite subdued oh $elinor$ she cried you have made me hate myself for ever how barbarous gratitude is this the only return i can make you because your merit cries out upon myself
in such a frame of mind as she was now in $elinor$ had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required and at her request $marianne_dashwood$ engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness to meet $miss_lucy_steele$ without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her and even to see $mr_edward_ferrars$ himself if chance should bring them together without any diminution of her usual cordiality these were great concessions but
i have been trying to do it away the tenderest caresses followed this confession where $marianne_dashwood$ felt that she had injured no reparation could be too much for her to make
she performed her promise of being discreet to admiration she attended to all that $mrs_jennings$ had to say upon the #subject# with an unchanging complexion dissented from her in #nothing# and was heard three #time# to say yes ma am she listened to her praise of $miss_lucy_steele$ with only moving from one chair to another and
when $mrs_jennings$ talked of $mr_edward_ferrars$ affection it cost her only a spasm in her throat such advances towards heroism in her #sister# made $elinor$ feel equal to any #thing# herself
the next morning brought a farther trial of it in a visit from their brother who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair and bring them news of his wife
you have heard i suppose said he with great solemnity as soon as he was seated of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday
they all looked their assent it seemed too awful a moment for speech your #sister# he continued has suffered dreadfully
mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ too in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress but i #will# hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome
donavan says there is #nothing# materially to be apprehended her constitution is a good one and her resolution equal to any #thing#
poor $fanny$ she was in hysterics all yesterday but i would not alarm you too much she has borne it all with the fortitude of an angel
she says she never shall think well of anybody again and one cannot wonder at it after being so deceived meeting with such ingratitude where so much kindness had been shewn so much confidence had been placed
it was quite out of the benevolence of her heart that she had asked these young women to her #house# merely because she thought they deserved some attention were harmless well behaved girls and would be pleasant companions for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and $marianne_dashwood$ to be with us while your kind friend there was attending her daughter
i #wish# with all my heart says poor $fanny$ in her affectionate way that we had asked your #sister# instead of them
and now to be so rewarded here he stopped to be thanked which being done he went on
while she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him was it to be supposed that he could be all the #time# secretly engaged to another person such
what poor mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ suffered when first $fanny$ broke it to her is not to be described a suspicion could never have entered her head
if she suspected any prepossession elsewhere it could not be in that quarter there to be sure said she i might have thought myself safe
she was quite in an agony we consulted together however as to what should be done and at last she determined to send for $mr_edward_ferrars$
all that mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ could say to make him put an end to the engagement assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments and $fanny$ entreaties was of no avail
he came but i am sorry to relate what ensued #duty# affection every #thing# was disregarded i never thought $mr_edward_ferrars$ so stubborn so unfeeling before
his #mother# explained to him her liberal designs in case of his marrying $miss_morton$ told him she would settle on him the norfolk estate which clear of land tax brings in a good thousand a year offered even when matters grew desperate to make it twelve hundred and in opposition to this if he still persisted in this low connection represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match
his own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all she would never see him again and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it
here $marianne_dashwood$ in an ecstasy of indignation clapped her hands together and cried gracious god can this be possible
well may you wonder $marianne_dashwood$ replied her brother at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these your exclamation is very natural
$marianne_dashwood$ was going to retort but she remembered her promises and forbore all this however he continued was urged in vain
$mr_edward_ferrars$ said very little but what he did say was in the most determined manner #nothing# should prevail on him to give up his engagement
he would stand to it cost him what it might then cried $mrs_jennings$ with blunt sincerity no longer able to be silent he has acted like an honest #man#
i have some little concern in the business as well as yourself for $miss_lucy_steele$ is my cousin and i believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one who more deserves a good husband
$mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ was greatly astonished but his nature was calm not open to provocation and he never wished to offend anybody especially anybody of good #fortune#
i beg your pardon mr $marianne_dashwood$ but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him a rascal he therefore replied without any resentment i would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours madam
$miss_lucy_steele$ is i dare say a very deserving young woman but in the present case you know the connection must be impossible
and to have entered into a secret engagement with a young #man# under her #uncle# care the son of a woman especially of such very large #fortune# as mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ is perhaps altogether a little extraordinary
in short i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for $mrs_jennings$
we all #wish# her extremely happy and mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ conduct throughout the whole has been such as every conscientious good #mother# in like circumstances would adopt
it has been dignified and liberal $mr_edward_ferrars$ has drawn his own lot and i fear it #will# be a bad one
$marianne_dashwood$ sighed out her similar apprehension and $elinor$ heart wrung for the feelings of $mr_edward_ferrars$ while braving his #mother# threats for a woman who could not reward him
well sir said $mrs_jennings$ and how did it end i am sorry to say ma am in a most unhappy rupture $mr_edward_ferrars$ is dismissed for ever from his #mother# notice
he left her #house# yesterday but where he is gone or whether he is still in town i do not know for we of course can make no inquiry
poor young #man# and what is to become of him what indeed ma am it is a melancholy consideration born to the prospect of such affluence
the interest of two thousand pounds how can a #man# live on it and when to that is added the recollection that he might but for his own folly within three #month# have been in the receipt of two thousand five hundred a year for $miss_morton$ has thirty thousand pounds i cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition
we must all feel for him and the more so because it is totally out of our power to assist him
poor young #man# cried $mrs_jennings$ i am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my #house# and so i would tell him if i could see him
i cannot conceive a situation more deplorable it is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now at lodgings and taverns
$elinor$ heart thanked her for such kindness towards $mr_edward_ferrars$ though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it
if he would only have done as well by himself said $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ as all his friends were disposed to do by him he might now have been in his proper situation and would have wanted for #nothing#
but as it is it must be out of anybody power to assist him and there is one #thing# more preparing against him which must be worse than all
his #mother# has determined with a very natural kind of spirit to settle that estate upon $mr_robert_ferrars$ immediately which might have been $mr_edward_ferrars$ on proper conditions
i left her this morning with her lawyer talking over the business well said $mrs_jennings$ that is her revenge everybody has a way of their own
but i dont think mine would be to make one son independent because another had plagued me $marianne_dashwood$ got up and walked about the room
can anything be more galling to the spirit of a #man# continued $mrs_john_dashwood$ than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own
a few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion concluded his visit and with repeated assurances to his #sister# that he really believed there was no material danger in $fanny$ indisposition and that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it he went away leaving the three #lady# unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion as far at least as it regarded mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ conduct the dashwoods and $mr_edward_ferrars$
$marianne_dashwood$ indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in $elinor$ and unnecessary in $mrs_jennings$ they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party
poor $mr_edward_ferrars$ i feel for him sincerely chapter $mrs_jennings$ was very warm in her praise of $mr_edward_ferrars$ conduct but only $elinor$ and $marianne_dashwood$ understood its true merit
they only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient and how small was the consolation beyond the consciousness of doing right that could remain to him in the loss of friends and #fortune#
but though confidence between them was by this public discovery restored to its proper state it was not a #subject# on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone
$elinor$ avoided it upon principle as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts by the too warm too positive assurances of $marianne_dashwood$ that belief of $mr_edward_ferrars$ continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away and $marianne_dashwood$ courage soon failed her in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever by the comparison it necessarily produced between $elinor$ conduct and her own
she felt all the force of that comparison but not as her #sister# had hoped to urge her to exertion now she felt it with all the pain of continual self reproach regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before but it brought only the torture of penitence without the hope of amendment
$elinor$ gloried in his integrity and $marianne_dashwood$ forgave all his offences in compassion for his punishment her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible and therefore it only dispirited her more
but though so much of the matter was known to them already that $mrs_jennings$ might have had enough to do in spreading that #knowledge# farther without seeking after more she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could and #nothing# but the hindrance of more #visitor# than usual had prevented her going to them within that #time#
the third #day# succeeding their #knowledge# of the particulars was so fine so beautiful a sunday as to draw many to kensington gardens though it was only the second week in march
$mrs_jennings$ and $elinor$ were of the number but $marianne_dashwood$ who knew that the willoughbys were again in town and had a constant dread of meeting them chose rather to stay at home than venture into so public a place
an intimate acquaintance of $mrs_jennings$ joined them soon after they entered the gardens and $elinor$ was not sorry that by her continuing with them and engaging all $mrs_jennings$ conversation she was herself left to quiet reflection
she saw #nothing# of the willoughbys #nothing# of $mr_edward_ferrars$ and for some #time# #nothing# of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay be interesting to her
but at last she found herself with some surprise accosted by $miss_lucy_steele$ who though looking rather shy expressed great satisfaction in meeting them and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of $mrs_jennings$ left her own party for a short #time# to join their
#nothing# new was heard by them for a #day# or two afterwards of affairs in harley street or bartlett buildings $mrs_jennings$ immediately whispered to $elinor$ get it all out of her my dear
it was lucky however for $mrs_jennings$ curiosity and $elinor$ too that she would tell any #thing# without being asked for #nothing# would otherwise have been learnt
i am so glad to meet you said $miss_lucy_steele$ taking her familiarly by the arm for i wanted to see you of all #thing# in the world
she #will# tell you any #thing# if you ask you see i cannot leave mrs clarke and then lowering her voice i suppose $mrs_jennings$ has heard all about it
is she angry not at all i believe with you that is a good #thing# and $lady_middleton$ is she angry
i cannot suppose it possible that she should be i am monstrous glad of it good gracious i have had such a #time# of it
she vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet nor do any #thing# else for me again so long as she lived but now she is quite come to and we are as good friends as ever
i never saw $miss_lucy_steele$ in such a rage in my life look she made me this bow to my hat and put in the feather last night
there now you are going to laugh at me too but why should not i wear pink ribbons i do not care if it is the doctor favourite colour
i am sure for my part i should never have known he did like it better than any other colour if he had not happened to say so
my cousins have been so plaguing me i declare sometimes i do not know which way to look before them
she had wandered away to a #subject# on which $elinor$ had #nothing# to say and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first
well but miss $marianne_dashwood$ speaking triumphantly people may say what they chuse about $mr_edward_ferrars$ declaring he would not have $miss_lucy_steele$ for it is no such #thing# i can tell you and it is quite a shame for such ill natured reports to be spread abroad
whatever $miss_lucy_steele$ might think about it herself you know it was no business of other people to set it down for certain
i never heard any #thing# of the kind hinted at before i assure you said $elinor$ oh did not you
but it was said i know very well and by more than one for miss godby told miss sparks that nobody in their #sense# could expect $mr_edward_ferrars$ to give up a woman like $miss_morton$ with thirty thousand pounds to her #fortune# for $miss_lucy_steele$ that had #nothing# at all and i had it from miss sparks myself
and besides that my cousin richard said himself that when it came to the point he was afraid $mr_edward_ferrars$ would be off and when $mr_edward_ferrars$ did not come near us for three #day# i could not tell what to think myself and i believe in my heart $miss_lucy_steele$ gave it up all for lost for we came away from your brother wednesday and we saw #nothing# of him not all thursday friday and saturday and did not know what was become of him
however this morning he came just as we came home from church and then it all came out how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street and been talked to by his #mother# and all of them and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but $miss_lucy_steele$ and nobody
and how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon as he had went away from his #mother# #house# he had got upon his horse and rid into the country some where or other and how he had stayed about at an inn all thursday and friday on purpose to get the better of it
and after thinking it all over and over again he said it seemed to him as if now he had no #fortune# and no #nothing# at all it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement because it must be for her loss for he had #nothing# but two thousand pounds and no hope of any #thing# else and if he was to go into orders as he had some thoughts he could get #nothing# but a curacy and how was they to live upon that he could not bear to think of her doing no better and so he begged if she had the least mind for it to put an end to the matter directly and leave him shift for himself
once $miss_lucy_steele$ thought to write to him but then her spirits rose against that but $miss_lucy_steele$ would he have i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be
and it was entirely for her #sake# and upon her account that he said a word about being off and not upon his own
i #will# take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her or of wishing to marry $miss_morton$ or any #thing# like it
but to be sure $miss_lucy_steele$ would not give ear to such kind of talking so she told him directly with a great deal about sweet and love you know and all that
one cant repeat such kind of #thing# you know she told him directly she had not the least mind in the world to be off for she could live with him upon a trifle and how little so ever he might have she should be very glad to have it all you know or something of the kind
so then he was monstrous happy and talked on some #time# about what they should do and they agreed he should take orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living
and just then i could not hear any more for my cousin called from below to tell me mrs richardson was come in her coach and would take one of us to kensington gardens so i was forced to go into the room and interrupt them to ask $miss_lucy_steele$ if she would like to go but she did not care to leave $mr_edward_ferrars$ so i just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardsons
i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them said $elinor$ you were all in the same room together were not you
oh la no indeed not us la miss $marianne_dashwood$ do you think people make love when any body else is by
laughing affectedly no no they were shut up in the drawing room together and all i heard was only by listening at the door
oh for shame to be sure you must know better than that how cried $elinor$ have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door
i am sorry i did not know it before for i certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself
how could you behave so unfairly by your #sister# oh la there is #nothing# in that i only stood at the door and heard what i could
and i am sure $miss_lucy_steele$ would have done just the same by me for a year or two back when martha sharpe and i had so many secrets together she never made any bones of hiding in a closet or behind a chimney board on purpose to hear what we said
$elinor$ tried to talk of something else but $miss_lucy_steele$ could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes from what was uppermost in her mind
$mr_edward_ferrars$ talks of going to oxford soon said she but now he is lodging at no pall mall
however i shant say anything against them to you and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot which was more than i looked for
and for my part i was all in a fright for fear your #sister# should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a #day# or two before but however #nothing# was said about them and i took care to keep mine out of sight
$mr_edward_ferrars$ have got some business at oxford he says so he must go there for a #time# and after that as soon as he can light upon a bishop he #will# be ordained
what an ill natured woman his #mother# is ant she and your brother and #sister# were not very kind i wonder what curacy he #will# get good gracious
giggling as she spoke i lay my life i know what my cousins #will# say when they hear of it they #will# tell me i should write to the doctor to get $mr_edward_ferrars$ the curacy of his new living
i know they #will# but i am sure i would not do such a #thing# for all the world la i shall say directly i wonder how you could think of such a #thing#
i write to the doctor indeed well said $elinor$ it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst you have got your answer ready
$miss_lucy_steele$ was going to reply on the same #subject# but the approach of her own party made another more necessary
i had a vast deal more to say to you but i must not stay away from them not any longer
oh la here come the richardsons i assure you they are very genteel people he makes a monstrous deal of money and they keep their own coach
i have not #time# to speak to $mrs_jennings$ about it myself but pray tell her i am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us and $lady_middleton$ the same and if anything should happen to take you and your #sister# away and $mrs_jennings$ should want company
i am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a #time# as she likes
i suppose $lady_middleton$ wont ask us any more this bout good by i am sorry miss $marianne_dashwood$ was not here
remember me kindly to her la if you have not got your spotted muslin on i wonder you was not afraid of its being torn
such was her parting concern for after this she had #time# only to pay her farewell compliments to $mrs_jennings$ before her company was claimed by mrs richardson and $elinor$ was left in possession of #knowledge# which might feed her powers of reflection some #time# though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind
$mr_edward_ferrars$ marriage with $miss_lucy_steele$ was as firmly determined on and the #time# of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain as she had concluded it would be every
#thing# depended exactly after her expectation on his getting that preferment of which at present there seemed not the smallest chance
as soon as they returned to the carriage $mrs_jennings$ was eager for information but as $elinor$ wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars as she felt assured that $miss_lucy_steele$ for the #sake# of her own consequence would choose to have known
the continuance of their engagement and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end was all her communication and this produced from $mrs_jennings$ the following natural remark
wait for his having a living ay we all know how that #will# end they #will# wait a twelvemonth and finding no good comes of it #will# set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a year with the interest of his two thousand pounds and what little matter mr steele and mr pratt can give her then they #will# have a child every year
and lord help em how poor they #will# be i must see what i can give them towards furnishing their #house#
two maids and two #man# indeed as i talked oft other #day# no no they must get a stout girl of all works betty #sister# would never do for them now
the next morning brought $elinor$ a #letter# by the two penny post from $miss_lucy_steele$ herself it was as follows bartlett building march
i hope my dear miss $marianne_dashwood$ #will# excuse the liberty i take of writing to her but i know your friendship for me #will# make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear $mr_edward_ferrars$ after all the troubles we have went through lately therefore #will# make no more apologies but proceed to say that thank god
though we have suffered dreadfully we are both quite well now and as happy as we must always be in one another love
we have had great trials and great persecutions but however at the same #time# gratefully acknowledge many friends yourself not the least among them whose great kindness i shall always thankfully remember as #will# $mr_edward_ferrars$ too who i have told of it
i am sure you #will# be glad to hear as likewise dear $mrs_jennings$ i spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon he would not hear of our parting though earnestly did i as i thought my #duty# required urge him to it for prudence #sake# and would have parted for ever on the spot would he consent to it but he said it should never be he did not regard his #mother# anger while he could have my affections our prospects are not very bright to be sure but we must wait and hope for the best he #will# be ordained shortly and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow am very sure you #will# not forget us and
she #will# speak a good word for us to sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ or mr $mrs_palmer$ or any friend that may be able to assist us poor
anne was much to blame for what she did but she did it for the best so i say #nothing# hope $mrs_jennings$ wont think it too much trouble to give us a call should she come this way any morning twould be a great kindness and my cousins would be proud to know her my
paper reminds me to conclude and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her and to sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ and $lady_middleton$ and the dear children when you chance to see them and love to miss $marianne_dashwood$ i am
as soon as $elinor$ had finished it she performed what she concluded to be its writer real design by placing it in the hands of $mrs_jennings$ who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise
dear $mrs_jennings$ too trust very well indeed how prettily she writes aye that was quite proper to let him be off if he would
that was just like $miss_lucy_steele$ poor soul i #wish# i could get him a living with all my heart she calls me dear $mrs_jennings$ you see
she is a good hearted girl as ever lived very well upon my word that sentence is very prettily turned yes yes i #will# go and see her sure enough
how attentive she is to think of every body thank you my dear for shewing it me it is as pretty a #letter# as ever i saw and does $miss_lucy_steele$ head and heart great credit
the miss dashwoods had now been rather more than two #month# in town and $marianne_dashwood$ impatience to be gone increased every #day#
she sighed for the air the liberty the quiet of the country and fancied that if any place could give her ease $barton$ must do it
$elinor$ was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey which $marianne_dashwood$ could not be brought to acknowledge
she began however seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment and had already mentioned their #wish# to their kind hostess who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good #will# when a plan was suggested which though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer appeared to $elinor$ altogether much more eligible than any other
the palmers were to remove to cleveland about the end of march for the easter holidays and $mrs_jennings$ with both her friends received a very warm invitation from charlotte to go with them
it was inforced with so much real politeness by mr $mrs_palmer$ himself as joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her #sister# had been known to be unhappy induced her to accept it with pleasure
chapter this would not in itself have been sufficient for the delicacy of miss $marianne_dashwood$ but when she told $marianne_dashwood$ what she had done however her first reply was not very auspicious
cleveland she cried with great agitation no i cannot go to cleveland you forget said $elinor$ gently that its situation is not that it is not in the neighbourhood of
but it is in somersetshire i cannot go into somersetshire there where i looked forward to going no $elinor$ you cannot expect me to go there
$elinor$ would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others represented it therefore as a measure which would fix the #time# of her returning to that dear #mother# whom she so much wished to see in a more eligible more comfortable manner than any other plan could do and perhaps without any greater delay
from cleveland which was within a few miles of bristol the distance to $barton$ was not beyond one #day# though a long #day# journey and their #mother# servant might easily come there to attend them down and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at cleveland they might now be at home in little more than three weeks #time#
as $marianne_dashwood$ affection for her #mother# was sincere it must triumph with little difficulty over the imaginary evils she had started
$mrs_jennings$ was so far from being weary of her guests that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from cleveland
$elinor$ was grateful for the attention but it could not alter her design and their #mother# concurrence being readily gained every #thing# relative to their return was arranged as far as it could
be and $marianne_dashwood$ found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from $barton$
dashwoods was $mrs_jennings$ address to him when he first called on her after their leaving her was settled for they are quite resolved upon going home from the palmers and
ah colonel i do not know what you and i shall do without the miss how forlorn we shall be when i come back lord
perhaps $mrs_jennings$ was in hopes by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui to provoke him to make that offer which might give himself an escape from it and if so she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained for on $elinor$ moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print which she was going to copy for her friend he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning and conversed with her there for several minutes
the effect of his discourse on the #lady# too could not escape her observation for though she was too honorable to listen and had even changed her seat on purpose that she might not hear to one close by the piano forte on which $marianne_dashwood$ was playing she could not keep herself from seeing that $elinor$ changed colour attended with agitation and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment still farther in confirmation of her hopes in the interval of $marianne_dashwood$ turning from one lesson to another some words of the colonel inevitably reached her ear in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his #house#
we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats this set the matter beyond a doubt
what $elinor$ said in reply she could not distinguish but judged from the motion of her lips that she did not think that any material objection and $mrs_jennings$ commended her in her heart for being so honest
they then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable when another lucky stop in $marianne_dashwood$ performance brought her these words in the colonel calm voice
she wondered indeed at his thinking it necessary to do so but supposed it to be the proper etiquette i am afraid it cannot take place very soon
astonished and shocked at so unlover like a speech she was almost ready to cry out lord what should hinder it but checking her desire confined herself to this silent ejaculation
this delay on the colonel side however did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards and moving different ways $mrs_jennings$ very plainly heard $elinor$ say and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said i shall always think myself very much obliged to you
$mrs_jennings$ was delighted with her gratitude and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence the colonel should be able to take leave of them as he immediately did with the utmost sang froid and go away without making her any reply she had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor
this is very strange sure he need not wait to be older what had really passed between them was to this effect
i have heard said he with great compassion of the injustice your friend $mr_edward_ferrars$ has suffered from his family for if i understand the matter right he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman
the cruelty the impolitic cruelty he replied with great feeling of dividing or attempting to divide two young people long attached to each other is terrible mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ does not know what she may be doing what she may drive her son to
have i been rightly informed is it so $elinor$ told him that it was i have seen $mr_edward_ferrars$ two or three #time# in harley street and am much pleased with him
he is not a young #man# with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short #time# but i have seen enough of him to #wish# him well for his own #sake# and as a friend of yours i #wish# it still more
#will# you be so good as to tell him that the living of delaford now just vacant as i am informed by this #day# post is his if he think it worth his acceptance but that perhaps so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now it may be nonsense to appear to doubt i only #wish# it were more valuable
it is a rectory but a small one the late incumbent i believe did not make more than per annum and though it is certainly capable of improvement i fear not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income
i understand that he intends to take orders such as it is however my pleasure in presenting it to him #will# be very great
$elinor$ astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater had the colonel been really making her an offer of his hand
the preferment which only two #day# before she had considered as hopeless for $mr_edward_ferrars$ was already provided to enable him to marry and she of all people in the world was fixed on to bestow it her emotion was such as $mrs_jennings$ had attributed to a very different
whatever minor feelings less pure less pleasing might have a share in that emotion her esteem for the general benevolence and her gratitude for the particular friendship which together prompted colonel $mrs_brandon$ to this act were strongly felt and warmly expressed
she thanked him for it with all her heart spoke of $mr_edward_ferrars$ principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure if it were really his #wish# to put off so agreeable an office to another
pray assure him of it cause but but at the same #time# she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself
it was an office in short from which unwilling to give $mr_edward_ferrars$ the pain of receiving an obligation from her she would have been very glad to be spared herself but colonel $mrs_brandon$ on motives of equal delicacy declining it likewise still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means that she would not on any account make farther opposition
$mr_edward_ferrars$ she believed was still in town and fortunately she had heard his address from $miss_lucy_steele$ she could undertake therefore to inform him of it in the course of the #day#
after this had been settled colonel $mrs_brandon$ began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour and then it was that he mentioned with regret that the #house# was small and indifferent an evil which $elinor$ as $mrs_jennings$ had supposed her to do made very light of at least as far as regarded its size
the smallness of the #house# said she i cannot imagine any inconvenience to them for it #will# be in proportion to their family and income
by which the colonel was surprised to find that she was considering $mr_edward_ferrars$ marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation for he did not suppose it possible that delaford living could supply such an income as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on and he said so
this little rectory can do no more than make $mr_edward_ferrars$ comfortable as a bachelor it cannot enable him to marry
i am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this and my interest is hardly more extensive
if however by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther i must think very differently of him from what i now do if i am not as ready to be useful to him then as i sincerely #wish# i could be at present
what i am now doing indeed seems #nothing# at all since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal his only object of happiness
such was the sentence which when misunderstood so justly offended the delicate feelings of $mrs_jennings$ but after this narration of what really passed between colonel $mrs_brandon$ and $elinor$ while they stood at the window the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting may perhaps appear in general not less reasonably excited nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage
his marriage must still be a distant good at least i am afraid it cannot take place very soon chapter
well miss $marianne_dashwood$ said $mrs_jennings$ sagaciously smiling as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn i do not ask you what the colonel has been saying to you for though upon my honour i tried to keep out of hearing i could not help catching enough to understand his business
and i assure you i never was better pleased in my life and i #wish# you joy of it with all my heart
thank you ma am said $elinor$ it is a matter of great joy to me and i feel the goodness of colonel $mrs_brandon$ most sensibly
there are not many #man# who would act as he has done few people who have so compassionate a heart i never was more astonished in my life
i ant the least astonished at it in the world for i have often thought of late there was #nothing# more likely to happen
you judged from your #knowledge# of the colonel general benevolence but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur
as to that when a #man# has once made up his mind to such a #thing# somehow or other he #will# soon find an opportunity
well my dear i #wish# you joy of it again and again and if ever there was a happy couple in the world i think i shall soon know where to look for them
lord my dear you are very modest opportunity repeated $mrs_jennings$ oh you mean to go to delaford after them
and as to the #house# being a bad one i do not know what the colonel would be at for it is as good a one as ever i saw
i suppose said $elinor$ with a faint smile aye my dear that i do indeed he spoke of its being out of repair
they were interrupted by the servant coming in to announce the carriage being at the door and $mrs_jennings$ immediately preparing to go said
well and whose fault is that why dont he repair it who should do it but himself well my dear i must be gone before i have had #half# my talk out
i do not ask you to go with me for i dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company and besides you must long to tell your #sister# all about it
but however we may have it all over in the evening for we shall be quite alone $marianne_dashwood$ had left the room before the conversation began
certainly ma am i shall tell $marianne_dashwood$ of it but i shall not mention it at present to any body else
oh very well said $mrs_jennings$ rather disappointed then you would not have me tell it to $miss_lucy_steele$ for i think of going as far as holborn to #day#
one #day# delay #will# not be very material and till i have written to $mr_edward_ferrars$ i think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else
it is of importance that no #time# should be lost with him for he #will# of course have much to do relative to his ordination
no ma am not even $miss_lucy_steele$ if you please i shall do that directly this speech at first puzzled $mrs_jennings$ exceedingly
why $mr_edward_ferrars$ was to have been written to about it in such a hurry she could not immediately comprehend a few moments reflection however produced a very happy idea and she exclaimed oh ho i understand you
ay to be sure he must be ordained in readiness and i am very glad to find #thing# are so forward between you
$mr_edward_ferrars$ is to be the #man# well so much the better for him but my dear is not this rather out of character
$elinor$ did not quite understand the beginning of $mrs_jennings$ speech neither did she think it worth inquiring into and therefore only replied to its conclusion
colonel $mrs_brandon$ is so delicate a #man# that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to $mr_edward_ferrars$ than himself
should not the colonel write himself sure he is the proper person and so you are forced to do it
well that is an odd kind of delicacy however i #will# not disturb you seeing her preparing to write you know your own concerns best
so goodby my dear i have not heard of any #thing# to please me so well since charlotte was brought to bed
and away she went but returning again in a moment i have just been thinking of betty #sister# my dear
i should be very glad to get her so good a mistress but whether she would do for a #lady# maid i am sure i cant tell
she is an excellent housemaid and works very well at her needle however you #will# think of all that at your leisure
certainly ma am replied $elinor$ not hearing much of what she said and more anxious to be alone than to be mistress of the #subject#
the particular circumstances between them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have been the easiest #thing# in the world but she equally feared to say too much or too little and sat deliberating over her paper with the pen in her hand till broken in on by the entrance of $mr_edward_ferrars$ himself
he had met $mrs_jennings$ at the door in her way to the carriage as he came to leave his farewell card and she after apologising for not returning herself had obliged him to enter by saying that miss $marianne_dashwood$ was above and wanted to speak with him on very particular business
how she should begin how she should express herself in her note to $mr_edward_ferrars$ was now all her concern $elinor$ had just been congratulating herself in the midst of her perplexity
that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by #letter# it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth when her #visitor# entered to force her upon this greatest exertion of all
she had not seen him before since his engagement became public and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it which with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of and what she had to tell him made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes
her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance he too was much distressed and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment whether
he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room he could not recollect but determining to be on the safe side he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any #thing# after taking a chair
$mrs_jennings$ told me said he that you wished to speak with me at least i understood her so or i certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner though at the same #time# i should have been extremely sorry to leave london without seeing you and your #sister# especially as it #will# most likely be some #time# it is not probable that i should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again
you would not have gone however said $elinor$ recovering herself and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible without receiving our good #wish# even if we had not been able to give them in person
i go to oxford tomorrow $mrs_jennings$ was quite right in what she said i have something of consequence to inform you of which i was on the point of communicating by paper
colonel $mrs_brandon$ who was here only ten minutes ago has desired me to say that understanding you mean to take orders he has great pleasure in offering you the living of delaford now just vacant and only #wish# it were more valuable
allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well judging a friend and to join in his #wish# that the living it is about two hundred a year were much more considerable and such as might better enable you to as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself such in short as might establish all your views of happiness
what $mr_edward_ferrars$ felt as he could not say it himself it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him
he looked all the astonishment which such unexpected such unthought of information could not fail of exciting but he said only these two words colonel $mrs_brandon$
yes continued $elinor$ gathering more resolution as some of the worst was over colonel $mrs_brandon$ means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you a concern which i am sure
$marianne_dashwood$ myself and all your friends must share and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion
i am charged with a most agreeable office breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke colonel $mrs_brandon$ give me a living can
no replied he with sudden consciousness not to find it in you for i cannot be ignorant that to you to your goodness i owe it all i feel it
it be possible the unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where i would express it if i could but as you well know i am no orator
i do assure you that you owe it entirely at least almost entirely to your own merit and colonel $mrs_brandon$ discernment of it
i did not even know till i understood his design that the living was vacant nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift
as a friend of mine of my family he may perhaps indeed i know he has still greater pleasure in bestowing it but upon my word you owe #nothing# to my solicitation
truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action but she was at the same #time# so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of $mr_edward_ferrars$ that she acknowledged it with hesitation which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it
for a short #time# he sat deep in thought after $elinor$ had ceased to speak at last and as if it were rather an effort he said colonel $mrs_brandon$ seems a #man# of great worth and respectability
you are very much mistaken i have had no hand in it i have always heard him spoken of as such and your brother i know esteems him highly
indeed replied $elinor$ i believe that you #will# find him on farther acquaintance all that you have heard him to be and as you #will# be such very near neighbours
for i understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion #house# it is particularly important that he should be all this
$mr_edward_ferrars$ made no answer but when she had turned away her head gave her a look so serious so earnest so uncheerful as seemed to say that he might hereafter #wish# the distance between the parsonage and the mansion #house# much greater
he is undoubtedly a sensible #man# and in his manners perfectly the gentleman colonel $mrs_brandon$ i think lodges in st james street said he soon afterwards rising from his chair
i must hurry away then to give him those thanks which you #will# not allow me to give you to assure him that he has made me a very an exceedingly happy #man#
$elinor$ did not offer to detain him and they parted with a very earnest assurance on her side of her unceasing good #wish# for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him on his with rather an attempt to return the same good #will# than the power of expressing it
when i see him again said $elinor$ to herself as the door shut him out i shall see him the husband of $miss_lucy_steele$
and with this pleasing anticipation she sat down to reconsider the past recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of $mr_edward_ferrars$ and of course to reflect on her own with discontent
when $mrs_jennings$ came home though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession than by anything else that she reverted to it again as soon as $elinor$ appeared
$elinor$ told him the number of the #house# well my dear she cried i sent you up the young #man#
did not i do right and i suppose you had no great difficulty you did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal
no ma am that was not very likely well and how soon #will# he be ready for it seems all to depend upon that
really said $elinor$ i know so little of these kind of forms that i can hardly even conjecture as to the #time# or the preparation necessary but i suppose two or three #month# #will# complete his ordination
two or three #month# cried $mrs_jennings$ lord my dear how calmly you talk of it and can the colonel wait two or three #month#
lord bless me i am sure it would put me quite out of patience and though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor $mr_edward_ferrars$
i do think it is not worth while to wait two or three #month# for him sure somebody else might be found that would do as well somebody that is in orders already
my dear ma am said $elinor$ what can you be thinking of why colonel $mrs_brandon$ only object is to be of use to $mr_edward_ferrars$
lord bless you my dear sure you do not mean to persuade me that the colonel only marries you for the #sake# of giving ten guineas to $mr_edward_ferrars$
the deception could not continue after this and an explanation immediately took place by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment without any material loss of happiness to either for $mrs_jennings$ only exchanged one form of delight for another and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first
aye aye the parsonage is but a small one said she after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over and very likely may be out of repair but to hear a #man# apologising as i thought for a #house# that to my #knowledge# has five sitting rooms on the ground floor and i think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds and to you too that had been used to live in $barton$
but my dear we must touch up the colonel to do some #thing# to the parsonage and make it comfortable for them before $miss_lucy_steele$ goes to it
cottage it seems quite ridiculous but colonel $mrs_brandon$ does not seem to have any idea of the living being enough to allow them to marry
the colonel is a ninny my dear because he has two thousand a year himself he thinks that nobody else can marry on less
take my word for it that if i am alive i shall be paying a visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas and i am sure i shant go if $miss_lucy_steele$ ant there
chapter $mr_edward_ferrars$ having carried his thanks to colonel $mrs_brandon$ proceeded with his happiness to $miss_lucy_steele$ and such was the excess of it by the #time# he reached bartlett buildings that she was able to assure $mrs_jennings$ who called on her again the next #day# with her congratulations that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life
her own happiness and her own spirits were at least very certain and she joined $mrs_jennings$ most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in delaford parsonage before michaelmas
so far was she at the same #time# from any backwardness to give $elinor$ that credit which $mr_edward_ferrars$ would give her that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth was ready to own all their obligation to her and openly declared that no exertion for their good on miss $marianne_dashwood$ part either present or future would ever surprise her for she believed her capable of doing any #thing# in the world for those she really valued
as for colonel $mrs_brandon$ she was not only ready to worship him as a saint but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost and scarcely resolved to avail herself at delaford as far as she possibly could of his servants his carriage his cows and his poultry
it was now above a week since $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ had called in berkeley street and as since that #time# no notice had been taken by them of his wife indisposition beyond one verbal enquiry $elinor$ began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit this was an obligation however which not only opposed her own inclination but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions
$marianne_dashwood$ not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself was very urgent to prevent her #sister# going at all and $mrs_jennings$ though her carriage was always at $elinor$ service so very much disliked mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery nor her strong desire to affront her by taking $mr_edward_ferrars$ part could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again
the consequence was that $elinor$ set out by herself to pay a visit for which no one could really have less inclination and to run the risk of a tete a tete with a woman whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike
$elinor$ was quite of her opinion as to the probability of their not waiting for any #thing# more mrs $marianne_dashwood$ was denied but before the carriage could turn from the #house# her husband accidentally came out
he expressed great pleasure in meeting $elinor$ told her that he had been just going to call in berkeley street and assuring her that $fanny$ would be very glad to see her invited her to come in
$fanny$ is in her own room i suppose said he i #will# go to her presently for i am sure she #will# not have the least objection in the world to seeing you very far from it indeed
they walked up stairs in to the drawing room nobody was there now especially there cannot be but however you and $marianne_dashwood$ were always great
favourites why would not $marianne_dashwood$ come $elinor$ made what excuse she could for her i am not sorry to see you alone he replied for i have a good deal to say to you
he really given it to $mr_edward_ferrars$ i heard it yesterday by chance and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it
this living of colonel $mrs_brandon$ can it be true has it is perfectly true colonel $mrs_brandon$ has given the living of delaford to $mr_edward_ferrars$
really well this is very astonishing no relationship no connection between them and now that livings fetch such a price what was the value of this
very well and for the next presentation to a living of that value supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly and likely to vacate it soon he might have got i dare say
about two hundred a year fourteen hundred pounds and how came he not to have settled that matter before this person death now
indeed it would be too late to sell it but a #man# of colonel $mrs_brandon$ #sense# i wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common such natural concern well i am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character
$mr_edward_ferrars$ is only to hold the living till the person to whom the colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough to take it aye aye that is the fact depend upon it
$elinor$ contradicted it however very positively and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from colonel $mrs_brandon$ to $mr_edward_ferrars$ and therefore must understand the terms on which it was given obliged him to submit to her authority
i suppose however on recollection that the case may probably be this it is truly astonishing he cried after hearing what she said what could be the colonel motive
well well whatever colonel $mrs_brandon$ may be $mr_edward_ferrars$ is a very lucky #man# you #will# not mention the matter to $fanny$ however for though i have broke it to her and she bears it vastly well she #will# not like to hear it much talked of
$elinor$ had some difficulty here to refrain from observing that she thought $fanny$ might have borne with composure an acquisition of wealth to her brother by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished
mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ added he lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a #subject# knows #nothing# about it at present and i believe it #will# be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be when the marriage takes place i fear she must hear of it all
a very simple one to be of use to $mr_edward_ferrars$ but why should such precaution be used though
it is not to be supposed that mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon for
that must be quite out of the question yet why upon her late behaviour is she supposed to feel at all she
has done with her son she cast him off for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise
surely after doing so she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of #sorrow# or of joy on his account she cannot be interested in any #thing# that befalls him
she would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child and yet retain the anxiety of a parent
when $mr_edward_ferrars$ unhappy match takes place depend upon it his #mother# #will# feel as much as if she had never discarded him and therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event must be concealed from her as much as possible
ah $elinor$ said $mrs_john_dashwood$ your reasoning is very good but it is founded on ignorance of human nature mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ can never forget that $mr_edward_ferrars$ is her son
you surprise me i should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by this #time# you wrong her exceedingly
mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ is one of the most affectionate #mother# in the world $elinor$ was silent we think now said mr $marianne_dashwood$ after a short pause of $mr_robert_ferrars$ marrying $miss_morton$
$elinor$ smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother tone calmly replied the #lady# i suppose has no choice in the affair
i only mean that i suppose from your manner of speaking it must be the same to $miss_morton$ whether she marry $mr_edward_ferrars$ or $mr_robert_ferrars$
certainly there can be no difference for $mr_robert_ferrars$ #will# now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son and as to any #thing# else they are both very agreeable young #man# i do not know that one is superior to the other
choice how do you mean $elinor$ said no more and $mrs_john_dashwood$ was also for a short #time# silent his reflections ended thus
of one #thing# my dear #sister# kindly taking her hand and speaking in an awful whisper i may assure you and i #will# do it because i know it must gratify you
i have good reason to think indeed i have it from the best authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any #thing# about it but i have it from the very best authority not that i ever precisely heard mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ say it herself but her daughter did and i have it from her
you understand me it would have been far preferable to her it would not have given her #half# the vexation that this does
i was exceedingly pleased to hear that mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ considered it in that light a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all
it would have been beyond comparison she said the least evil of the two and she would be glad to compound now for #nothing# worse
but however all that is quite out of the question not to be thought of or mentioned as to any #attachment# you know it never could be all that is gone by
that in short whatever objections there might be against a certain a certain connection but i thought i would just tell you of this because i knew how much it must please you
not that you have any reason to regret my dear $elinor$ there is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well quite as well or better perhaps all #thing# considered
$elinor$ had heard enough if not to gratify her vanity and raise her self importance to agitate her nerves and fill her
she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself and from the danger of hearing any #thing# more from her brother by the entrance of mr $mr_robert_ferrars$ $mr_edward_ferrars$
after a few moments chat $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ recollecting that $fanny$ was yet uninformed of her #sister# being there quitted the room in quest of her and $elinor$ was left to improve her acquaintance with $mr_robert_ferrars$ who by the gay unconcern the happy self complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his #mother# love and liberality to the prejudice of his banished brother earned only by his own dissipated course of life and that brother integrity was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart
they had scarcely been two minutes by themselves before he began to speak of $mr_edward_ferrars$ for he too had heard of the living and was very inquisitive on the #subject#
$elinor$ repeated the particulars of it as she had given them to $mrs_john_dashwood$ and their effect on $mr_robert_ferrars$ though very different was not less striking than it had been on him
the idea of $mr_edward_ferrars$ being a clergyman and living in a small parsonage #house# diverted him beyond measure and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of $mr_edward_ferrars$ reading prayers in a white surplice and publishing the banns of marriage between $mrs_john_dashwood$ $mrs_smith$ and mary brown he could conceive #nothing# more ridiculous
$elinor$ while she waited in silence and immovable gravity the conclusion of such folly could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited
has colonel $mrs_brandon$ been with you lately mind and he laughed most immoderately it was a look however very well bestowed for it relieved her own feelings and gave no intelligence to him
we may treat it as a joke said he at last recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment but upon my soul it is a most serious business
he was recalled from wit to wisdom not by any reproof of hers but by his own sensibility poor $mr_edward_ferrars$
i am extremely sorry for it for i know him to be a very good hearted creature as well meaning a fellow perhaps as any in the world
he is ruined for ever you must not judge of him miss $marianne_dashwood$ from your slight acquaintance poor $mr_edward_ferrars$ his manners are certainly not the happiest in nature but
we are not all born you know with the same powers the same address poor fellow to see him in a circle of strangers to be sure it was pitiable enough but upon my soul
i believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom and i declare and protest to you
my #mother# was the first person who told me of it and i feeling myself called on to act with resolution immediately said to her my dear madam i do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion but as for myself i must say that if $mr_edward_ferrars$ does marry this young woman i never #will# see him again
i never was so shocked in my life as when it all burst forth i could not believe it that was what i said
i was most uncommonly shocked indeed poor $mr_edward_ferrars$ he has done for himself completely shut himself out for ever from all decent society but as i directly said to my #mother# i am not in the least surprised at it from his style of education it was always to be expected
yes once while she was staying in this #house# i happened to drop in for ten minutes and i saw quite enough of her
immediately my poor #mother# was #half# frantic have you ever seen the #lady# the merest awkward country girl without style or elegance and almost without beauty
i offered immediately as soon as my #mother# related the affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuade him from the match but it was too late then i found to do any #thing# for unluckily i was not in the way at first and knew #nothing# of it till after the breach had taken place when it was not for me you know to interfere
but had i been informed of it a few hours earlier i think it is most probable that something might have been hit on
i remember her perfectly just the kind of girl i should suppose likely to captivate poor $mr_edward_ferrars$ i certainly should have represented it to $mr_edward_ferrars$ in a very strong light
my dear fellow i should have said consider what you are doing you are making a most disgraceful connection and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving
i cannot help thinking in short that means might have been found but now it is all too late he must be starved
he had just settled this point with great composure when the entrance of mrs $mrs_john_dashwood$ $marianne_dashwood$ put an end to the #subject#
but though she never spoke of it out of her own family $elinor$ could see its influence on her mind in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself
she even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that $elinor$ and her #sister# were so soon to leave town as she had hoped to see more of them an exertion in which her husband who attended her into the room and hung enamoured over her accents seemed to distinguish every #thing# that was most affectionate and graceful
one other short call in harley street in which $elinor$ received her brother congratulations on their travelling so far towards $barton$ without any expense and on colonel $mrs_brandon$ being to follow them to cleveland in a #day# or two completed the intercourse of the brother and #sister# in town and a faint invitation from $fanny$ to come to norland whenever it should happen to be in their way which of all #thing# was the most unlikely to occur with a more warm though less public assurance from $mrs_john_dashwood$ to $elinor$ of the promptitude with which he should come to see her at delaford was all that foretold any meeting in the country
it amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send her to delaford a place in which of all others she would now least chuse to visit or #wish# to reside for not only was it considered as her future home by her brother and $mrs_jennings$ but even $miss_lucy_steele$ when they parted gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there
very early in april and tolerably early in the #day# the two parties from hanover square and berkeley street set out from their respective homes to meet by appointment on the road
for the convenience of charlotte and her child they were to be more than two #day# on their journey and mr $mrs_palmer$ travelling more expeditiously with colonel $mrs_brandon$ was to join them at cleveland soon after their arrival
$marianne_dashwood$ few as had been her hours of comfort in london and eager as she had long been to quit it could not when it came to the point bid adieu to the #house# in which she had for the last #time# enjoyed those hopes and that confidence in $mrs_willoughby$ which were now extinguished for ever without great pain
nor could she leave the place in which $mrs_willoughby$ remained busy in new engagements and new schemes in which she could have no share without shedding many tears
she had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on she left no creature behind from whom it would give her a moment regret to be divided for ever she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of $miss_lucy_steele$ friendship she was grateful for bringing her #sister# away unseen by $mrs_willoughby$ since his marriage and she looked forward with hope to what a few #month# of tranquility at $barton$ might do towards restoring $marianne_dashwood$ peace of mind and confirming her own
you know that is certain absolutely starved chapter $elinor$ satisfaction at the moment of removal was more positive their journey was safely performed
the second #day# brought them into the cherished or the prohibited county of somerset for as such was it dwelt on by turns in $marianne_dashwood$ imagination and in the forenoon of the third they drove up to cleveland
it had no park but the pleasure grounds were tolerably extensive and like every other place of the same degree of importance it had its open shrubbery and closer wood walk a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation led to the front the lawn was dotted over with timber the #house# itself was under the guardianship of the fir the mountain ash and the acacia and a thick screen of them altogether interspersed with tall lombardy poplars shut out the offices
$marianne_dashwood$ entered the #house# with a heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty miles from $barton$ and not thirty from $combe_magna$ and before she had been five minutes within its walls while the others were busily helping charlotte to show her child to the housekeeper she quitted it again stealing away through the winding shrubberies now just beginning to be in beauty to gain a distant eminence where from its grecian temple her eye wandering over a wide tract of country to the south east could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon and fancy that from their summits
in such moments of precious invaluable misery she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at cleveland and as she returned by a different circuit to the #house# feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude she resolved to spend almost every hour of every #day# while she remained with the palmers in the indulgence of such solitary rambles
she returned just in #time# to join the others as they quitted the #house# on an excursion through its more immediate premises and the rest of the morning was easily whiled away in lounging round the kitchen garden examining the bloom upon its walls and listening to the gardener lamentations upon blights in dawdling through the green #house# where the loss of her favourite plants unwarily exposed and nipped by the lingering frost raised the laughter of charlotte and in visiting her poultry yard where in the disappointed hopes of her dairy maid by hens forsaking their nests or being stolen by a fox or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood she found fresh sources of merriment
the morning was fine and dry and $marianne_dashwood$ in her plan of employment abroad had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay at cleveland
cleveland was a spacious modern built #house# situated on a sloping lawn $combe_magna$ might be seen with great surprise therefore did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner
she had depended on a twilight walk to the grecian temple and perhaps all over the grounds and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it but a heavy and settled rain
even she could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking their party was small and the hours passed quietly away
$mrs_palmer$ had her child and $mrs_jennings$ her carpet work they talked of the friends they had left behind arranged $lady_middleton$ engagements and wondered whether mr $mrs_palmer$ and colonel $mrs_brandon$ would get farther than reading that night
$elinor$ however little concerned in it joined in their discourse and $marianne_dashwood$ who had the knack of finding her way in every #house# to the library however it might be avoided by the family in general soon procured herself a book
#nothing# was wanting on $mrs_palmer$ side that constant and friendly good humour could do to make them feel themselves welcome
the openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms of politeness her kindness recommended by so pretty a face was engaging her folly though evident was not disgusting because it was not conceited and $elinor$ could have forgiven every #thing# but her laugh
the two gentlemen arrived the next #day# to a very late dinner affording a pleasant enlargement of the party and a very welcome variety to their conversation which a long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low
$elinor$ had seen so little of mr $mrs_palmer$ and in that little had seen so much variety in his address to her #sister# and herself that she knew not what to expect to find him in his own family
she found him however perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his #visitor# and only occasionally rude to his wife and her #mother# she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion and only prevented from being so always by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general as he must feel himself to be to $mrs_jennings$ and charlotte
for the rest of his character and habits they were marked as far as $elinor$ could perceive with no traits at all unusual in his sex and #time# of life
he was nice in his eating uncertain in his hours fond of his child though affecting to slight it and idled away the mornings at billiards which ought to have been devoted to business
she liked him however upon the whole much better than she had expected and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more not sorry to be driven by the observation of his epicurism his selfishness and his conceit to rest with complacency on the remembrance of $mr_edward_ferrars$ generous temper simple taste and diffident feelings
of $mr_edward_ferrars$ or at least of some of his concerns she now received intelligence from colonel $mrs_brandon$ who had been into dorsetshire lately and who treating her at once as the disinterested friend of $mr_edward_ferrars$ and the kind confidante of himself talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at delaford described its deficiencies and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them his behaviour to her in this as well as in every other particular his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten #day# his readiness to converse with her and his deference for her opinion might very well justify $mrs_jennings$ persuasion of his #attachment# and would have been enough perhaps had not $elinor$ still as from the first believed $marianne_dashwood$ his real favourite to make her suspect it herself
but as it was such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head except by $mrs_jennings$ suggestion and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two she watched his eyes while $mrs_jennings$ thought only of his behaviour and while his looks of anxious solicitude on $marianne_dashwood$ feeling in her head and throat the beginning of a heavy cold because unexpressed by words entirely escaped the latter #lady# observation she could discover in them the quick feelings and needless alarm of a lover
two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery but all over the grounds and especially in the most distant parts of them where there was something more of wildness than in the rest where the trees were the oldest and the grass was the longest and wettest had assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings given $marianne_dashwood$ a cold so violent as though for a #day# or two trifled with or denied would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body and the notice of herself
though heavy and feverish with a pain in her limbs and a cough and a sore throat a good night rest was to cure her entirely and it was with difficulty that $elinor$ prevailed on her when she went to bed to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies
$marianne_dashwood$ got up the next morning at her usual #time# to every inquiry replied that she was better and tried to prove herself so by engaging in her accustomary employments
but a #day# spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand which she was unable to read or in lying weary and languid on a sofa did not speak much in favour of her amendment and when at last she went early to bed more and more indisposed colonel $mrs_brandon$ was only astonished at her #sister# composure who though attending and nursing her the whole #day# against $marianne_dashwood$ inclination and forcing proper medicines on her at night trusted like $marianne_dashwood$ to the certainty and efficacy of sleep and felt no real alarm
a very restless and feverish night however disappointed the expectation of both and when $marianne_dashwood$ after persisting in rising confessed herself unable to sit up and returned voluntarily to her bed $elinor$ was very ready to adopt $mrs_jennings$ advice of sending for the palmers apothecary
he came examined his patient and though encouraging miss $marianne_dashwood$ to expect that a very few #day# would restore her #sister# to health yet by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency and allowing the word infection to pass his lips gave instant alarm to $mrs_palmer$ on her baby account
$mrs_jennings$ who had been inclined from the first to think $marianne_dashwood$ complaint more serious than $elinor$ now looked very grave on $mr_harris$ report and confirming charlotte fears and caution urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant and mr $mrs_palmer$ though treating their apprehensions as idle found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood
her departure therefore was fixed on and within an hour after $mr_harris$ arrival she set off with her little boy and his nurse for the #house# of a near relation of mr $mrs_palmer$ who lived a few miles on the other side of bath whither her husband promised at her earnest entreaty to join her in a #day# or two and whither she was almost equally urgent with her #mother# to accompany her
$mrs_jennings$ however with a kindness of heart which made $elinor$ really love her declared her resolution of not stirring from cleveland as long as $marianne_dashwood$ remained ill and of endeavouring by her own attentive care to supply to her the place of the #mother# she had taken her from and $elinor$ found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate desirous to share in all her fatigues and often by her better experience in nursing of material use
poor $marianne_dashwood$ languid and low from the nature of her malady and feeling herself universally ill could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced but for this unlucky illness made every ailment severe for on that #day# they were to have begun their journey home and attended the whole way by a servant of $mrs_jennings$ were to have taken their #mother# by surprise on the following forenoon
the little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay though $elinor$ tried to raise her spirits and make her believe as she then really believed herself that it would be a very short one
the next #day# produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient she certainly was not better and except that there was no amendment did not appear worse
their party was now farther reduced for mr $mrs_palmer$ though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good nature as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife was persuaded at last by colonel $mrs_brandon$ to perform his promise of following her and while he was preparing to go colonel $mrs_brandon$ himself with a much greater exertion began to talk of going likewise here however the kindness of $mrs_jennings$ interposed most acceptably for to send the colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her #sister# account would be to deprive them both she thought of every comfort and therefore telling him at once that his stay at cleveland was necessary to herself that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening while miss $marianne_dashwood$ was above with her #sister#
she urged him so strongly to remain that he who was gratifying the first #wish# of his own heart by a compliance could not long even affect to demur especially as $mrs_jennings$ entreaty was warmly seconded by mr $mrs_palmer$ who seemed to feel a relief to himself in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise miss $marianne_dashwood$ in any emergence
prescriptions poured in from all quarters and as usual were all declined chapter $marianne_dashwood$ was of course kept in ignorance of all these arrangements
she knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of cleveland away in about seven #day# from the #time# of their arrival
it gave her no surprise that she saw #nothing# of $mrs_palmer$ and as it gave her likewise no concern she never mentioned her name
$mr_harris$ who attended her every #day# still talked boldly of a speedy recovery and miss $marianne_dashwood$ was equally sanguine but the expectation of the others was by no means so cheerful
$mrs_jennings$ had determined very early in the seizure that $marianne_dashwood$ would never get over it and colonel $mrs_brandon$ who was chiefly of use in listening to $mrs_jennings$ forebodings was not in a state of mind to resist their influence
he tried to reason himself out of fears which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd but the many hours of each #day# in which he was left entirely alone were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see $marianne_dashwood$ no more
on the morning of the third #day# however the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away for when $mr_harris$ arrived he declared his patient materially better
two #day# passed away from the #time# of mr $mrs_palmer$ departure and her situation continued with little variation the same her pulse was much stronger and every symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit
$elinor$ confirmed in every pleasant hope was all cheerfulness rejoicing that in her #letter# to her #mother# she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at cleveland and almost fixing on the #time# when $marianne_dashwood$ would be able to travel
but the #day# did not close so auspiciously as it began towards the evening $marianne_dashwood$ became ill again growing more heavy restless and uncomfortable than before
her #sister# however still sanguine was willing to attribute the change to #nothing# more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made and carefully administering the cordials prescribed saw her with satisfaction sink at last into a slumber from which she expected the most beneficial effects
her sleep though not so quiet as $elinor$ wished to see it lasted a considerable #time# and anxious to observe the result of it herself she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it
$mrs_jennings$ knowing #nothing# of any change in the patient went unusually early to bed her maid who was one of the principal nurses was recreating herself in the housekeeper room and $elinor$ remained alone with $marianne_dashwood$
the repose of the latter became more and more disturbed and her #sister# who watched with unremitting attention her continual change of posture and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber when $marianne_dashwood$ suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the #house# started hastily up and with feverish wildness cried out
not yet cried the other concealing her terror and assisting $marianne_dashwood$ to lie down again but she #will# be here i hope before it is long
is mama coming it is a great way you know from hence to $barton$ but she must not go round by london cried $marianne_dashwood$ in the same hurried manner
i shall never see her if she goes by london $elinor$ perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself and while attempting to soothe her eagerly felt her pulse
and $marianne_dashwood$ still talking wildly of mama her alarm increased so rapidly as to determine her on sending instantly for $mr_harris$ and despatching a messenger to $barton$ for her #mother#
to consult with colonel $mrs_brandon$ on the best means of effecting the latter was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her #sister# she hastened down to the drawing room where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present
it was lower and quicker than ever it was no #time# for hesitation her fears and her difficulties were immediately before him
her difficulties were instantly obviated for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion and the service pre arranged in his mind he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch mrs $marianne_dashwood$
her fears he had no courage no confidence to attempt the removal of he listened to them in silent despondence but $elinor$ made no resistance that was not easily overcome
she thanked him with brief though fervent gratitude and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to $mr_harris$ and an order for post horses directly she wrote a few lines to her #mother#
the comfort of such a friend at that moment as colonel $mrs_brandon$ or such a companion for her #mother# how gratefully was it
felt a companion whose judgment would guide whose attendance must relieve and whose friendship might soothe her as far as the shock of such a summons could be lessened to her his presence his manners his assistance would lessen it
he meanwhile whatever he might feel acted with all the firmness of a collected mind made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch and calculated with exactness the #time# in which she might look for his return
the horses arrived even before they were expected and colonel $mrs_brandon$ only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear hurried into the carriage
it was then about twelve clock and she returned to her #sister# apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary and to watch by her the rest of the night
hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on $marianne_dashwood$ side and in the most cruel anxiety on $elinor$ before $mr_harris$ appeared
her apprehensions once raised paid by their excess for all her former security and the servant who sat up with her for she would not allow $mrs_jennings$ to be called only tortured her more by hints of what her mistress had always thought
$marianne_dashwood$ ideas were still at intervals fixed incoherently on her #mother# and whenever she mentioned her name it gave a pang to the heart of poor $elinor$ who reproaching herself for having trifled with so many #day# of illness and wretched for some immediate relief fancied that all relief might soon be in vain that every #thing# had been delayed too long and pictured to herself her suffering #mother# arriving too late to see this darling child or to see her rational
she was on the point of sending again for $mr_harris$ or if he could not come for some other advice when the former but not till after five clock arrived
his opinion however made some little amends for his delay for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient he would not allow the danger to be material and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure with a confidence which in a lesser degree was communicated to $elinor$
he promised to call again in the course of three or four hours and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them
with strong concern and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid did $mrs_jennings$ hear in the morning of what had passed
her former apprehensions now with greater reason restored left her no doubt of the event and though trying to speak comfort to $elinor$ her conviction of her #sister# danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope
not a moment was lost in delay of any kind it was a night of almost equal suffering to both her heart was really grieved
the rapid decay the early death of a girl so young so lovely as $marianne_dashwood$ must have struck a less interested person with concern
she had been for three #month# her companion was still under her care and she was known to have been greatly injured and long unhappy
the distress of her #sister# too particularly a favourite was before her and as for their #mother# when $mrs_jennings$ considered that $marianne_dashwood$ might probably be to her what charlotte was to herself her sympathy in her sufferings was very sincere
$mr_harris$ was punctual in his second visit but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce
on $mrs_jennings$ compassion she had other claims his medicines had failed the fever was unabated and $marianne_dashwood$ only more quiet not more herself remained in a heavy stupor
but he judged it unnecessary he had still something more to try some more fresh application of whose success he was as confident as the last and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear but could not enter the heart of miss $marianne_dashwood$
she was calm except when she thought of her #mother# but she was almost hopeless and in this state she continued till noon scarcely stirring from her #sister# bed her thoughts wandering from one image of grief one suffering friend to another and
her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of $mrs_jennings$ who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which $marianne_dashwood$ disappointment had brought on
$elinor$ catching all and more than all his fears in a moment proposed to call in further advice $elinor$ felt all the reasonableness of the idea and it gave fresh misery to her reflections
about noon however she began but with a caution a dread of disappointment which for some #time# kept her silent even to her friend to fancy to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her #sister# pulse she waited watched and examined it again and again and at last with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness than all her foregoing distress ventured to communicate her hopes
$mrs_jennings$ though forced on examination to acknowledge a temporary revival tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance and $elinor$ conning over every injunction of distrust told herself likewise not to hope
hope had already entered and feeling all its anxious flutter she bent over her #sister# to watch she hardly knew for what
but it was too late #half# an hour passed away and the favourable symptom yet blessed her others even arose to confirm it
her breath her skin her lips all flattered $elinor$ with signs of amendment and $marianne_dashwood$ fixed her eyes on her with a rational though languid gaze
anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of $mr_harris$ at four clock when his assurances his felicitations on a recovery in her #sister# even surpassing his expectation gave her confidence comfort and tears of joy
$mrs_jennings$ perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm allowed herself to trust in his judgment and admitted with unfeigned joy and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness the probability of an entire recovery
$marianne_dashwood$ was in every respect materially better and he declared her entirely out of danger $elinor$ could not be cheerful her joy was of a different kind and led to any #thing# rather than to gaiety
$marianne_dashwood$ restored to life health friends and to her doting #mother# was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort and expand it in fervent
gratitude but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy no words no smiles all within $elinor$ breast was satisfaction silent and strong
she continued by the side of her #sister# with little intermission the whole afternoon calming every fear satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits supplying every succour and watching almost every look and every breath
the possibility of a relapse would of course in some moments occur to remind her of what anxiety was but when she saw on her frequent and minute examination that every symptom of recovery continued and saw $marianne_dashwood$ at six clock sink into a quiet steady and to all appearance comfortable sleep she silenced every doubt
at ten clock she trusted or at least not much later her #mother# would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be travelling towards them
the colonel too perhaps scarcely less an object of pity oh how slow was the progress of #time# which yet kept them in ignorance
the #time# was now drawing on when colonel $mrs_brandon$ might be expected back at seven clock leaving $marianne_dashwood$ still sweetly asleep she joined $mrs_jennings$ in the drawing room to tea
of breakfast she had been kept by her fears and of dinner by their sudden reverse from eating much and the present refreshment therefore with such feelings of content as she brought to it was particularly welcome
$mrs_jennings$ would have persuaded her at its conclusion to take some rest before her #mother# arrival and allow her to take her place by $marianne_dashwood$ but $elinor$ had no #sense# of fatigue no capability of sleep at that moment about her and she was not to be kept away from her #sister# an unnecessary instant
$mrs_jennings$ therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber to satisfy herself that all continued right left her there again to her charge and her thoughts and retired to her own room to write #letter# and sleep
the wind roared round the #house# and the rain beat against the windows but $elinor$ all happiness within regarded it not
the night was cold and stormy $marianne_dashwood$ slept through every blast and the travellers they had a rich reward in store for every present inconvenience
had it been ten $elinor$ would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the #house# and so strong was the persuasion that she did in spite of the almost impossibility of their being already come that she moved into the adjoining dressing closet and opened a window shutter to be satisfied of the truth
the clock struck eight she instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her the flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view
by their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn by four horses and this while it told the excess of her poor #mother# alarm gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity
the #knowledge# of what her #mother# must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door of her doubt her dread perhaps her despair and of what she had to tell with such #knowledge# it was impossible to be calm
all that remained to be done was to be speedy and therefore staying only till she could leave $mrs_jennings$ maid with her #sister# she hurried down stairs
the bustle in the vestibule as she passed along an inner lobby assured her that they were already in the #house#
never in her life had $elinor$ found it so difficult to be calm as at that moment she rushed to the drawing room she entered it and saw only $mrs_willoughby$
chapter $elinor$ starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room and her hand was already on the lock when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing and saying in a voice rather of command than supplication miss $marianne_dashwood$ for #half# an hour for ten minutes
i entreat you to stay no sir she replied with firmness i shall not stay your business cannot be with me
had they told me he cried with vehemence that mr $mrs_palmer$ and all his relations were at the devil it would not have turned me from the door
the servants i suppose forgot to tell you that mr $mrs_palmer$ was not in the #house# my business is with you and only you
with me in the utmost amazement well sir be quick and if you can less violent sit down and i #will# be both she hesitated she knew not what to do
the possibility of colonel $mrs_brandon$ arriving and finding her there came across her but she had promised to hear him and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged
after a moment recollection therefore concluding that prudence required dispatch and that her acquiescence would best promote it she walked silently towards the table and sat down
he took the opposite chair and for #half# a minute not a word was said by either pray be quick sir said $elinor$ impatiently i have no #time# to spare
he was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation and seemed not to hear her your #sister# said he with abruptness a moment afterwards is out of danger
i heard it from the servant god be praised but is it true is it really true $elinor$ would not speak
he repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness for god #sake# tell me is she out of danger or is she not
we hope she is he rose up and walked across the room had i known as much #half# an hour ago
but since i am here speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat what does it signify for once miss $marianne_dashwood$ it #will# be the last #time# perhaps let us be cheerful
together i am in a fine mood for gaiety tell me honestly a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks do you think me most a knave or a fool
she began to think that he must be in liquor the strangeness of such a visit and of such manners seemed no otherwise intelligible and with this impression she immediately rose saying mr $mrs_willoughby$ i advise you at present to return to $combe_magna$ i am not at leisure to remain with you
$elinor$ looked at him with greater astonishment than ever longer whatever your business may be with me it #will# be better recollected and explained to morrow
i understand you he replied with an expressive smile and a voice perfectly calm yes i am very drunk a pint of porter with my cold beef at marlborough was enough to over set me
yes i left london this morning at eight clock and the only ten minutes i have spent out of my chaise since that #time# procured me a nuncheon at marlborough
the steadiness of his manner and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke convincing $elinor$ that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to cleveland he was not brought there by intoxication she said after a moment recollection mr $mrs_willoughby$ you ought to feel and i certainly do that after what has passed your coming here in this manner and forcing yourself upon my notice requires a very particular excuse what is it that you mean by it
at marlborough cried $elinor$ more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at i mean said he with serious
i mean to offer some kind of explanation some kind of apology for the past to open my whole heart to you and by convincing you that though i have been always a blockhead i have not been always a rascal to obtain something like forgiveness from ma from your #sister#
energy if i can to make you hate me one degree less than you do now is this the real reason of your coming
upon my soul it is was his answer with a warmth which brought all the former $mrs_willoughby$ to her remembrance and in spite of herself made her think him sincere
if that is all you may be satisfied already for $marianne_dashwood$ does she has long forgiven you has she he cried in the same eager tone
then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it but she shall forgive me again and on more reasonable grounds now #will# you listen to me
$elinor$ bowed her assent i do not know said he after a pause of expectation on her side and thoughtfulness on his own how
you may have accounted for my behaviour to your #sister# or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me perhaps you #will# hardly think the better of me it is worth the trial however and you shall hear every #thing#
when i first became intimate in your family i had no other intention no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my #time# pleasantly while i was obliged to remain in devonshire more pleasantly than i had ever done before
your #sister# lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me and her behaviour to me almost from the first was of a kind
it is astonishing when i reflect on what it was and what she was that my heart should have been so insensible
careless of her happiness thinking only of my own amusement giving way to feelings which i had always been too much in the habit of indulging
i endeavoured by every means in my power to make myself pleasing to her without any design of returning her affection
miss $marianne_dashwood$ at this point turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt stopped him by saying it is hardly worth while mr $mrs_willoughby$ for you to relate or for me to listen any longer
such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any #thing# do not let me be pained by hearing any #thing# more on the #subject#
i insist on you hearing the whole of it he replied my #fortune# was never large and i had always been expensive always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself
every year since my coming of age or even before i believe had added to my debts and though the death of my old cousin $mrs_smith$ was to set me free yet that event being uncertain and possibly far distant it had been for some #time# my intention to re establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of #fortune#
to attach myself to your #sister# therefore was not a #thing# to be thought of and with a meanness selfishness cruelty which no indignant no contemptuous look even of yours miss $marianne_dashwood$ can ever reprobate too much i was acting in this manner trying to engage her regard without a thought of returning it but one #thing# may be said for me even in that horrid state of selfish vanity i did not know the extent of the injury i meditated because i did not then know what it was to love
but have i ever known it well may it be doubted for had i really loved could i have sacrificed my feelings to vanity to avarice or what is more could i have sacrificed hers
to avoid a comparative poverty which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors i have by raising myself to affluence lost every #thing# that could make it a blessing
but at first i must confess my vanity only was elevated by it but i have done it you did then said $elinor$ a little softened believe yourself at one #time# attached to her
to have resisted such attractions to have withstood such tenderness is there a #man# on earth who could have done it yes
i found myself by insensible degrees sincerely fond of her and the happiest hours of my life were what i spent with her when i felt my intentions were strictly honourable and my feelings blameless
even then however when fully determined on paying my addresses to her i allowed myself most improperly to put off from #day# to #day# the moment of doing it from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed
i #will# not reason here nor #will# i stop for you to expatiate on the absurdity and the worse than absurdity of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound
the event has proved that i was a cunning fool providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever
at last however my resolution was taken and i had determined as soon as i could engage her alone to justify the attentions i had so invariably paid her and openly assure her of an affection which i had already taken such pains to display
but in the interim in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass before i could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private a circumstance occurred an unlucky circumstance to ruin all my resolution and with it all my comfort
$mrs_smith$ had somehow or other been informed i imagine by some distant relation whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour of an affair a connection but i need not explain myself farther he added looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye your particular intimacy you have probably heard the whole story long ago
i have returned $elinor$ colouring likewise and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him i have heard it all
and how you #will# explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business i confess is beyond my comprehension
a discovery took place here he hesitated and looked down mrs remember cried $mrs_willoughby$ from whom you received the account could it be an impartial one
i do not mean to justify myself but at the same #time# cannot leave you to suppose that i have #nothing# to urge that because she was injured she was irreproachable and because i was a libertine she must be a saint
i acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me if the violence of her passions the weakness of her understanding i do not mean however to defend myself
her affection for me deserved better treatment and i often with great self reproach recall the tenderness which for a very short #time# had the power of creating any return
but i have injured more than herself and i have injured one whose affection for me may i say it was scarcely less warm than hers and whose mind oh how infinitely superior
i #wish# i heartily #wish# it had never been your indifference however towards that unfortunate girl i must say it unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a #subject#
do not think yourself excused by any weakness any natural defect of understanding on her side in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours
you must have known that while you were enjoying yourself in devonshire pursuing fresh schemes always gay always happy she was reduced to the extremest indigence
but upon my soul i did not know it he warmly replied i did not recollect that i had omitted to give her my direction and common #sense# might have told her how to find it out
may well be your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her well sir and what said $mrs_smith$
she taxed me with the offence at once and my confusion may be guessed the purity of her life the formality of her notions her ignorance of the world every #thing# was against me
she was previously disposed i believe to doubt the morality of my conduct in general and was moreover discontented with the very little attention the very little portion of my #time# that i had bestowed on her in my present visit
the matter itself i could not deny and vain was every endeavour to soften it in short it ended in a total breach
by one measure i might have saved myself in the height of her morality good woman she offered to forgive the past if i would marry eliza
the night following this affair i was to go the next morning was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be
that could not be and i was formally dismissed from her favour and her #house# the struggle was great but it ended too soon
my affection for $marianne_dashwood$ my thorough conviction of her #attachment# to me it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches which i was naturally inclined to feel and expensive society had increased
i had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife if i chose to address her and i persuaded myself to think that #nothing# else in common prudence remained for me to do
a heavy scene however awaited me before i could leave devonshire i was engaged to dine with you on that very #day# some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement
to see $marianne_dashwood$ i felt would be dreadful and i even doubted whether i could see her again and keep to my resolution
in that point however i undervalued my own magnanimity as the event declared for i went i saw her and saw her miserable and left her miserable and left her hoping never to see her again
but whether i should write this apology or deliver it in person was a point of long debate why did you call mr $mrs_willoughby$ said $elinor$ reproachfully a note would have answered every purpose
i could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you or the rest of the neighbourhood to suspect any part of what had really passed between $mrs_smith$ and myself and i resolved therefore on calling at the cottage in my way to honiton
why was it necessary to call it was necessary to my own pride the sight of your dear #sister# however was really dreadful and to heighten the matter i found her alone
you were all gone i do not know where i had left her only the evening before so fully so firmly resolved within my self on doing right
a few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever and i remember how happy how gay were my spirits as i walked from the cottage to allenham satisfied with myself delighted with every body
but in this our last interview of friendship i approached her with a #sense# of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling
her #sorrow# her disappointment her deep regret when i told her that i was obliged to leave devonshire so immediately i never shall forget it united too with such reliance such confidence in me oh god what a hard hearted rascal i was
they were both silent for a few moments $elinor$ first spoke did you tell her that you should soon return
i do not know what i told her he replied impatiently less than was due to the past beyond a doubt and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future
i cannot think of it it wont do then came your dear #mother# to torture me farther with all her kindness and confidence
thank heaven it did torture me i was miserable miss $marianne_dashwood$ you cannot have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery
i owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid rascally folly of my own heart that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now
my journey to town travelling with my own horses and therefore so tediously no creature to speak to my own reflections so cheerful when i looked forward every #thing#
well i went left all that i loved and went to those to whom at best i was only indifferent so inviting when
i looked back at $barton$ the picture so soothing oh it was a blessed journey he stopped well sir said $elinor$ who though pitying him grew impatient for his departure and this is all
ah no have you forgot what passed in town that infamous #letter# did she shew it you yes i saw every note that passed
when the first of hers reached me as it immediately did for i was in town the whole #time# what i felt is in the common phrase not to be expressed in a more simple one perhaps too simple to raise any emotion my feelings were very very painful every line every word was in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer were she here would forbid a dagger to my heart
to know that $marianne_dashwood$ was in town was in the same language a thunderbolt thunderbolts and daggers what a reproof would she have given me her taste her opinions
i believe they are better known to me than my own and i am sure they are dearer $elinor$ heart which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation was now softened again yet
she felt it her #duty# to check such ideas in her companion as the last this is not right mr $mrs_willoughby$ remember that you are married
$marianne_dashwood$ note by assuring me that i was still as dear to her as in former #day# that in spite of the many many weeks we had been separated she was as constant in her own feelings and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever awakened all my remorse
i say awakened because #time# and london business and dissipation had in some measure quieted it and i had been growing a fine hardened villain fancying myself indifferent to her and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me talking to myself of our past #attachment# as a mere idle trifling business shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so and silencing every reproach overcoming every scruple by secretly saying now and then i shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married
relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear but this note made me know myself better
i felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world and that i was using her infamously
but every #thing# was then just settled between miss grey and me to retreat was impossible all that i had to do was to avoid you both
i sent no answer to $marianne_dashwood$ intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice and for some #time# i was even determined not to call in berkeley
judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool common acquaintance than anything else i watched you all safely out of the #house# one morning and left my name
street but at last watched us out of the #house# even so you would be surprised to hear how often i watched you
how often i was on the point of falling in with you i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight as the carriage drove by
lodging as i did in bond street there was hardly a #day# in which i did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you and #nothing# but the most constant watchfulness on my side a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight could have separated us so long
i avoided the $middletons$ as much as possible as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common
not aware of their being in town however i blundered on sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ i believe the first #day# of his coming and the #day# after i had called at $mrs_jennings$
he asked me to a party a dance at his #house# in the evening had he not told me as an inducement that you and your #sister# were to be there i should have felt it too certain a #thing# to trust myself near him
the next morning brought another short note from $marianne_dashwood$ still affectionate open artless confiding everything that could make my conduct most hateful i could not answer it
i tried but could not frame a sentence but i thought of her i believe every moment of the #day# if you can pity me miss $marianne_dashwood$ pity my situation as it was then
with my head and heart full of your #sister# i was forced to play the happy lover to another woman those three or four weeks were worse than all
well at last as i need not tell you you were forced on me and what a sweet figure i cut what an evening of agony
it was $marianne_dashwood$ beautiful as an angel on one side calling me $mrs_willoughby$ in such a tone oh god holding out her hand to me asking me for an explanation with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face and sophia jealous as the devil on the other hand looking all that was
such an evening i ran away from you all as soon as i could but not before i had seen $marianne_dashwood$ sweet face as white as death that was the last last look i ever had of her the last manner in which she appeared to me
when i thought of her to #day# as really dying it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that i knew exactly how she would appear to those who saw her last in this world
well it does not signify it is over now it was a horrid sight yet she was before me constantly before me as i travelled in the same look and hue
a short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded $mrs_willoughby$ first rousing himself broke it thus well let me make haste and be gone
your #sister# is certainly better certainly out of danger we are assured of it your poor #mother# too doting on $marianne_dashwood$
but the #letter# mr $mrs_willoughby$ your own #letter# have you any #thing# to say about that yes yes that in particular
your #sister# wrote to me again you know the very next morning you saw what she said i was breakfasting at the ellisons and her #letter# with some others was brought to me there from my lodgings
it happened to catch sophia eye before it caught mine and its size the elegance of the paper the hand writing altogether immediately gave her a suspicion
some vague report had reached her before of my #attachment# to some young #lady# in devonshire and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young #lady# was and made her more jealous than ever
affecting that air of playfulness therefore which is delightful in a woman one loves she opened the #letter# directly and read its contents
she was well paid for her impudence she read what made her wretched her wretchedness i could have borne but her passion her malice
at all events it must be appeased and in short what do you think of my wife style of #letter# writing delicate tender truly feminine was it not
yes but i had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as i was ashamed to put my name to
your wife the #letter# was in your own hand writing the original was all her own her own happy thoughts and gentle diction
but what could i do we were engaged every #thing# in preparation the #day# almost fixed but i am talking like a fool
her money was necessary to me and in a situation like mine any #thing# was to be done to prevent a rupture
and after all what did it signify to my character in the opinion of $marianne_dashwood$ and her friends in what language my answer was couched it must have been only to one end
my business was to declare myself a scoundrel and whether i did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance
i to myself i am shut out for ever from their society they already think me an unprincipled fellow this #letter# #will# only make them think me a blackguard one
such were my reasonings as in a sort of desperate carelessness i copied my wife words and parted with the last relics of $marianne_dashwood$
her three notes unluckily they were all in my pocketbook or i should have denied their existence and hoarded them for ever i was forced to put them up and could not even kiss them
and the lock of hair that too i had always carried about me in the same pocket book which was now searched by madam with the most ingratiating virulence the dear lock all every memento was torn from me
you are very wrong mr $mrs_willoughby$ very blamable said $elinor$ while her voice in spite of herself betrayed her compassionate emotion you ought not to speak in this way either of $mrs_willoughby$ or my #sister#
preparation #day# in honest words i am ruined for ever in their opinion said you had made your own choice it was not forced on you
your wife has a claim to your politeness to your respect at least she must be attached to you or she would not have married you
to treat her with unkindness to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to $marianne_dashwood$ nor can i suppose it a relief to your own conscience
she does not deserve your compassion she knew i had no regard for her when we married well married we were and came down to $combe_magna$ to be happy and afterwards returned to town to be
do not talk to me of my wife said he with a heavy sigh gay and now do you pity me
miss $marianne_dashwood$ or have i said all this to no purpose am i be it only one degree am i less guilty in your opinion than i was before my
intentions were not always wrong have i explained away any part of my guilt yes you have certainly removed something a little
you have proved yourself on the whole less faulty than i had believed you you have proved your heart less wicked much less wicked
but i hardly know the misery that you have inflicted i hardly know what could have made it worse #will# you repeat to your #sister# when she is recovered what i have been telling you let
me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours you tell me that she has forgiven me already
let me be able to fancy that a better #knowledge# of my heart and of my present feelings #will# draw from her a more spontaneous more natural more gentle less dignified forgiveness
tell her of my misery and my penitence tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her and if you #will# that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever
but you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now nor how you heard of her illness
last night in drury lane lobby i ran against sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ $lady_middleton$ and when he saw who i was for the first #time# these two #month# he spoke to me that
i #will# tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called your justification he had cut me ever since my marriage
now however his good natured honest stupid soul full of indignation against me and concern for your #sister# could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to though probably he did not think it would
as bluntly as he could speak it therefore he told me that $marianne_dashwood$ was dying of a putrid fever at cleveland a #letter# that morning received from $mrs_jennings$
declared her danger most imminent the palmers are all gone off in a fright i was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning sir $mrs_john_dashwood$
his heart was softened in seeing mine suffer and so much of his ill #will# was done away that when we parted he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy
what i felt on hearing that your #sister# was dying and dying too believing me the greatest villain upon earth scorning hating me in her latest moments for how could i tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed
i had seen without surprise or resentment vex me horridly one person i was sure would represent me as capable of any #thing#
what i felt was dreadful my resolution was soon made and at eight clock this morning i was in my carriage now you know all
her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness dissipation and luxury had made in the mind the character the happiness of a #man# who to every advantage of person and talents united a disposition naturally open and honest and a feeling affectionate temper
$elinor$ made no answer the world had made him extravagant and vain extravagance and vanity had made him cold hearted and selfish
vanity while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another had involved him in a real #attachment# which extravagance or at least its offspring necessity had required to be sacrificed
the #attachment# from which against honour against feeling against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself now when no longer allowable governed every thought and the connection for the #sake# of which he had with little scruple left her #sister# to misery was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature
from a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by $mrs_willoughby$ who rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful started up in preparation for going and said
each faulty propensity in leading him to evil had led him likewise to punishment there is no use in staying here i must be off
are you going back to town no to $combe_magna$ i have business there from thence to town in a #day# or two
good bye he held out his hand she could not refuse to give him hers he pressed it with affection
and you do think something better of me than you did said he letting it fall and leaning against the mantel piece as if forgetting he was to go
$elinor$ assured him that she did that she forgave pitied wished him well was even interested in his happiness and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it
his answer was not very encouraging as to that said he i must rub through the world as well as i can
if however i am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions it may be the means it may put me on my guard at least it may be something to live for
domestic happiness is out of the question $marianne_dashwood$ to be sure is lost to me for ever were i even by any blessed chance at
liberty again $elinor$ stopped him with a reproof well he replied once more good bye i shall now go away and live in dread of one event
what do you mean your #sister# marriage you are very wrong she can never be more lost to you than she is now
and if that some one should be the very he whom of all others i could least bear but i #will# not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill by shewing that where i have most injured i can least forgive
but she #will# be gained by some one else good bye god bless you and with these words he almost ran out of the room
chapter $elinor$ for some #time# after he left her for some #time# even after the sound of his carriage had died away remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas widely differing in themselves but of which sadness was the general result to think even of her #sister#
$mrs_willoughby$ he whom only #half# an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of #man# $mrs_willoughby$ in spite of all his faults excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family with a tenderness a regret rather in proportion as she soon acknowledged within herself to his #wish# than to his merits
she felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight by that person of uncommon attraction that open affectionate and lively manner which it was no merit to possess and by that still ardent love for $marianne_dashwood$ which it was not even innocent to indulge
when at last she returned to the unconscious $marianne_dashwood$ she found her just awaking refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes
the past the present the future $mrs_willoughby$ visit $marianne_dashwood$ safety and her #mother# expected arrival threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her #sister#
short was the #time# however in which that fear could affect her for within #half# an hour after $mrs_willoughby$ leaving the #house# she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage eager to save her #mother# from every unnecessary moment horrible suspense she ran immediately into the hall and reached the outward door just in #time# to receive and support her as she entered it
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ whose terror as they drew near the #house# had produced almost the conviction of $marianne_dashwood$ being no more had no voice to inquire after her no voice even for $elinor$ but she waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry instantly gave the joyful relief and her #mother# catching it with all her usual warmth was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness as she had been before by her fears
she was supported into the drawing room between her daughter and her friend and there shedding tears of joy though still unable to speak embraced $elinor$ again and again turning from her at intervals to press colonel $mrs_brandon$ hand with a look which spoke at once her gratitude and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment
but she felt that it was so long long before she could feel his influence less $elinor$ heart was full he shared it however in a silence even greater than her own
as soon as mrs $marianne_dashwood$ had recovered herself to see $marianne_dashwood$ was her first desire and in two minutes she was with her beloved child rendered dearer to her than ever by absence unhappiness and danger
$elinor$ delight as she saw what each felt in the meeting was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing $marianne_dashwood$ of farther sleep but
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ could be calm could be even prudent when the life of a child was at stake and $marianne_dashwood$ satisfied in knowing her #mother# was near her and conscious of being too weak for conversation submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her
but the rest which one night entirely sleepless and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite was kept off by irritation of spirits
$mrs_willoughby$ poor $mrs_willoughby$ as she now allowed herself to call him was constantly in her thoughts she would not but have heard his vindication for the world and now blamed now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ would sit up with her all night and $elinor$ in compliance with her #mother# entreaty went to bed but her promise of relating it to her #sister# was invariably painful
she dreaded the performance of it dreaded what its effect on $marianne_dashwood$ might be doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another and for a moment wished $mrs_willoughby$ a widower
then remembering colonel $mrs_brandon$ reproved herself felt that to his sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival the reward of her #sister# was due and wished any #thing# rather than $mrs_willoughby$ death
the shock of colonel $mrs_brandon$ errand at $barton$ had been much softened to mrs $marianne_dashwood$ by her own previous alarm for so great was her uneasiness about $marianne_dashwood$ that she had already determined to set out for cleveland on that very #day# without waiting for any further intelligence and had so far settled her journey before his arrival that the careys were then expected every moment to fetch $margaret$ away as her #mother# was unwilling to take her where there might be infection
$marianne_dashwood$ continued to mend every #day# and the brilliant cheerfulness of mrs $marianne_dashwood$ looks and spirits proved her to be as she repeatedly declared herself one of the happiest women in the world
but mrs $marianne_dashwood$ trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which $elinor$ had sent her was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it
$marianne_dashwood$ was restored to her from a danger in which as she now began to feel her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate #attachment# to $mrs_willoughby$ had contributed to place her and in her recovery
$elinor$ could not hear the declaration nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her #mother# ever recollected $mr_edward_ferrars$ she had yet another source of joy unthought of by $elinor$
it was thus imparted to her as soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred at last we are alone
my $elinor$ you do not yet know all my happiness colonel $mrs_brandon$ loves $marianne_dashwood$ he has told me so himself
her daughter feeling by turns both pleased and pained surprised and not surprised was all silent attention you are never like me dear $elinor$ or i should wonder at your composure now
had i sat down to #wish# for any possible good to my family i should have fixed on colonel $mrs_brandon$ marrying one of you as the object most desirable
$elinor$ was #half# inclined to ask her reason for thinking so because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age characters or feelings could be given but her #mother# must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting #subject# and therefore instead of an inquiry she passed it off with a smile
and i believe $marianne_dashwood$ #will# be the most happy with him of the two he opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled
i you may well believe could talk of #nothing# but my child he could not conceal his distress i saw that it equalled my own and he perhaps thinking that mere friendship as the world now goes would not justify so warm a sympathy or rather not thinking at all i suppose giving way to irresistible feelings made me acquainted with his earnest tender constant affection for $marianne_dashwood$
it came out quite unawares quite undesignedly he has loved her my $elinor$ ever since the first moment of seeing her
here however $elinor$ perceived not the language not the professions of colonel $mrs_brandon$ but the natural embellishments of her #mother# active fancy which fashioned every #thing# delightful to her as it chose
his regard for her infinitely surpassing anything that $mrs_willoughby$ ever felt or feigned as much more warm as more sincere or constant which ever we are to call it has subsisted through all the #knowledge# of dear $marianne_dashwood$ unhappy prepossession for that worthless young #man# and without selfishness without encouraging a hope could he have seen her happy with another such a noble mind such openness such sincerity no one can be deceived in him
i know it is replied her #mother# seriously or after such a warning i should be the last to encourage such affection or even to be pleased by it
but his coming for me as he did with such active such ready friendship is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of #man#
his character however answered $elinor$ does not rest on one act of kindness to which his affection for $marianne_dashwood$ were humanity out of the case would have prompted him
to $mrs_jennings$ to the $middletons$ he has been long and intimately known they equally love and respect him and even my own #knowledge# of him though lately acquired is very considerable and so highly do i value and esteem him that if $marianne_dashwood$ can be happy with him i shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world
colonel $mrs_brandon$ character said $elinor$ as an excellent #man# is well established what answer did you give him did
you allow him to hope oh my love i could not then talk of hope to him or to myself
$marianne_dashwood$ might at that moment be dying but he did not ask for hope or encouragement his was an involuntary confidence an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend not an application to a parent
yet after a #time# i did say for at first i was quite overcome that if she lived as i trusted she might my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage and since our arrival since our delightful security i have repeated it to him more fully have given him every encouragement in my power
#time# a very little #time# i tell him #will# do everything $marianne_dashwood$ heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a #man# as $mrs_willoughby$
his own merits must soon secure it to judge from the colonel spirits however you have not yet made him equally sanguine
no he thinks $marianne_dashwood$ affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of #time# and even supposing her heart again free is too diffident of himself to believe that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her
his age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and principles fixed and his disposition i am well convinced is exactly the very one to make your #sister# happy
my partiality does not blind me he certainly is not so handsome as $mrs_willoughby$ but at the same #time# there is something much more pleasing in his countenance
there however he is quite mistaken and his person his manners too are all in his favour there was always a something if you remember in $mrs_willoughby$ eyes at #time# which i did not like
$elinor$ could not remember it but her #mother# without waiting for her assent continued and his manners the colonel manners are not only more pleasing to me than $mrs_willoughby$ ever were but they are of a kind
their gentleness their genuine attention to other people and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition than the liveliness often artificial and often ill timed of the other
i am very sure myself that had $mrs_willoughby$ turned out as really amiable as he has proved himself the contrary $marianne_dashwood$ would yet never have been so happy with him as she #will# be with colonel $mrs_brandon$
i well know to be more solidly attaching to $marianne_dashwood$ she paused her daughter could not quite agree with her but her dissent was not heard and therefore gave no offence
at delaford she #will# be within an easy distance of me added mrs $marianne_dashwood$ even if i remain at $barton$ and in all probability for i hear it is a large
village indeed there certainly must be some small #house# or cottage close by that would suit us quite as well as our present situation
his #fortune# too for at my #time# of life you know everybody cares about that and though i neither know nor desire to know what it really is i am sure it must be a good one
here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person and $elinor$ withdrew to think it all over in private to #wish# success to her friend and yet in wishing it to feel a pang for $mrs_willoughby$
poor $elinor$ here was a new scheme for getting her to delaford but her spirit was stubborn chapter
$marianne_dashwood$ illness though weakening in its kind had not been long enough to make her recovery slow and with youth natural strength and her #mother# presence in aid it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove within four #day# after the arrival of the latter into $mrs_palmer$ dressing room
when there at her own particular request for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her #mother# colonel $mrs_brandon$ was invited to visit her
his emotion on entering the room in seeing her altered looks and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him was such as in $elinor$ conjecture must arise from something more than his affection for $marianne_dashwood$ or the consciousness of its being known to others and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her #sister# the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind brought back by that resemblance between $marianne_dashwood$ and eliza already acknowledged and now strengthened by the hollow eye the sickly skin the posture of reclining weakness and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ not less watchful of what passed than her daughter but with a mind very differently influenced and therefore watching to very different effect saw #nothing# in the colonel behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self evident sensations while in the actions and words of $marianne_dashwood$ she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned
at the end of another #day# or two $marianne_dashwood$ growing visibly stronger every twelve hours mrs $marianne_dashwood$ urged equally by her own and her daughter #wish# began to talk of removing to $barton$
on her measures depended those of her two friends $mrs_jennings$ could not quit cleveland during the dashwoods stay and colonel $mrs_brandon$ was soon brought by their united request to consider his own abode there as equally determinate if not equally indispensable
at his and $mrs_jennings$ united request in return mrs $marianne_dashwood$ was prevailed on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back for the better accommodation of her sick child and the colonel at the joint invitation of mrs $marianne_dashwood$ and $mrs_jennings$ whose active good nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage in the course of a few weeks
the #day# of separation and departure arrived and $marianne_dashwood$ after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of $mrs_jennings$ one so earnestly grateful so full of respect and kind #wish# as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention and bidding colonel $mrs_brandon$ farewell with a cordiality of a friend was carefully assisted by him into the carriage of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least #half#
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ and $elinor$ then followed and the others were left by themselves to talk of the travellers and feel their own dullness till $mrs_jennings$ was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young companions and colonel $mrs_brandon$ immediately afterwards took his solitary way to delaford
every #thing# that the most zealous affection the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable was the office of each watchful companion and each found their reward in her bodily ease and her calmness of spirits
the dashwoods were two #day# on the road and $marianne_dashwood$ bore her journey on both without essential fatigue to $elinor$ the observation of the latter was particularly grateful
she who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering oppressed by anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of nor fortitude to conceal now saw with a joy which no other could equally share an apparent composure of mind which in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness
as they approached $barton$ indeed and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar some painful recollection she grew silent and thoughtful and turning away her face from their notice sat earnestly gazing through the window
but here $elinor$ could neither wonder nor blame and when she saw as she assisted $marianne_dashwood$ from the carriage that she had been crying she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any #thing# less tender than pity and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise
in the whole of her subsequent manner she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion for no sooner had they entered their common sitting room than $marianne_dashwood$ turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of every object
with which the remembrance of $mrs_willoughby$ could be connected she said little but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness and though a sigh sometimes escaped her it never passed away without the atonement of a smile
she went to it but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera procured for her by $mrs_willoughby$ containing some of their favourite duets and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his hand writing that would not do she shook her head put the music aside and after running over the keys for a minute complained of feebleness in her fingers and closed the instrument again declaring however with firmness as she did so that she should in future practice much
on the contrary with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit anticipating the pleasure of $margaret$ return and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society as the only happiness worth a #wish#
when the weather is settled and i have recovered my strength said she we #will# take long walks together every #day#
we #will# walk to the farm at the edge of the down and see how the children go on we #will# walk to sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ new plantations at $barton$ cross and the abbeyland and we #will# often go to the old ruins of the priory and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached
after dinner she would try her piano forte the next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms i know we shall be happy
i mean never to be later in rising than six and from that #time# till dinner i shall divide every moment between music and reading
i know the summer #will# pass happily away i have formed my plan and am determined to enter on a course of serious study
but there are many works well worth reading at the park and there are others of more modern production which i know i can borrow of colonel $mrs_brandon$
by reading only six hours a #day# i shall gain in the course of a twelve #month# a great deal of instruction which i now feel myself to want
$elinor$ honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self control
her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to $mrs_willoughby$ was yet unfulfilled and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of $marianne_dashwood$ and ruin at least for a #time# this fair prospect of busy tranquillity
willing therefore to delay the evil hour she resolved to wait till her #sister# health were more secure before she appointed it
our own library is too well known to me to be resorted to for any #thing# beyond mere amusement but the resolution was made only to be broken
$marianne_dashwood$ had been two or three #day# at home before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out
but at last a soft genial morning appeared such as might tempt the daughter #wish# and the #mother# confidence and $marianne_dashwood$ leaning on $elinor$ arm was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue in the lane before the #house#
the #sister# set out at a pace slow as the feebleness of $marianne_dashwood$ in an exercise hitherto untried since her illness
they had advanced only so far beyond the #house# as to admit a full view of the hill the important hill behind when pausing with her eyes turned towards it $marianne_dashwood$ calmly said there exactly there pointing with one hand on that projecting mound there i fell and there i first saw $mrs_willoughby$
her voice sunk with the word but presently reviving she added i am thankful to find that i can look with so little pain on the spot shall we ever talk on that #subject# $elinor$ hesitatingly it was said or #will# it be wrong i can talk of it now i hope as i ought to do $elinor$ tenderly invited her to be open
i do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him but what they are now at present if i could be satisfied on one point if i could be allowed to think that he was not always acting a part not always deceiving
me but above all if i could be assured that he never was so very wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him since the story of that unfortunate girl she stopt
$elinor$ joyfully treasured her words as she answered if you could be assured of that you think you should be easy
required and as for regret said $marianne_dashwood$ i have done with that as far as he is concerned
my peace of mind is doubly involved in it for not only is it horrible to suspect a person who has been what he has been to me of such designs but what must it make me appear to myself what in a situation like mine but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to
yes how then asked her #sister# would you account for his behaviour i would suppose him oh how gladly would i suppose him only fickle very very fickle
she was debating within herself on the eligibility of beginning her story directly or postponing it till $marianne_dashwood$ were in stronger health and they crept on for a few minutes in silence
i am not wishing him too much good said $marianne_dashwood$ at last with a sigh when i #wish# his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own
$elinor$ said no more he #will# suffer enough in them do you compare your conduct with his
no i compare it with what it ought to have been i compare it with yours our situations have borne little resemblance
they have borne more than our conduct do not my dearest $elinor$ let your kindness defend what i know your judgment must censure
my illness has made me think it has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection long before i was enough recovered to talk i was perfectly able to reflect
i considered the past i saw in my own behaviour since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn #nothing# but a series of imprudence towards myself and want of kindness to others
i saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave
my illness i well knew had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health as i had felt even at the #time# to be wrong
i did not know my danger till the danger was removed but with such feelings as these reflections gave me i wonder at my recovery wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live to have #time# for atonement to my god and to you all did not kill me at once
had i died in what peculiar misery should i have left you my nurse my friend my #sister# you who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter #day# who had known all the murmurings of my heart how
had i died it would have been self destruction should i have lived in your remembrance my #mother# too how could you have consoled her i cannot express my own abhorrence of myself
whenever i looked towards the past i saw some #duty# neglected or some failing indulged every body seemed injured by me
to the $middletons$ to the palmers the $miss_steeles$ to every common acquaintance even i had been insolent and unjust with a heart hardened against their merits and a temper irritated by their very attention to $mrs_john_dashwood$ to $fanny$ yes even to them little as they deserve i had given less than their due
the kindness the unceasing kindness of $mrs_jennings$ i had repaid with ungrateful contempt but you you above all above my #mother# had been wronged by me
i and only i knew your heart and its #sorrow# yet to what did it influence me not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself your example was before me but to what avail was i more considerate of you and your comfort
did i imitate your forbearance or lessen your restraints by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone no not less when i knew you to be unhappy than when i had believed you at ease did i turn away from every exertion of #duty# or friendship scarcely allowing #sorrow# to exist but with me regretting only that heart which had deserted and wronged me and leaving you for whom i professed an unbounded affection to be miserable for my #sake#
here ceased the rapid flow of her self reproving spirit and $elinor$ impatient to soothe though too honest to flatter gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved
i have laid down my plan and if i am capable of adhering to it my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved
$marianne_dashwood$ pressed her hand and replied you are very good the future must be my proof they shall no longer worry others nor torture myself
you my #mother# and $margaret$ must henceforth be all the world to me you #will# share my affections entirely between you
from you from my home i shall never again have the smallest incitement to move and if i do mix in other society it #will# be only to shew that my spirit is humbled my heart amended and that i can practise the civilities the lesser #duty# of life with gentleness and forbearance
i shall now live solely for my family as for $mrs_willoughby$ to say that i shall soon or that i shall ever forget him would be idle
his remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions but it shall be regulated it shall be checked by religion by reason by constant employment
$elinor$ who had now been for some #time# reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration without feeling at all nearer decision than at first heard this and perceiving that as reflection did #nothing# resolution must do all soon found herself leading to the fact
she managed the recital as she hoped with address prepared her anxious listener with caution related simply and honestly the chief points on which $mrs_willoughby$ grounded his apology did justice to his repentance and softened only his protestations of present regard
$marianne_dashwood$ said not a word she trembled her eyes were fixed on the ground and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them
she paused and added in a low voice if i could but know his heart everything would become easy a thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart but she dared not urge one
she caught every syllable with panting eagerness her hand unknowingly to herself closely pressed her #sister# and tears covered her cheeks
$elinor$ dreading her being tired led her towards home and till they reached the door of the cottage easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it talked of #nothing# but $mrs_willoughby$ and their conversation together and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look where minuteness could be safely indulged
as soon as they entered the #house# $marianne_dashwood$ with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears tell mama withdrew from her #sister# and walked slowly up stairs
$elinor$ would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought and with a mind anxiously pre arranging its result and a resolution of reviving the #subject# again should $marianne_dashwood$ fail to do it she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting injunction
chapter mrs $marianne_dashwood$ did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite she rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt she was sorry for him she wished him happy
but the feelings of the past could not be recalled #nothing# could restore him with a faith unbroken a character unblemished to $marianne_dashwood$
#nothing# could do away the #knowledge# of what the latter had suffered through his means nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards eliza
had mrs $marianne_dashwood$ like her daughter heard $mrs_willoughby$ story from himself had she witnessed his distress and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner it is probable that her compassion would have been greater
but it was neither in $elinor$ power nor in her #wish# to rouse such feelings in another by her retailed explanation as had at first been called forth in herself
reflection had given calmness to her judgment and sobered her own opinion of $mrs_willoughby$ deserts she wished therefore to declare only the simple truth and lay open such facts as were really due to his character without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray
in the evening when they were all three together $marianne_dashwood$ began voluntarily to speak of him again but that it was not without an effort
the restless unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some #time# previously sitting her rising colour as she spoke and her unsteady voice plainly shewed
#nothing# could replace him therefore in her former esteem nor injure the interests of colonel $mrs_brandon$ i #wish# to assure you both said she that i see every #thing# as you can desire me to do
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness had not $elinor$ who really wished to hear her #sister# unbiased opinion by an eager sign engaged her silence
it is a great relief to me what $elinor$ told me this morning i have now heard exactly what i wished to hear for some moments her voice was lost but recovering herself she added and with greater calmness than before i am now perfectly satisfied i #wish# for no change
i never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later i must have known all this i should have had no confidence no esteem
$marianne_dashwood$ slowly continued #nothing# could have done it away to my feelings i know it i know it cried her #mother#
happy with a #man# of libertine practices with one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends and the best of #man# no my $marianne_dashwood$ has not a heart to be made happy with such a #man# her conscience her sensitive conscience would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt
you consider the matter said $elinor$ exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it and i dare say you perceive as well as myself not only in this but in many other circumstances reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection on his side much less certain
his expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself and his whole conduct declares that self denial is a word hardly understood by him
his demands and your inexperience together on a small very small income must have brought on distresses which would not be the less grievous to you from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before
your #sense# of honour and honesty would have led you i know when aware of your situation to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible and perhaps as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort you might have been suffered to practice it but beyond that and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage beyond that had you endeavoured however reasonably to abridge his enjoyments is it not to be feared that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it you would have lessened your own influence on his heart and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties
$marianne_dashwood$ sighed and repeated i #wish# for no change had you married you must have been always poor
$marianne_dashwood$ lips quivered and she repeated the word selfish in a tone that implied do you really think him selfish
the whole of his behaviour replied $elinor$ from the beginning to the end of the affair has been grounded on selfishness
it was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections which afterwards when his own were engaged made him delay the confession of it and which finally carried him from $barton$
his own enjoyment or his own ease was in every particular his ruling principle it is very true my happiness never was his object
at present continued $elinor$ he regrets what he has done and why does he regret it because he finds it has not answered towards himself
his circumstances are now unembarrassed he suffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself
it has not made him happy but does it follow that had he married you he would have been happy the inconveniences would have been different
he would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint but he would have been always necessitous always poor and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance even to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a wife
he would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which because they are removed he now reckons as #nothing# i have not a doubt of it said $marianne_dashwood$ and i have #nothing# to regret #nothing# but my own folly
$marianne_dashwood$ would not let her proceed and $elinor$ satisfied that each felt their own error wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her #sister# spirits she therefore pursuing the first #subject# immediately continued one observation may i think be fairly drawn from the whole of the story that all $mrs_willoughby$ difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue in his behaviour to eliza williams
rather say your #mother# imprudence my child said mrs $marianne_dashwood$ she must be answerable that crime has been the origin of every lesser one and of all his present discontents
$marianne_dashwood$ assented most feelingly to the remark and her #mother# was led by it to an enumeration of colonel $mrs_brandon$ injuries and merits warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate
$elinor$ according to her expectation saw on the two or three following #day# that $marianne_dashwood$ did not continue to gain strength as she had done but while her resolution was unsubdued and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy her #sister# could safely trust to the effect of #time# upon her health
$margaret$ returned and the family were again all restored to each other again quietly settled at the cottage and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to $barton$ at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future
her daughter did not look however as if much of it were heard by her $elinor$ grew impatient for some tidings of $mr_edward_ferrars$
she had heard #nothing# of him since her leaving london #nothing# new of his plans #nothing# certain even of his present abode
some #letter# had passed between her and her brother in consequence of $marianne_dashwood$ illness and in the first of $mrs_john_dashwood$ there had been this sentence
we know #nothing# of our unfortunate $mr_edward_ferrars$ and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a #subject# but conclude him to be still at oxford which was all the intelligence of $mr_edward_ferrars$ afforded her by the correspondence for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding #letter#
their #man# servant had been sent one morning to exeter on business and when as he waited at table he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand this was his voluntary communication
she was not doomed however to be long in ignorance of his measures i suppose you know ma am that $mr_edward_ferrars$ is married
$marianne_dashwood$ gave a violent start fixed her eyes upon $elinor$ saw her turning pale and fell back in her chair in hysterics
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ whose eyes as she answered the servant inquiry had intuitively taken the same direction was shocked to perceive by $elinor$ countenance how much she really suffered and a moment afterwards alike distressed by $marianne_dashwood$ situation knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention
the servant who saw only that miss $marianne_dashwood$ was taken ill had #sense# enough to call one of the maids who with mrs $marianne_dashwood$ assistance supported her into the other room
by that #time# $marianne_dashwood$ was rather better and her #mother# leaving her to the care of $margaret$ and the maid returned to $elinor$ who though still much disordered had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of thomas as to the source of his intelligence
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ immediately took all that trouble on herself and $elinor$ had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it
who told you that $mr_edward_ferrars$ was married thomas i see $mr_edward_ferrars$ myself ma am this morning in exeter and his #lady# too $miss_lucy_steele$ as was
they was stopping in a chaise at the door of the new london inn as i went there with a message from sally at the park to her brother who is one of the post boys
i happened to look up as i went by the chaise and so i see directly it was the youngest $miss_lucy_steele$
so i took off my hat and she knew me and called to me and inquired after you ma am and the young #lady# especially miss $marianne_dashwood$ and bid me i should give her compliments and $mr_edward_ferrars$ their best compliments and service and how sorry they was they had not #time# to come on and see you but they was in a great hurry to go forwards for they was going further down for a little while but howsever when they come back they make sure to come and see you
but did she tell you she was married thomas yes ma am she smiled and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts
she was always a very affable and free spoken young #lady# and very civil behaved so i made free to #wish# her joy
yes ma am i just see him leaning back in it but he did not look up he never was a gentleman much for talking
was $mr_edward_ferrars$ in the carriage with her $elinor$ heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward and mrs $marianne_dashwood$ probably found the same explanation
was there no one else in the carriage no ma am only they two do you know where they came from
they come straight from town as $miss_lucy_steele$ mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ told me and are they going farther westward yes ma am but not to bide long
they #will# soon be back again and then they be sure and call here mrs $marianne_dashwood$ now looked at her daughter but $elinor$ knew better than to expect them
she recognised the whole of $miss_lucy_steele$ in the message and was very confident that $mr_edward_ferrars$ would never come near them she observed in a low voice to her #mother# that they were probably going down to mr pratt near plymouth
thomas intelligence seemed over $elinor$ looked as if she wished to hear more did you see them off before you came away
no ma am the horses were just coming out but i could not bide any longer i was afraid of being late
yes ma am she said how she was very well and to my mind she was always a very handsome young #lady#
did mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ look well and she seemed vastly contented mrs $marianne_dashwood$ could think of no other question and thomas and the tablecloth now alike needless were soon afterwards dismissed
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ and $elinor$ appetites were equally lost and $margaret$ might think herself very well off that with so much uneasiness as both her #sister# had lately experienced so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before
when the dessert and the wine were arranged and mrs $marianne_dashwood$ and $elinor$ were left by themselves they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence
$marianne_dashwood$ had already sent to say that she should eat #nothing# more mrs $marianne_dashwood$ feared to hazard any remark and ventured not to offer consolation
she now found that she had erred in relying on $elinor$ representation of herself and justly concluded that every #thing# had been expressly softened at the #time# to spare her from an increase of unhappiness suffering as she then had suffered for $marianne_dashwood$
she found that she had been misled by the careful the considerate attention of her daughter to think the #attachment# which once she had so well understood much slighter in reality than she had been wont to believe or than it was now proved to be
$marianne_dashwood$ affliction because more acknowledged more immediately before her had too much engrossed her tenderness and led her away to forget that in $elinor$ she might have a daughter suffering almost as much certainly with less self provocation and greater fortitude
chapter $elinor$ now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event however certain the mind may be told to consider it and certainty itself
she now found that in spite of herself she had always admitted a hope while $mr_edward_ferrars$ remained single that something would occur to prevent his marrying $miss_lucy_steele$ that some resolution of his own some mediation of friends or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the #lady# would arise to assist the happiness of all
but he was now married and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence
that he should be married soon before as she imagined he could be in orders and consequently before he could be in possession of the living surprised her a little at first
but she soon saw how likely it was that $miss_lucy_steele$ in her self provident care in her haste to secure him should overlook every #thing# but the risk of delay
she feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust inattentive nay almost unkind to her $elinor$ that they were married married in town and now hastening down to her #uncle#
they would soon she supposed be settled at delaford delaford that place in which so much conspired to give her an interest which she wished to be acquainted with and yet desired to avoid
she saw them in an instant in their parsonage #house# saw in $miss_lucy_steele$ the active contriving manager uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality and ashamed to be suspected of #half# her economical practices pursuing her own interest in every thought courting the favour of colonel $mrs_brandon$ of $mrs_jennings$ and of every wealthy friend
in $mr_edward_ferrars$ she knew not what she saw nor what she wished to see happy or unhappy #nothing# pleased her she turned away her head from every sketch of him
$elinor$ flattered herself that some one of their connections in london would write to them to announce the event and give farther particulars but #day# after #day# passed off and brought no #letter# no tidings
what had $mr_edward_ferrars$ felt on being within four miles from $barton$ on seeing her #mother# servant on hearing $miss_lucy_steele$ message though uncertain that any one were to blame she found fault with every absent friend
they were all thoughtless or indolent when do you write to colonel $mrs_brandon$ ma am was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on
i earnestly pressed his coming to us and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow or any #day#
i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to hear from him again
this was gaining something something to look forward to colonel $mrs_brandon$ must have some information to give scarcely had she so determined it when the figure of a #man# on horseback drew her eyes to the window
he stopt at their gate it was a gentleman it was colonel $mrs_brandon$ himself now she could hear more and she trembled in expectation of it
but it was not colonel $mrs_brandon$ neither his air nor his height were it possible she must say it must be $mr_edward_ferrars$ she looked again
he had just dismounted she could not be mistaken it was $mr_edward_ferrars$ she moved away and sat down he comes from mr pratt purposely to see us
i #will# be calm i #will# be mistress of myself in a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake
she saw her #mother# and $marianne_dashwood$ change colour saw them look at herself and whisper a few sentences to each other
she would have given the world to be able to speak and to make them understand that she hoped no coolness no slight would appear in their behaviour to him but
she had no utterance and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion not a syllable passed aloud they all waited in silence for the appearance of their #visitor#
his footsteps were heard along the gravel path in a moment he was in the passage and in another he was before them
his complexion was white with agitation and he looked as if fearful of his reception and conscious that he merited no kind one
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ however conforming as she trusted to the #wish# of that daughter by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every #thing# met with a look of forced complacency gave him her hand and wished him joy
his countenance as he entered the room was not too happy even for $elinor$ he coloured and stammered out an unintelligible reply
$elinor$ lips had moved with her #mother# and when the moment of action was over she wished that she had shaken hands with him too
but it was then too late and with a countenance meaning to be open she sat down again and talked of the weather
$marianne_dashwood$ had retreated as much as possible out of sight to conceal her distress and $margaret$ understanding some part but not the whole of the case thought it incumbent on her to be dignified and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could and maintained a strict silence
it was put an end to by mrs $marianne_dashwood$ who felt obliged to hope that he had left mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ very well
when $elinor$ had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season a very awful pause took place in a hurried manner he replied in the affirmative
another pause $elinor$ resolving to exert herself though fearing the sound of her own voice now said is mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ at longstaple
at longstaple he replied with an air of surprise no my #mother# is in town i meant said $elinor$ taking up some work from the table to inquire for mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$
she dared not look up but her #mother# and $marianne_dashwood$ both turned their eyes on him he coloured seemed perplexed looked doubtingly and after some hesitation said perhaps you mean my brother you mean mrs mrs
$mr_robert_ferrars$ $mr_edward_ferrars$ mrs $mr_robert_ferrars$ $mr_edward_ferrars$ was repeated by $marianne_dashwood$ and her #mother# in an accent of the utmost amazement and though $elinor$ could not speak even her eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder
he rose from his seat and walked to the window apparently from not knowing what to do took up a pair of scissors that lay there and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke said in a hurried voice perhaps you do not know you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to to the youngest to $miss_lucy_steele$
his words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but $elinor$ who sat with her head leaning over her work in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was
yes said he they were married last week and are now at dawlish $elinor$ could sit it no longer
she almost ran out of the room and as soon as the door was closed burst into tears of joy which at first she thought would never cease
$mr_edward_ferrars$ who had till then looked any where rather than at her saw her hurry away and perhaps saw or even heard her emotion for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie which no remarks no inquiries no affectionate address of mrs $marianne_dashwood$ could penetrate and at last without saying a word quitted the room and walked out towards the village leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation so wonderful and so sudden a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures
chapter unaccountable however as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family it was certain that $mr_edward_ferrars$ was free and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre determined by all for after experiencing the blessings of one imprudent engagement contracted without his #mother# consent as he had already done for more than four years #nothing# less could be expected of him in the failure of that than the immediate contraction of another
it was only to ask $elinor$ to marry him and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did so much in need of encouragement and fresh air
how soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution however how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred in what manner he expressed himself and how he was received need not be particularly told
when they all sat down to table at four clock about three hours after his arrival he had secured his #lady# engaged her #mother# consent and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover but in the reality of reason and truth one of the happiest of #man#
his errand at $barton$ in fact was a simple one this only need be said that his situation indeed was more than commonly joyful
he was released without any reproach to himself from an entanglement which had long formed his misery from a woman whom he had long ceased to love and elevated at once to that security with another which he must have thought of almost with despair as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire
he was brought not from doubt or suspense but from misery to happiness and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine flowing grateful cheerfulness as his friends had never witnessed in him before
his heart was now open to $elinor$ all its weaknesses all its errors confessed and his first boyish #attachment# to $miss_lucy_steele$ treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty four
it was a foolish idle inclination on my side said he the consequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment
he had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart and raise his spirits had my #mother# given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr pratt
i think nay i am sure it would never have happened for though i left longstaple with what i thought at the #time# a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit any object to engage my #time# and keep me at a distance from her for a few #month# i should very soon have outgrown the fancied #attachment# especially by mixing more with the world as in such case i must have done
but instead of having any #thing# to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself i returned home to be completely idle and for the first twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen
i had therefore #nothing# in the world to do but to fancy myself in love and as my #mother# did not make my home in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and was always sure of a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part of my #time# there from eighteen to nineteen
at least i thought so then and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no comparisons and see no defects
considering everything therefore i hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every way been proved it was not at the #time# an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly
the change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the dashwoods was such so great as promised them all the satisfaction of a sleepless night
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ too happy to be comfortable knew not how to love $mr_edward_ferrars$ nor praise $elinor$ enough how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together and yet enjoy as she wished the sight and society of both
$miss_lucy_steele$ appeared everything that was amiable and obliging she was pretty too $marianne_dashwood$ could speak her happiness only by tears
comparisons would occur regrets would arise and her joy though sincere as her love for her #sister# was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language
but $elinor$ how are her feelings to be described from the moment of learning that $miss_lucy_steele$ was married to another that $mr_edward_ferrars$ was free to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed she was every #thing# by turns but tranquil
but when the second moment had passed when she found every doubt every solicitude removed compared her situation with what so lately it had been saw
him honourably released from his former engagement saw him instantly profiting by the release to address herself and declare an affection as tender as constant as she had ever supposed it to be she was oppressed she was overcome by her own felicity and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits or any degree of tranquillity to her heart
$mr_edward_ferrars$ was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week for whatever other claims might be made on him it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of $elinor$ company or suffice to say #half# that was to be said of the past the present and the future for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking #will# despatch more #subject# than can really be in common between any two rational creatures yet with lovers it is different
between them no #subject# is finished no communication is even made till it has been made at least twenty #time# over
$miss_lucy_steele$ marriage the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers and $elinor$ particular #knowledge# of each party made it appear to her in every view as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard
how they could be thrown together and by what attraction $mr_robert_ferrars$ could be drawn on to marry a girl of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration a girl too already engaged to his brother and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family it was beyond her comprehension to make out
to her own heart it was a delightful affair to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one but to her reason her judgment it was completely a puzzle
$mr_edward_ferrars$ could only attempt an explanation by supposing that perhaps at first accidentally meeting the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other as to lead by degrees to all the rest
$elinor$ remembered what $mr_robert_ferrars$ had told her in harley street of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother affairs might have done if applied to in #time#
she repeated it to $mr_edward_ferrars$ that was exactly like $mr_robert_ferrars$ was his immediate observation and that he presently added might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began
and $miss_lucy_steele$ perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour other designs might afterward arise
how long it had been carrying on between them however he was equally at a loss with herself to make out for at oxford where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting london he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself and her #letter# to the very last were neither less frequent nor less affectionate than usual
not the smallest suspicion therefore had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed and when at last it burst on him in a #letter# from $miss_lucy_steele$ herself he had been for some #time#
he believed #half# stupified between the wonder the horror and the joy of such a deliverance he put the #letter# into $elinor$ hands
dear sir being very sure i have long lost your affections i have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another and have no doubt of being as happy with him as i once used to think i might be with you but i scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another
sincerely #wish# you happy in your choice and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends as our near relationship now makes proper
i can safely say i owe you no ill #will# and am sure you #will# be too generous to do us any ill offices
your brother has gained my affections entirely and as we could not live without one another we are just returned from the altar and are now on our way to dawlish for a few weeks which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see but thought i would first trouble you with these few lines and shall always remain your sincere well wisher friend and #sister# $miss_lucy_steele$ $mr_edward_ferrars$
i have burnt all your #letter# and #will# return your picture the first opportunity please to destroy my scrawls but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep
i #will# not ask your opinion of it as a composition said $mr_edward_ferrars$ for worlds would not i have had a #letter# of hers seen by you in former #day# in a #sister# it is bad enough but in a wife how i have blushed over the pages of her writing and
i believe i may say that since the first #half# year of our foolish business this is the only #letter# i ever received from her of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style
$elinor$ read and returned it without any comment however it may have come about said $elinor$ after a pause they are certainly married
the independence she settled on $mr_robert_ferrars$ through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own choice and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a year to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do
she #will# hardly be less hurt i suppose by $mr_robert_ferrars$ marrying $miss_lucy_steele$ than she would have been by your marrying her
she #will# be more hurt by it for $mr_robert_ferrars$ always was her favourite she #will# be more hurt by it and on the same principle #will# forgive him much sooner
in what state the affair stood at present between them $mr_edward_ferrars$ knew not for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him
he had quitted oxford within four and twenty hours after $miss_lucy_steele$ #letter# arrived and with only one object before him the nearest road to $barton$ had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection
he could do #nothing# till he were assured of his fate with miss $marianne_dashwood$ and by his rapidity in seeking that fate it is to be supposed in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of colonel $mrs_brandon$ in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts he did not upon the whole expect a very cruel reception
and your #mother# has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment it was his business however to say that he did and he said it very prettily
that $miss_lucy_steele$ had certainly meant to deceive to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by thomas was perfectly clear to $elinor$ and $mr_edward_ferrars$ himself now thoroughly enlightened on her character had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill nature
though his eyes had been long opened even before his acquaintance with $elinor$ began to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions they had been equally imputed by him to her want of education and till her last #letter# reached him he had always believed her to be a well disposed good hearted girl and thoroughly attached to himself
#nothing# but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement which long before the discovery of it laid him open to his #mother# anger had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him
what he might say on the #subject# a twelvemonth after must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives
i thought it my #duty# said he independent of my feelings to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not when i was renounced by my #mother# and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me
in such a situation as that where there seemed #nothing# to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any #thing# but the most disinterested affection was her inducement
and even now i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted or what fancied advantage it could be to her to be fettered to a #man# for whom she had not the smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world
she could not foresee that colonel $mrs_brandon$ would give me a living no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in #time# relent
and at any rate she lost #nothing# by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions
the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if #nothing# more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single
$mr_edward_ferrars$ was of course immediately convinced that #nothing# could have been more natural than $miss_lucy_steele$ conduct nor more self evident than the motive of it
$elinor$ scolded him harshly as #lady# always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves for having spent so much #time# with them at norland when he must have felt his own inconstancy
your behaviour was certainly very wrong said she because to say #nothing# of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be
he could only plead an ignorance of his own heart and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement
i was simple enough to think that because my faith was plighted to another there could be no danger in my being with you and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour
i felt that i admired you but i told myself it was only friendship and till i began to make comparisons between yourself and $miss_lucy_steele$ i did not know how far i was got
after that i suppose i was wrong in remaining so much in sussex and the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the expediency of it were no better than these the danger is my own i am doing no injury to anybody but myself
$mr_edward_ferrars$ heard with pleasure of colonel $mrs_brandon$ being expected at the cottage as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of delaford which at present said he after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven him for offering
$elinor$ smiled and shook her head now he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place
but so little interest had he taken in the matter that he owed all his #knowledge# of the #house# garden and glebe extent of the parish condition of the land and rate of the tithes to $elinor$ herself who had heard so much of it from colonel $mrs_brandon$ and heard it with so much attention as to be entirely mistress of the #subject#
they were brought together by mutual affection with the warmest approbation of their real friends their intimate #knowledge# of each other seemed to make their happiness certain and they only wanted something to live upon
$mr_edward_ferrars$ had two thousand pounds and $elinor$ one which with delaford living was all that they could call their own for it was impossible that mrs $marianne_dashwood$ should advance anything and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a year would supply them with the comforts of life
$mr_edward_ferrars$ was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his #mother# towards him and on that he rested for the residue of their income
but $elinor$ had no such dependence for since $mr_edward_ferrars$ would still be unable to marry $miss_morton$ and his chusing herself had been spoken of in mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing $miss_lucy_steele$ she feared that $mr_robert_ferrars$ offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich $fanny$
about four #day# after $mr_edward_ferrars$ arrival colonel $mrs_brandon$ appeared to complete mrs $marianne_dashwood$ satisfaction and to give her the dignity of having for the first #time# since her living at $barton$ more company with her than her #house# would hold
$mr_edward_ferrars$ was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer and colonel $mrs_brandon$ therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the park from whence he usually returned in the morning early enough to interrupt the lovers first tete a tete before breakfast
a three weeks residence at delaford where in his evening hours at least he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty six and seventeen brought him to $barton$ in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in $marianne_dashwood$ looks all the kindness of her welcome and all the encouragement of her #mother# language to make it cheerful
one question after this only remained undecided between them one difficulty only was to be overcome among such friends however and such flattery he did revive
no rumour of $miss_lucy_steele$ marriage had yet reached him he knew #nothing# of what had passed and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering
every #thing# was explained to him by mrs $marianne_dashwood$ and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for $mr_edward_ferrars$ since eventually it promoted the interest of $elinor$
it would be needless to say that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other as they advanced in each other acquaintance for it could not be otherwise
their resemblance in good principles and good #sense# in disposition and manner of thinking would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship without any other attraction but their being in love with two #sister# and two #sister# fond of each other made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate which might otherwise have waited the effect of #time# and judgment
the #letter# from town which a few #day# before would have made every nerve in $elinor$ body thrill with transport now arrived to be read with less emotion than mirth
$mrs_jennings$ wrote to tell the wonderful tale to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl and pour forth her compassion towards poor $mr_edward_ferrars$ who she was sure had quite doted upon the worthless hussy and was now by all accounts almost broken hearted at oxford
i do think she continued #nothing# was ever carried on so sly for it was but two #day# before $miss_lucy_steele$ called and sat a couple of hours with me
came crying to me the #day# after in a great fright for fear of mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ as well as not knowing how to get to plymouth for $miss_lucy_steele$ it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married on purpose we suppose to make a show with and poor nancy had not seven shillings in the world so
i was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to exeter where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with mrs burgess in hopes as i tell her to fall in with the doctor again
and i must say that $miss_lucy_steele$ crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all
i cannot get him out of my head but you must send for him to $barton$ and miss $marianne_dashwood$ must try to comfort him
not a soul suspected anything of the matter not even nancy who poor soul poor $mr_edward_ferrars$ mr $marianne_dashwood$ strains were more solemn
mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ was the most unfortunate of women poor $fanny$ had suffered agonies of sensibility and he considered the existence of each under such a blow with grateful wonder
neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ and even if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter nor be permitted to appear in her presence
the secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime because had any suspicion of it occurred to the others proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage and he called on $elinor$ to join with him in regretting that $miss_lucy_steele$ engagement with $mr_edward_ferrars$ had not rather been fulfilled than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family
he thus continued mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ has never yet mentioned $mr_edward_ferrars$ name which does not surprise us but to our great astonishment not a line has been received from him on the occasion
perhaps however he is kept silent by his fear of offending and i shall therefore give him a hint by a line to oxford that his #sister# and i both think a #letter# of proper submission from him addressed perhaps to $fanny$ and by her shewn to her #mother# might not be taken amiss
for we all know the tenderness of mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ heart and that she #wish# for #nothing# so much as to be on good terms with her children
$mr_robert_ferrars$ offence was unpardonable but $miss_lucy_steele$ was infinitely worse this paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of $mr_edward_ferrars$
it determined him to attempt a reconciliation though not exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and #sister#
repeated he would they have me beg my #mother# pardon for $mr_robert_ferrars$ ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can make no submission
i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know of no submission that is proper for me to make
i should think you might now venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your #mother# anger
a #letter# of proper submission you may certainly ask to be forgiven said $elinor$ because you have offended and he agreed that he might
and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first
he had #nothing# to urge against it but still resisted the idea of a #letter# of proper submission and therefore to make it easier to him as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper it was resolved that instead of writing to $fanny$ he should go to london and personally intreat her good offices in his favour
and if they really do interest themselves said $marianne_dashwood$ in her new character of candour in bringing about a reconciliation i shall think that even $mrs_john_dashwood$ and $fanny$ are not entirely without merit
after a visit on colonel $mrs_brandon$ side of only three or four #day# the two gentlemen quitted $barton$ together
they were to go immediately to delaford that $mr_edward_ferrars$ might have some personal #knowledge# of his future home and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it and from thence after staying there a couple of nights he was to proceed on his journey to town
after a proper resistance on the part of mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring the reproach of being too amiable $mr_edward_ferrars$ was admitted to her presence and pronounced to be again her son
for many years of her life she had had two sons but the crime and annihilation of $mr_edward_ferrars$ a few weeks ago had robbed her of one the similar annihilation of $mr_robert_ferrars$ had left her for a fortnight without any and now by the resuscitation of $mr_edward_ferrars$ she had one again
in spite of his being allowed once more to live however he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure till he had revealed his present engagement for the publication of that circumstance he feared might give a sudden turn to his constitution and carry him off as rapidly as before
chapter her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating with apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed and he was listened to with unexpected calmness
mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying miss $marianne_dashwood$ by every argument in her power told him that in $miss_morton$ he would have a woman of higher rank and larger #fortune# and
enforced the assertion by observing that $miss_morton$ was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds while miss $marianne_dashwood$ was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than three but when she found that though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation he was by no means inclined to be guided by it she judged it wisest from the experience of the past to submit and therefore after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity and as served to prevent every suspicion of good #will# she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of $mr_edward_ferrars$ and $elinor$
what she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered and here it plainly appeared that though $mr_edward_ferrars$ was now her only son he was by no means her eldest for while $mr_robert_ferrars$ was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a year not the smallest objection was made against $mr_edward_ferrars$ taking orders for the #sake# of two hundred and fifty at the utmost nor was anything promised either for the present or in future beyond the ten thousand pounds which had been given with $fanny$
it was as much however as was desired and more than was expected by $mr_edward_ferrars$ and $elinor$ and mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ herself by her shuffling excuses seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more
with an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them they had #nothing# to wait for after $mr_edward_ferrars$ was in possession of the living but the readiness of the #house# to which colonel $mrs_brandon$ with an eager desire for the accommodation of $elinor$ was making considerable improvements and after waiting some #time# for their completion after experiencing as usual a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen $elinor$ as usual broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every #thing# was ready and the ceremony took place in $barton$ church early in the autumn
the first #month# after their marriage was spent with their friend at the mansion #house# from whence they could superintend the progress of the parsonage and direct every #thing# as they liked on the spot could chuse papers project shrubberies and invent a sweep
$mrs_jennings$ prophecies though rather jumbled together were chiefly fulfilled for she was able to visit $mr_edward_ferrars$ and his wife in their parsonage by michaelmas and she found in $elinor$ and her husband as she really believed one of the happiest couples in the world
they had in fact #nothing# to #wish# for but the marriage of colonel $mrs_brandon$ and $marianne_dashwood$ and rather better pasturage for their cows
mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ came to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed of having authorised and even the dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from sussex to do them honour
i #will# not say that i am disappointed my dear #sister# said $mrs_john_dashwood$ as they were walking together one morning before the gates of delaford #house# that would be saying too much for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world as it is
they were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations and friends but i confess it would give me great pleasure to call colonel $mrs_brandon$ brother
his property here his place his #house# every #thing# is in such respectable and excellent condition and his woods i have not seen such timber any where in dorsetshire as there is now standing in delaford hanger and though perhaps $marianne_dashwood$ may not seem exactly the person to attract him yet i think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you for as colonel $mrs_brandon$ seems a great deal at home nobody can tell what may happen for when people are much thrown together and see little of anybody else and it #will# always be in your power to set her off to advantage and so forth in short you may as well give her a chance
but though mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ did come to see them and always treated them with the make believe of decent affection they were never insulted by her real favour and preference
that was due to the folly of $mr_robert_ferrars$ and the cunning of his wife and it was earned by them before many #month# had passed away
the selfish sagacity of the latter which had at first drawn $mr_robert_ferrars$ into the scrape was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it for her respectful humility assiduous attentions and endless flatteries as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise reconciled mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ to his choice and re established him completely in her favour
the whole of $miss_lucy_steele$ behaviour in the affair and the prosperity which crowned it therefore may be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest an unceasing attention to self interest however its progress may be apparently obstructed #will# do in securing every advantage of #fortune# with no other sacrifice than that of #time# and conscience
when $mr_robert_ferrars$ first sought her acquaintance and privately visited her in bartlett buildings it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother
he merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement and as there could be #nothing# to overcome but the affection of both he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter
in that point however and that only he erred for though $miss_lucy_steele$ soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in #time# another visit another conversation was always wanted to produce this conviction
some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted which could only be removed by another #half# hour discourse with himself
instead of talking of $mr_edward_ferrars$ they came gradually to talk only of $mr_robert_ferrars$ a #subject# on which he had always more to say than on any other and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own and in short it became speedily evident to both that he had entirely supplanted his brother
you understand me his attendance was by this means secured and the rest followed in course he was proud of his conquest proud of tricking $mr_edward_ferrars$ and very proud of marrying privately without his #mother# consent
they passed some #month# in great happiness at dawlish for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages and from thence returning to town procured the forgiveness of mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ by the simple expedient of asking it which at $miss_lucy_steele$ instigation was adopted
the forgiveness at first indeed as was reasonable comprehended only $mr_robert_ferrars$ and $miss_lucy_steele$ who had owed his #mother# no #duty# and therefore could have transgressed none still remained some weeks longer unpardoned
but perseverance in humility of conduct and messages in self condemnation for $mr_robert_ferrars$ offence and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with procured her in #time# the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness and led soon afterwards by rapid degrees to the highest state of affection and influence
$miss_lucy_steele$ became as necessary to mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ as either $mr_robert_ferrars$ or $fanny$ and while $mr_edward_ferrars$ was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her and $elinor$ though superior to her in #fortune# and birth was spoken of as an intruder she was in every #thing# considered and always openly acknowledged to be a favourite child
they settled in town received very liberal assistance from mrs $mr_edward_ferrars$ were on the best terms imaginable with the dashwoods and setting aside the jealousies and ill #will# continually subsisting between $fanny$ and $miss_lucy_steele$ in which their husbands of course took a part as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between $mr_robert_ferrars$ and $miss_lucy_steele$ themselves #nothing# could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together
what $mr_edward_ferrars$ had done to forfeit the right of eldest son might have puzzled many people to find out and what $mr_robert_ferrars$ had done to succeed to it might have puzzled them still more
it was an arrangement however justified in its effects if not in its cause for #nothing# ever appeared in $mr_robert_ferrars$ style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income as either leaving his brother too little or bringing himself too much and if $mr_edward_ferrars$ might be judged from the ready discharge of his #duty# in every particular from an increasing #attachment# to his wife and his home and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits he might be supposed no less contented with his lot no less free from every #wish# of an exchange
$elinor$ marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived without rendering the cottage at $barton$ entirely useless for her #mother# and #sister# spent much more than #half# their #time# with her
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at delaford for her #wish# of bringing $marianne_dashwood$ and colonel $mrs_brandon$ together was hardly less earnest though rather more liberal than what $mrs_john_dashwood$ had expressed
precious as was the company of her daughter to her she desired #nothing# so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend and to see $marianne_dashwood$ settled at the mansion #house# was equally the #wish# of $mr_edward_ferrars$ and $elinor$
they each felt his #sorrow# and their own obligations and $marianne_dashwood$ by general consent was to be the reward of all
with such a confederacy against her with a #knowledge# so intimate of his goodness with a conviction of his fond #attachment# to herself which at last though long after it was observable to everybody else burst on her what could she do
she was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions and to counteract by her conduct her most favourite maxims
she was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship voluntarily to give her hand to another and that other a #man# who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former #attachment# whom two years before she had considered too old to be married and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat
what immediately followed is known it was now her darling object $marianne_dashwood$ was born to an extraordinary fate but so it was
instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting instead of remaining even for ever with her #mother# and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on she found herself at nineteen submitting to new #attachment# entering on new #duty# placed in a new home a wife the mistress of a family and the patroness of a village
colonel $mrs_brandon$ was now as happy as all those who best loved him believed he deserved to be in $marianne_dashwood$ he was consoled for every past affliction her regard and her society restored his mind to animation and his spirits to cheerfulness and that $marianne_dashwood$ found her own happiness in forming his was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend
$marianne_dashwood$ could never love by #half# and her whole heart became in #time# as much devoted to her husband as it had once been to $mrs_willoughby$
$mrs_willoughby$ could not hear of her marriage without a pang and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of $mrs_smith$ who by stating his marriage with a woman of character as the source of her clemency gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards $marianne_dashwood$ he might at once have been happy and rich
that his repentance of misconduct which thus brought its own punishment was sincere need not be doubted nor that he long thought of colonel $mrs_brandon$ with envy and of $marianne_dashwood$ with regret
but that he was for ever inconsolable that he fled from society or contracted an habitual gloom of temper or died of a broken heart must not be depended on for he did neither
his wife was not always out of humour nor his home always uncomfortable and in his breed of horses and dogs and in sporting of every kind he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity
for $marianne_dashwood$ however in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every #thing# that befell her and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after #day# as bearing no comparison with $mrs_brandon$
mrs $marianne_dashwood$ was prudent enough to remain at the cottage without attempting a removal to delaford and fortunately for sir $mrs_john_dashwood$ and $mrs_jennings$ when $marianne_dashwood$ was taken from them $margaret$ had reached an age highly suitable for dancing and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover
between $barton$ and delaford there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate and among the merits and the happiness of $elinor$ and $marianne_dashwood$ let it not be ranked as the least considerable that though #sister# and living almost within sight of each other they could live without disagreement between themselves or producing coolness between their husbands
