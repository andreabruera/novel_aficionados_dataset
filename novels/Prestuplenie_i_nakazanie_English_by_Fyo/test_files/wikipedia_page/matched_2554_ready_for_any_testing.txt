crime and punishment pre reform russian преступленіе наказаніе post reform russian преступление наказание tr prestupléniye nakazániye ipa is novel by the russian author fyodor dostoevsky
it was first published in the literary journal the russian messenger in twelve monthly installments during it was later published in single volume
it is the second of dostoevsky full length novels following his return from years of exile in siberia crime and punishment is considered the first great novel of his mature period of writing
crime and punishment focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov mr_raskolnikov an impoverished ex student in saint petersburg who formulates plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her money
before the killing mr_raskolnikov believes that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds
his moral justifications disintegrate completely as he struggles with guilt and horror and confronts the real world consequences of his deed
dostoevsky conceived the idea of crime and punishment prompted by the case of pierre françois lacenaire in the summer of
he had been working on another project at the time entitled the drunkards which was to deal with the present question of drunkenness all its ramifications especially the picture of family and the bringing up of child in these circumstances etc etc
however once it is done he finds himself racked with confusion paranoia and disgust for what he has done this theme centering on the story of the sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov family became ancillary to the story of mr_raskolnikov and his crime
at the time dostoevsky owed large sums of money to creditors and was trying to help the family of his brother mikhail who had died in early
after appeals elsewhere failed dostoevsky turned as last resort to the publisher mikhail katkov and sought an advance on proposed contribution
for publication in katkov monthly journal the russian messenger a prestigious publication of its kind and the outlet for both ivan turgenev and leo tolstoy
in letter to katkov written in september dostoevsky explained to him that the work was to be about young man who yields to certain strange unfinished ideas yet floating in the air
he planned to explore the moral and psychological dangers of the ideology of radicalism and felt that the project would appeal to the conservative katkov
dostoevsky having carried on quite bruising polemics with katkov in the early had never published anything in its pages before in letters written in november an important conceptual change occurred the story has become novel
from then on crime and punishment is referred to as novel at the end of november much had been written and was ready burned it all can confess that now
dostoevsky letter to his friend alexander wrangel in february because of these labors there is now fragmentary working draft of the story or novella as initially conceived as well as two other versions of the text
these have been distinguished as the wiesbaden edition the petersburg edition and the final plan involving the shift from first person narrator to the indigenous variety of third person form invented by dostoevsky
a new form new plan excited me and started all over again the wiesbaden edition concentrates entirely on the moral and psychological reactions of the narrator after the murder
it coincides roughly with the story that dostoevsky described in his letter to katkov and written in the form of diary or journal corresponds to what eventually became part
i wrote with genuine inspiration but perhaps it is no good but for them the question is not its literary worth they are worried about its morality
nothing was against morality and even quite the contrary but they saw otherwise and what more saw traces of nihilism
i took it back and this revision of large chapter cost me at least three new chapters of work judging by the effort and the weariness but corrected it and gave it back
according to joseph frank one possibility is that his protagonist began to develop beyond the boundaries in which he had first been conceived
the final version of crime and punishment came into being only when in november dostoevsky decided to recast his novel in the third person
here was in the right why dostoevsky abandoned his initial version remains matter of speculation this shift was the culmination of long struggle present through all the early stages of composition
once having decided dostoevsky began to rewrite from scratch and was able to easily integrate sections of the early manuscript into the final text
dostoevsky was under great pressure to finish crime and punishment on time as he was simultaneously contracted to finish the gambler for stellovsky who had imposed extremely harsh conditions
frank says that he did not as he told wrangel burn everything he had written earlier anna snitkina stenographer who later became dostoevsky wife was of great help to him during this difficult task
the first part of crime and punishment appeared in the january issue of the russian messenger and the last one was published in december
isolated and antisocial he has abandoned all attempts to support himself and is brooding obsessively on scheme he has devised to murder and rob an elderly pawn broker

the next day mr_raskolnikov receives letter from his mother in which she describes the problems of his sister dunya who has been working as governess with her ill intentioned employer svidrigailov
to escape her vulnerable position and with hope of helping her brother dunya has chosen to marry wealthy suitor pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin whom they are coming to meet in petersburg
details in the letter suggest that pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin is conceited opportunist who is seeking to take advantage of dunya situation mr_raskolnikov is enraged at his sister sacrifice feeling it is the same as what sonya felt compelled to do
painfully aware of his own poverty and impotence his thought return to his idea a further series of internal and external events seem to conspire to compel him toward the resolution to enact it

due to sheer good fortune he manages to escape the building and return to his room undetected in feverish semi delirious state mr_raskolnikov conceals the stolen items and falls asleep exhausted
he is greatly alarmed the next morning when he gets summons to the police station but it turns out to be in relation to debt notice from his landlady
when the officers at the bureau begin talking about the murder mr_raskolnikov faints he quickly recovers but he can see from their faces that he has aroused suspicion
fearing search he hides the stolen items under building block in an empty yard noticing in humiliation that he hasnt even checked how much money is in the purse
without knowing why he visits his old university friend razumikhin who observes that mr_raskolnikov seems to be seriously ill finally he returns to his room where he succumbs to his illness and falls into prolonged delirium
still feverish mr_raskolnikov listens nervously to conversation between razumikhin and the doctor about the status of the police investigation into the murders muzhik called mikolka who was working in neighbouring flat at the time has been detained and the old woman clients are being interviewed
they are interrupted by the arrival of pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin dunya fiancé who wishes to introduce himself but mr_raskolnikov deliberately insults him and kicks him out
when he emerges several day later he finds that razumikhin has tracked him down and has been nursing him he angrily tells the others to leave as well and then sneaks out himself
he looks for news about the murder and seems almost to want to draw attention to his own part in it
he encounters the police official zamyotov who was present when he fainted in the bureau and openly mocks the young man unspoken suspicions
he angers the workmen and caretakers by asking casual questions about the murder even suggesting that they accompany him to the police station to discuss it
he returns to the scene of the crime and re lives the sensations he experienced at the time as he contemplates whether or not to confess he sees sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov who has been struck mortally by carriage
he rushes to help and succeeds in conveying the stricken man back to his family apartment calling out for sonya to forgive him sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov dies in his daughter arms
mr_raskolnikov gives his last twenty five rouble from money sent to him by his mother to sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov consumptive widow katerina_ivanovna saying it is the repayment of debt to his friend
feeling renewed mr_raskolnikov calls on razumikhin and they go back together to mr_raskolnikov building upon entering his room mr_raskolnikov is deeply shocked to see his mother and sister sitting on the sofa
they have just arrived in petersburg and are ecstatic to see him but mr_raskolnikov is unable to speak and collapses in faint
razumikhin tends to mr_raskolnikov and manages to convince the distressed mother and sister to return to their apartment he goes with them despite being drunk and rather overwhelmed by dunya beauty
when they return the next morning mr_raskolnikov has improved physically but it becomes apparent that he is still mentally distracted and merely forcing himself to endure the meeting
he demands that dunya break with pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin but dunya fiercely defends her motives for the marriage mrs mr_raskolnikov has received note from pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin demanding that her son not be present at any future meetings between them
dunya has decided that meeting at which both pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin and her brother are present must take place and mr_raskolnikov agrees to attend that evening along with razumikhin
he also informs her that he witnessed her son give the rubles to an unmarried woman of immoral behavior sonya to mr_raskolnikov surprize sonya suddenly appears at his door
timidly she explains that he left his address with them last night and that she has come to invite him to attend her father funeral
as she leaves mr_raskolnikov asks for her address and tells her that he will visit her soon at mr_raskolnikov behest razumikhin takes him to see the detective porfiry_petrovitch petrovich who is investigating the murders
mr_raskolnikov immediately senses that porfiry_petrovitch knows that he is the murderer porfiry_petrovitch who has just been discussing the case with zamyotov adopts an ironic tone during the conversation
he expresses extreme curiosity about an article that mr_raskolnikov wrote some months ago called on crime in which he suggests that certain rare individuals the benefactors and geniuses of mankind have right to tep across legal or moral boundaries if those boundaries are an obstruction to the success of their idea
mr_raskolnikov defends himself skillfully but he is alarmed and angered by porfiry_petrovitch insinuating tone an appointment is made for an interview the following morning at the police bureau
leaving razumikhin with his mother and sister mr_raskolnikov returns to his own building he is surprised to find an old artisan who he doesnt know making inquiries about him
mr_raskolnikov tries to find out what he wants but the artisan says only one word murderer and walks off petrified mr_raskolnikov returns to his room and falls into thought and then sleep
he wakes to find another complete stranger present this time man of aristocratic appearance the man politely introduces himself as arkady ivanovich svidrigailov
he claims to no longer have any romantic interest in dunya but wants to stop her from marrying pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin and offer her ten thousand rouble
svidrigailov indulges in an amiable but disjointed monologue punctuated by mr_raskolnikov terse interjections mr_raskolnikov refuses the money on her behalf and refuses to facilitate meeting
svidrigailov also mentions that his wife who defended dunya at the time of the unpleasantness but died shortly afterwards has left her rubles in her will
the meeting with pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin that evening begins with talk of svidrigailov his depraved character his presence in petersburg the unexpected death of his wife and the rubles left to dunya
pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin takes offence when dunya insists on resolving the issue with her brother and when mr_raskolnikov draws attention to the slander in his letter he becomes reckless exposing his true character
now free and with significant capital they excitedly begin to discuss plans for the future but mr_raskolnikov suddenly gets up and leaves telling them to their great consternation that it might be the last time he sees them
dunya tells him to leave and never come back he instructs the baffled razumikhin to remain and always care for them
she is gratified that he is visiting her but also frightened of his strange manner he asks series of merciless questions about her terrible situation and that of katerina_ivanovna and the child
mr_raskolnikov begins to realize that sonya is sustained only by her faith in god she passionately reads to him the story of the raising of lazarus from the gospel of john
his fascination with her which had begun at the time when her father spoke of her increases and he sees that they must face the future together
when mr_raskolnikov presents himself for his interview porfiry_petrovitch resumes and intensifies his insinuating provocative ironic chatter without ever making direct accusation
with mr_raskolnikov anger reaching fever pitch porfiry_petrovitch hints that he has little surprise for him behind the partition in his office but at that moment there is commotion outside the door and young man
as he leaves he tells her that he will come back tomorrow and tell her who killed her friend lizaveta_ivanovna mikolka the painter bursts in followed by some policemen
to both porfiry_petrovitch and mr_raskolnikov astonishment mikolka proceeds to loudly confess to the murders porfiry_petrovitch doesnt believe the confession but he is forced to let mr_raskolnikov go
but the man bows to him and asks for forgiveness he had been porfiry_petrovitch little surprise and had heard the other man confess
he had been one of those present when mr_raskolnikov returned to the scene of the murders and had reported his behavior to porfiry_petrovitch
back at his room mr_raskolnikov is horrified when the old artisan suddenly appears at his door mr_raskolnikov attends the marmeladovs post funeral banquet at katerina_ivanovna apartment
the atmosphere deteriorates as guests become drunk and the half mad katerina_ivanovna engages in verbal attack on her german landlady
he sternly announces that ruble banknote disappeared from his apartment at the precise time that he was being visited by sonya whom he had invited in order to make small donation
with chaos descending everyone is surprised by the sudden and portentous appearance of pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin sonya fearfully denies stealing the money but pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin persists in his accusation and demands that someone search her
outraged katerina_ivanovna abuses pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin and sets about emptying sonya pocket to prove her innocence but folded ruble note does indeed fly out of one of the pocket
but pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin roommate lebezyatnikov angrily asserts that he saw pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin surreptitiously slip the money into sonya pocket as she left although he had thought at the time that it was noble act of anonymous charity
mr_raskolnikov backs lebezyatnikov by confidently identifying pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin motive desire to avenge himself on mr_raskolnikov by defaming sonya in hope of causing rift with his family
the mood in the room turns against sonya pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin chastises her and the landlady orders the family out pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin is discredited but sonya is traumatized and she runs out of the apartment
back at her room mr_raskolnikov draws sonya attention to the ease with which pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin could have ruined her and consequently the child as well
but it is only prelude to his confession that he is the murderer of the old woman and lizaveta_ivanovna painfully he tries to explain his abstract motives for the crime to the uncomprehending sonya
she is horrified not just at the crime but at his own self torture and tells him that he must hand himself in to the police
lebezyatnikov appears and tells them that the landlady has kicked katerina_ivanovna out of the apartment and that she has gone mad
they find katerina_ivanovna surrounded by people in the street completely insane trying to force the terrified child to perform for money and near death from her illness
to mr_raskolnikov surprise svidrigailov suddenly appears and informs him that he will be using the ten thousand rubles intended for dunya to make the funeral arrangements and to place the child in good orphanages
when mr_raskolnikov asks him what his motives are he laughingly replies with direct quotations of mr_raskolnikov own words spoken when he was trying to explain his justifications for the murder to sonya
they manage to get her back to sonya room where distraught and raving she dies svidrigailov has been residing next door to sonya and overheard every word of the confession
razumikhin tells mr_raskolnikov that dunya has become troubled and distant after receiving letter from someone he also mentions to mr_raskolnikov astonishment that porfiry_petrovitch no longer suspects him of the murders
as mr_raskolnikov is about to set off in search of svidrigailov porfiry_petrovitch himself appears and politely requests brief chat he sincerely apologises for his previous behavior and seeks to explain the reasons behind it
but porfiry_petrovitch changed attitude is motivated by genuine respect for mr_raskolnikov not by any thought of his innocence and he concludes by expressing his absolute certainty that mr_raskolnikov is indeed the murderer
strangely mr_raskolnikov begins to feel alarmed at the thought that porfiry_petrovitch might think he is innocent he claims that he will be arresting him soon but urges him to confess to make it easier on himself
svidrigailov who has in fact arranged to meet dunya threatens him with the police but mr_raskolnikov is unconcerned and follows him home
when raskonikov finally departs dunya who has been watching them approaches svidrigailov and demands to know what he meant in his letter about her brother ecret
she reluctantly accompanies him to his rooms where he reveals what he overheard and attempts to use it to make her yield to his desire
mr_raskolnikov chooses to continue the struggle mr_raskolnikov finds svidrigailov at an inn and warns him against approaching dunya dunya however has gun and she fires at him narrowly missing svidrigailov gently encourages her to reload and try again
eventually she throws the gun aside but svidrigailov crushed by her hatred for him tells her to leave later that evening he goes to sonya to discuss the arrangements for katerina_ivanovna child
he gives her rubles telling her she will need it if she wishes to follow mr_raskolnikov to siberia he spends the night in miserable hotel and the following morning commits suicide in public place
dunya is waiting for him at his room and he tells her that he will be going to the police to confess to the murders
mr_raskolnikov says painful goodbye to his mother without telling her the truth he stops at sonya place on the way and she gives him crucifix
but he sees sonya who has followed him looking at him in despair and he returns to make full and frank confession that he is the murderer
due to the fullness of his confession at time when another man had already confessed mr_raskolnikov is sentenced to only eight years of penal servitude
at the bureau he learns of svidrigailov suicide and almost changes his mind even leaving the building dunya and razumikhin marry and plan to move to siberia but mr_raskolnikov mother falls ill and dies
sonya follows mr_raskolnikov to siberia but he is initially hostile towards her as he is still struggling to acknowledge any moral culpability for his crime feeling himself to be guilty only of weakness
it is only after some time in prison that his redemption and moral regeneration begin under sonya loving influence an acute accent marks the stressed syllable
in crime and punishment dostoevsky fuses the personality of his main character rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov romanovich mr_raskolnikov with his new anti radical ideological themes
the main plot involves murder as the result of ideological intoxication and depicts all the disastrous moral and psychical consequences that result from the murder
mr_raskolnikov psychology is placed at the center and carefully interwoven with the ideas behind his transgression every other feature of the novel illuminates the agonizing dilemma in which mr_raskolnikov is caught
from another point of view the novel plot is another variation of conventional nineteenth century theme an innocent young provincial comes to seek his fortune in the capital where he succumbs to corruption and loses all traces of his former freshness and purity
however as gary rosenshield point out mr_raskolnikov succumbs not to the temptations of high society as honoré de balzac rastignac or stendhal julien sorel but to those of rationalistic petersburg
a year old man and former student now destitute mr_raskolnikov is described in the novel as exceptionally handsome above the average in height slim well built with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair
mr_raskolnikov rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov is the protagonist and the novel focuses primarily on his perspective perhaps the most striking feature of mr_raskolnikov however is his dual personality
on the one hand he is cold apathetic and antisocial on the other he can be surprisingly warm and compassionate he commits murder as well as acts of impulsive charity
his chaotic interaction with the external world and his nihilistic worldview might be seen as causes of his social alienation or consequences of it
despite its title the novel does not so much deal with the crime and its formal punishment as with mr_raskolnikov internal struggle the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law
believing society would be better for it mr_raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness
it is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment having decided to confess and end his alienation from society
sonya sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov marmeladova is the daughter of drunkard named semyon zakharovich sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov whom mr_raskolnikov meets in tavern at the beginning of the novel
mr_raskolnikov discerns in her the same feelings of shame and alienation that he experiences and she becomes the first person to whom he confesses his crime
she is often characterized as self sacrificial shy and innocent despite being forced into prostitution to help her family sensing his deep unhappiness she supports him even though she was friend with one of the victims lizaveta_ivanovna
throughout the novel sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for mr_raskolnikov razumíkhin dmitry prokofyich is mr_raskolnikov loyal friend and also former law student
the character is intended to represent something of reconciliation between faith and reason razum sense intelligence he jokes that his name is actually vrazumíkhin a name suggesting to bring someone to their senses
he is upright strong resourceful and intelligent but also somewhat naïve qualities that are of great importance to mr_raskolnikov in his desperate situation
he admires mr_raskolnikov intelligence and character refuses to give any credence to others suspicions and supports him at all times he looks after mr_raskolnikov family when they come to petersburg and falls in love with dunya
she initially plans to marry the wealthy but unsavory lawyer pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin thinking it will enable her to ease her family desperate financial situation and escape her former employer svidrigailov
dunya avdotya_romanovna raskolnikova mr_raskolnikov beautiful and strong willed sister who works as governess her situation is factor in mr_raskolnikov decision to commit the murder
in petersburg she is eventually able to escape the clutches of both pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin and svidrigailov and later marries razumikhin pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin pyotr petrovich
his motives for the marriage are dubious as he more or less states that he has sought woman who will be completely beholden to him
a well off lawyer who is engaged to dunya in the beginning of the novel he slanders and falsely accuses sonya of theft in an attempt to harm mr_raskolnikov relations with his family
pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin represents immorality in contrast to mr_svidrigaïlov amorality and mr_raskolnikov misguided morality mr_svidrigaïlov arkady ivanovich sensual depraved and wealthy former employer and current pursuer of dunya
he overhears mr_raskolnikov confessions to sonya and uses this knowledge to torment both dunya and mr_raskolnikov but does not inform the police
despite his apparent malevolence mr_svidrigaïlov seems to be capable of generosity and compassion when dunya tells him she could never love him after attempting to shoot him
he tells sonya that he has made financial arrangements for the sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov child to enter an orphanage and gives her three thousand rubles enabling her to follow mr_raskolnikov to siberia
the head of the investigation department in charge of solving the murders of lizaveta_ivanovna and alyona katerina_ivanovna who along with sonya moves mr_raskolnikov towards confession
unlike sonya however porfiry_petrovitch does this through psychological means seeking to confuse and provoke the volatile mr_raskolnikov into voluntary or involuntary confession
he lets her go having left the rest of his money to his juvenile fiancée he commits suicide porfiry_petrovitch petrovich he later drops these methods and sincerely urges mr_raskolnikov to confess for his own good
pulkheria alexandrovna raskolnikova mr_raskolnikov naïve hopeful and loving mother following mr_raskolnikov sentence she falls ill mentally and physically and eventually dies

she is obsessed with demonstrating that slum life is far below her station following sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov death she uses the money mr_raskolnikov gives her to hold funeral
she eventually succumbs to her illness andrey semyonovich lebezyatnikov pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin utopian socialist roommate who witnesses his attempt to frame sonya and subsequently exposes him
he is proven right by mr_raskolnikov the only one knowing of pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin motives alyona katerina_ivanovna suspicious old pawnbroker who hoards money and is merciless to her patrons
she is mr_raskolnikov intended target and he kills her in the beginning of the book lizaveta_ivanovna katerina_ivanovna alyona handicapped innocent and submissive sister
mr_raskolnikov murders her when she walks in immediately after mr_raskolnikov had killed alyona zosimov зосимов a friend of razumikhin and doctor who cared for mr_raskolnikov
nastasya marfa_petrovna настасья петровна mr_raskolnikov landlady servant who often brings mr_raskolnikov food and drink nikodim fomich никодим фомич the amiable chief of police

nikolai dementiev николай дементьев also known as mikolka a house painter who happens to be nearby at the time of the murder and is initially suspected of the crime

a schism or split raskolnik is one who splits or dissenter the verb raskalyvat means to cleave to chop to crack to split or to break
the former translations clarify the literal meaning of the word the figurative meaning of the word is to bring to light to make to confess or acknowledge the truth etc
the word raskol is meant to evoke the ideas of the splitting of the russian orthodox church under patriarch nikon to fawn on somebody to cringe a lithuanian duke of the fifteenth century the name given to character rather by sound than by meaning perhaps named after the neoplatonic philosopher or after the russian порфира porphyra meaning purple purple mantle
the notion of intrinsic duality in crime and punishment has been commented upon with the suggestion that there is degree of symmetry to the book
edward wasiolek who has argued that dostoevsky was skilled craftsman highly conscious of the formal pattern in his art has likened the structure of crime and punishment to flattened saying the first half of the novel shows the progressive death of the first ruling principle of his character the last half the progressive birth of the new ruling principle
the novel is divided into six parts with an epilogue the point of change comes in the very middle of the novel
the recurrence of these episodes in the two halves of the novel as david bethea has argued is organized according to mirror like principle whereby the left half of the novel reflects the right half
this compositional balance is achieved by means of the symmetrical distribution of certain key episodes throughout the novel six parts the seventh part of the novel the epilogue has attracted much attention and controversy
some of dostoevsky critics have criticized the novel final pages as superfluous anti climactic unworthy of the rest of the work while others have defended it offering various schemes that they claim prove its inevitability and necessity
steven cassedy argues that crime and punishment is formally two distinct but closely related things namely particular type of tragedy in the classical greek mold and christian resurrection tale
cassedy concludes that the logical demands of the tragic model as such are satisfied without the epilogue in crime and punishment at the same time this tragedy contains christian component and the logical demands of this element are met only by the resurrection promised in the epilogue
dostoevsky letter to katkov reveals his immediate inspiration to which he remained faithful even after his original plan evolved into much more ambitious creation desire to counteract what he regarded as nefarious consequences arising from the doctrines of russian nihilism
in the novel dostoevsky pinpointed the dangers of both utilitarianism and rationalism the main ideas of which inspired the radicals continuing fierce criticism he had already started with his notes from underground
he thus attacked peculiar russian blend of french utopian socialism and benthamite utilitarianism which had led to what revolutionaries such as nikolai chernyshevsky called rational egoism
dostoevsky utilized the characters dialogue and narrative in crime and punishment to articulate an argument against westernizing ideas the radicals refused to recognize themselves in the novel pages since dostoevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences
the radicals aims were altruistic and humanitarian but they were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing the spontaneous outflow of christian compassion
dimitri pisarev ridiculed the notion that mr_raskolnikov ideas could be identified with those of the radicals of the time chernyshevsky utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in man were subject to the laws of physical science
in its latest variety russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hope of the future were to be entrusted
dostoevsky believed that such ideas limited man to product of physics chemistry and biology negating spontaneous emotional responses mr_raskolnikov exemplifies the potentially disastrous hazards contained in such an ideal
frank notes that the moral psychological traits of his character incorporate this antinomy between instinctive kindness sympathy and pity on the one hand and on the other proud and idealistic egoism that has become perverted into contemptuous disdain for the submissive herd
mr_raskolnikov inner conflict in the opening section of the novel results in utilitarian altruistic justification for the proposed crime why not kill wretched and useless old moneylender to alleviate the human misery
dostoevsky wants to show that this utilitarian style of reasoning had become widespread and commonplace it was by no means the solitary invention of mr_raskolnikov tormented and disordered mind
such radical and utilitarian ideas act to reinforce the innate egoism of mr_raskolnikov character and help justify his contempt for humanity lower qualities and ideals
he even becomes fascinated with the majestic image of napoleonic personality who in the interests of higher social good believes that he possesses moral right to kill
indeed his napoleon like plan impels him toward well calculated murder the ultimate conclusion of his self deception with utilitarianism in his depiction of petersburg dostoevsky accentuates the squalor and human wretchedness that pass before mr_raskolnikov eyes
dostoevsky believes that the moral freedom propounded by mr_raskolnikov is dreadful freedom that is contained by no values because it is before values
he uses mr_raskolnikov encounter with sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov to contrast the heartlessness of mr_raskolnikov convictions with christian approach to poverty and wretchedness in seeking to affirm this freedom in himself mr_raskolnikov is in perpetual revolt against society himself and god
he thinks that he is self sufficient and self contained but at the end his boundless self confidence must disappear in the face of what is greater than himself and his self fabricated justification must humble itself before the higher justice of god
dostoevsky calls for the regeneration and renewal of sick russian society through the re discovery of its national identity its religion and its roots
it is told primarily from the point of view of mr_raskolnikov but does at times switch to the perspective of other characters such as mr_svidrigaïlov razumikhin pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin sonya or dunya
this narrative technique which fuses the narrator very closely with the consciousness and point of view of the central characters was original for its period
frank notes that dostoevsky use of time shifts of memory and manipulation of temporal sequence begins to approach the later experiments of henry james joseph conrad virginia woolf and james joyce
crime and punishment is written from third person omniscient perspective a late nineteenth century reader was however accustomed to more orderly and linear types of expository narration
this led to the persistence of the legend that dostoevsky was an untidy and negligent craftsman and to observations like the following by melchior de vogüé
a word one does not even notice small fact that takes up only line have their reverberations fifty pages later the continuity becomes unintelligible if one skips couple of pages
dostoevsky uses different speech mannerisms and sentence of different length for different characters those who use artificial language pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin for example are identified as unattractive people
in the original russian text the names of the major characters have something of double meaning but in translation the subtlety of the russian language is predominantly lost due to differences in language structure and culture

strakhov rejected pisarev contention that the theme of environmental determinism was essential to the novel and pointed out that dostoevsky attitude towards his hero was sympathetic this is not mockery of the younger generation neither reproach nor an accusation

philosopher and orthodox theologian nikolay berdyaev shared solovyov and the symbolists sense of the novel spiritual significance seeing it as an illustration of the modern age hubristic self deification or what he calls the suicide of man by self affirmation
mr_raskolnikov answers his question of whether he has the right to kill solely by reference to his own arbitrary will but according to berdyaev these are questions that can only be answered by god and he who does not bow before that higher will destroys his neighbor and destroys himself that is the meaning of crime and punishment

an exception was the work of mikhail bakhtin considered by many commentators to be the most original and insightful analyst of dostoevsky work
in problems of dostoevsky poetics bakhtin argues that attempts to understand dostoevsky characters from the vantage point of pre existing philosophy or as individualized objects to be psychologically analysed will always fail to penetrate the unique artistic architechtonics of his works
in such cases both the critical approach and the assumed object of investigation are monological everything is perceived as occurring within the framework of single overarching perspective whether that of the critic or that of the author
dostoevsky art bakhtin argues is inherently dialogical events proceed on the basis of interaction between self validating subjective voices often within the consciousness of an individual character as is the case with mr_raskolnikov
mr_raskolnikov consciousness is depicted as battleground for all the conflicting ideas that find expression in the novel everyone and everything he encounters become reflected and refracted in dialogized interior monologue
