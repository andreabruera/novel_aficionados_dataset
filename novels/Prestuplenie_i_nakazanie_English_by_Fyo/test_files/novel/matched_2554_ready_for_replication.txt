produced by john bickers and dagny crime and punishment by fyodor dostoevsky translated by constance garnett translator preface a few words about dostoevsky himself may help the english reader to understand his work
his parents were very hard working and deeply religious people but so poor that they lived with their five #child# in only two rooms
dostoevsky was the son of a doctor the father and #mother# spent their #evening# in reading aloud to their #child# generally from books of a serious character
though always sickly and delicate dostoevsky came out third in the final examination of the petersburg school of engineering there he had already begun his first work poor folk
this #story# was published by the poet nekrassov in his review and was received with acclamations the shy unknown youth found himself instantly #something# of a celebrity
a brilliant and successful career seemed to open before him but those #hope# were soon dashed in he was arrested
though neither by #temperament# nor conviction a revolutionist dostoevsky was one of a little group of young #man# who met together to read fourier and proudhon
he was accused of taking part in conversations against the censorship of reading a letter from byelinsky to gogol and of knowing of the #intention# to set up a printing press
under nicholas i that stern and just #man# as maurice baring calls him this was enough and he was condemned to death
writing to his brother mihail dostoevsky says they snapped words over our #head# and they made us put on the white shirts worn by persons condemned to death
after eight months imprisonment he was with twenty one others taken out to the semyonovsky square to be shot thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes to suffer execution
i #thought# of you and your dear ones and i contrived to kiss plestcheiev and dourov who were next to me and to bid them farewell
suddenly the troops beat a tattoo we were unbound brought back upon the scaffold and informed that his majesty had spared us our lives
being the third in the row i concluded i had only a few minutes of life before me the #sentence# was commuted to hard labour
one of the prisoners grigoryev went mad as soon as he was untied and never regained his sanity the intense suffering of this #experience# left a lasting stamp on dostoevsky mind
though his religious #temper# led him in the #end# to accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing in his own case he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings
then followed four years of penal servitude spent in the company of common criminals in siberia where he began the dead house and some years of service in a disciplinary battalion
he had shown signs of some obscure nervous #disease# before his arrest and this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy from which he suffered for the rest of his life
he describes the awful #agony# of the condemned #man# and insists on the cruelty of inflicting such torture the #fit# occurred three or four times a year and were more frequent in periods of great strain
in he was allowed to return to russia he started a journal vremya which was forbidden by the censorship through a misunderstanding
in he lost his first wife and his brother mihail he was in terrible #poverty# yet he took upon himself the payment of his brother debts
he was weighed down by debt his brother family was dependent on him he was forced to write at heart breaking speed and is said never to have corrected his work
he started another journal the epoch which within a few months was also prohibited the later years of his life were much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife
in june he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the monument to pushkin in moscow and he was received with extraordinary demonstrations of love and honour
he was followed to the grave by a vast multitude of mourners who gave the hapless #man# the funeral of a king
in the words of a russian critic who seeks to explain the feeling inspired by dostoevsky he was one of ourselves a #man# of our blood and our bone but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than we have his insight impresses us as wisdom that wisdom of the heart which we seek that we may learn from it how to live
a few months later dostoevsky died he is still probably the most widely read writer in russia all his other gifts came to him from nature this he won for himself and
on an exceptionally hot #evening# early in july a young #man# came out of the #garret# in which he lodged in place and walked slowly as though in #hesitation# towards bridge
through it he became great crime and punishment part i chapter i he had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the #staircase#
the landlady who provided him with #garret# dinners and attendance lived on the floor below and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen the #door# of which invariably stood open
his #garret# was under the roof of a high five storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room and each time he passed the young #man# had a sick frightened feeling which made him scowl and feel ashamed
this was not because he was cowardly and abject quite the contrary but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition verging on hypochondria
he had become so completely absorbed in himself and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting not only his landlady but #anyone# at all
he was hopelessly in debt to his landlady and was afraid of meeting her he was crushed by #poverty# but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him
he had given up attending to matters of practical importance he had lost all #desire# to do so nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him
but to be stopped on the stairs to be forced to listen to her trivial irrelevant gossip to pestering demands for payment threats and complaints and to rack his brains for excuses to prevaricate to lie no rather than that he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen
this #evening# however on coming out into the #street# he became acutely aware of his fears i want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles he #thought# with an odd smile
hm yes all is in a #man# #hand# and he lets it all slip from cowardice that an axiom
it would be interesting to know what it is #man# are most afraid of taking a new #step# uttering a new word is what they fear most
but i am talking too much it because i chatter that i do nothing or perhaps it is that i chatter because i do nothing
i ve learned to chatter this last month lying for #day# together in my den thinking of jack the giant killer why am i going there now
am i capable of that is that serious it is not serious at all it simply a fantasy to amuse myself
the heat in the #street# was terrible and the airlessness the bustle and the plaster scaffolding bricks and dust all about him and that special petersburg stench so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer all worked painfully upon the young #man# already overwrought nerves
the insufferable stench from the pot houses which are particularly numerous in that part of the town and the drunken #man# whom he met continually although it was a working #day# completed the revolting #misery# of the picture
a plaything yes maybe it is a plaything an expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young #man# refined face
he was by the way exceptionally handsome above the average in height slim well built with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair
soon he sank into deep #thought# or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring to observe it
from time to time he would mutter #something# from the habit of talking to himself to which he had just confessed
at these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak for two #day# he had scarcely tasted food
he was so badly dressed that even a #man# accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the #street# in such rags
owing to the proximity of the hay market the number of establishments of bad character the preponderance of the trading and working class population crowded in these #street# and alleys in the heart of petersburg types so various were to be seen in the #street# that no figure however queer would have caused surprise
but there was such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young #man# heart that in #spite# of all the fastidiousness of youth he minded his rags least of all in the #street#
it was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students whom indeed he disliked meeting at any time
and yet when a drunken #man# who for some unknown reason was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse suddenly shouted at him as he drove past hey there german hatter bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him the young #man# stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat
it was a tall round hat from zimmerman but completely worn out rusty with age all torn and bespattered brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion
in that quarter of the town however scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise not shame however but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him
i knew it he muttered in #confusion# i #thought# so that the worst of all why a stupid thing like this the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan
yes my hat is too noticeable it looks absurd and that makes it noticeable with my rags i ought to wear a cap any sort of old pancake but not this grotesque thing
nobody wears such a hat it would be noticed a mile off it would be remembered what matters is that people would remember it and that would give them a clue
for this business one should be as little conspicuous as possible trifles trifles are what matter why it just such trifles that always ruin everything
he had not far to go he knew indeed how many #step# it was from the gate of his lodging house exactly seven hundred and thirty
at the time he had put no faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous but daring recklessness
now a month later he had begun to look upon them differently and in #spite# of the monologues in which he jeered at his own impotence and indecision he had involuntarily come to regard this hideous dream as an exploit to be attempted although he still did not realise this himself
he was positively going now for a rehearsal of his project and at every #step# his excitement grew more and more violent
with a sinking heart and a nervous tremor he went up to a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal and on the other into the #street#
this house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by working people of all #kind# tailors locksmiths cooks germans of sorts girls picking up a living as best they could petty clerks etc
he had counted them once when he had been lost in dreams there was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the two courtyards of the house
the young #man# was very glad to meet none of them and at once slipped unnoticed through the #door# on the right and up the #staircase#
it was a back #staircase# dark and narrow but he was familiar with it already and knew his way and he liked all these surroundings in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded
if i am so scared now what would it be if it somehow came to pass that i were really going to do it
three or four #door# keepers were employed on the building he could not help asking himself as he reached the fourth storey
there his progress was barred by some porters who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat he knew that the flat had been occupied by a german clerk in the civil service and his family
this german was moving out then and so the fourth floor on this #staircase# would be untenanted except by the old woman
that a good thing anyway he #thought# to himself as he rang the bell of the old woman flat the bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of copper
he had forgotten the note of that bell and now its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of #something# and to bring it clearly before him
the little flats in such houses always have bells that ring like that he started his nerves were terribly overstrained by now
in a little while the #door# was opened a tiny crack the old woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack and nothing could be seen but her little eyes glittering in the darkness
but seeing a number of people on the landing she grew bolder and opened the #door# wide the young #man# stepped into the dark entry which was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen
the old woman stood facing him in silence and looking inquiringly at him she was a diminutive withered up old woman of sixty with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp little nose
round her thin long neck which looked like a hen leg was knotted some sort of flannel rag and in #spite# of the heat there hung flapping on her shoulders a mangy fur cape yellow with age
her colourless somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared with oil and she wore no kerchief over it the old woman coughed and groaned at every instant
the young #man# must have looked at her with a rather peculiar expression for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again
$mr_raskolnikov$ a student i came here a month ago the young #man# made haste to mutter with a half bow remembering that he ought to be more polite
i remember my good sir i remember quite well your coming here the old woman said distinctly still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face
and here i am again on the same errand $mr_raskolnikov$ continued a little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman mistrust
perhaps she is always like that though only i did not notice it the other time he #thought# with an uneasy feeling
the old woman paused as though hesitating then stepped on one side and pointing to the #door# of the room she said letting her visitor pass in front of her #step# in my good sir
the little room into which the young #man# walked with yellow paper on the #wall# geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows was brightly lighted up at that moment by the setting sun
flashed as it were by chance through $mr_raskolnikov$ mind and with a rapid glance he scanned everything in the room trying as far as possible to notice and remember its arrangement
so the sun will shine like this then too but there was nothing special in the room
the furniture all very old and of yellow wood consisted of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back an oval table in front of the sofa a dressing table with a looking glass fixed on it between the windows chairs along the #wall# and two or three half penny prints in yellow frames representing german damsels with birds in their #hand# that was all
in the #corner# a light was burning before a small ikon everything was very clean the floor and the furniture were brightly polished everything shone
$lizaveta_ivanovna$ work #thought# the young #man# there was not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat
it in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such cleanliness $mr_raskolnikov$ #thought# again and he stole a curious glance at the cotton curtain over the #door# leading into another tiny room in which stood the old woman bed and chest of drawers and into which he had never looked before
the old woman said severely coming into the room and as before standing in front of him so as to look him straight in the face
i ve brought #something# to pawn here and he drew out of his #pocket# an old fashioned flat silver watch on the back of which was engraved a globe the chain was of steel
these two rooms made up the whole flat what do you want but the time is up for your last pledge
the month was up the #day# before yesterday i will bring you the interest for another month wait a little
but that for me to do as i please my good sir to wait or to sell your pledge at once
how much will you give me for the watch alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ you come with such trifles my good sir it scarcely worth anything
i gave you two #rouble# last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler for a #rouble# and a half
give me four #rouble# for it i shall redeem it it was my father i shall be getting some money soon
a #rouble# and a half and interest in advance if you like a #rouble# and a half cried the young #man#
the young #man# took it and was so angry that he was on the #point# of going away but checked himself at once remembering that there was nowhere else he could go and that he had had another object also in coming
please yourself and the old woman handed him back the watch #hand# it over he said roughly the old woman fumbled in her #pocket# for her keys and disappeared behind the curtain into the other room
the young #man# left standing alone in the middle of the room listened inquisitively thinking he could hear her unlocking the chest of drawers
it must be the top drawer he reflected so she carries the keys in a #pocket# on the right
and there one key there three times as big as all the others with deep notches that cant be the key of the chest of drawers then there must be some other chest or strong box
all in one bunch on a steel ring that worth knowing strong boxes always have keys like that but how degrading it all is
here sir as we say ten copecks the #rouble# a month so i must take fifteen copecks from a #rouble# and a half for the month in advance
the old woman came back but for the two #rouble# i lent you before you owe me now twenty copecks on the same reckoning in advance
that makes thirty five copecks altogether so i must give you a #rouble# and fifteen copecks for the watch here it is
what only a #rouble# and fifteen copecks now just so the young #man# did not dispute it and took the money
he looked at the old woman and was in no hurry to get away as though there was still #something# he wanted to say or to do but he did not himself quite know what
i may be bringing you #something# else in a #day# or two alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ a valuable thing silver a cigarette box as soon as i get it back from a #friend# he broke off in #confusion#
well we will talk about it then sir good bye are you always at home alone your sister is not here with you
he asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the passage what business is she of yours my good sir
oh nothing particular i simply asked you are too quick good #day# alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ $mr_raskolnikov$ went out in complete #confusion#
as he went down the stairs he even stopped short two or three times as though suddenly struck by some #thought#
this #confusion# became more and more intense when he was in the #street# he cried out oh god how loathsome it all is
and can i can i possibly no it nonsense it rubbish he added resolutely and how could such an atrocious thing come into my #head#
what filthy things my heart is capable of yes filthy above all disgusting loathsome loathsome and for a whole month i ve been
the feeling of intense repulsion which had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he was on his way to the old woman had by now reached such a pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to do with himself to escape from his wretchedness
he walked along the pavement like a drunken #man# regardless of the passers by and jostling against them and only came to his senses when he was in the next #street#
looking round he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern which was entered by #step# leading from the pavement to the basement
at that instant two drunken #man# came out at the #door# and abusing and supporting one another they mounted the #step#
but no words no exclamations could express his agitation without stopping to think $mr_raskolnikov$ went down the #step# at once
till that moment he had never been into a tavern but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a burning thirst
he sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty #corner# ordered some beer and eagerly drank off the first glassful
he longed for a drink of cold beer and attributed his sudden weakness to the want of food at once he felt easier and his #thought# became clear
all that nonsense he said hopefully and there is nothing in it all to worry about it simply physical derangement
just a glass of beer a piece of dry bread and in one moment the brain is stronger the mind is clearer and the will is firm
but in #spite# of this scornful reflection he was by now looking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden and he gazed round in a friendly way at the people in the room
phew how utterly petty it all is but even at that moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also not normal
besides the two drunken #man# he had met on the #step# a group consisting of about five #man# and a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time
the persons still in the tavern were a #man# who appeared to be an artisan drunk but not extremely so sitting before a pot of beer and his companion a huge stout #man# with a grey beard in a short full skirted coat
he was very drunk and had dropped asleep on the bench every now and then he began as though in his sleep cracking his fingers with his arms wide apart and the upper part of his body bounding about on the bench while he hummed some meaningless refrain trying to recall some such lines as these his wife a year he fondly loved his wife a
there were few people at the time in the tavern their departure left the room quiet and rather empty a year he fondly loved
or suddenly waking up again walking along the crowded row he met the one he used to know but no one shared his enjoyment his silent companion looked with positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations
there was another #man# in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government clerk he was sitting apart now and then sipping from his pot and looking round at the company
he too appeared to be in some agitation chapter ii $mr_raskolnikov$ was not used to crowds and as we said before
he avoided society of every sort more especially of late but now all at once he felt a #desire# to be with other people
he was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy excitement that he longed to rest if only for a moment in some other world whatever it might be and in #spite# of the filthiness of the surroundings he was glad now to stay in the tavern
the master of the establishment was in another room but he frequently came down some #step# into the main room his jaunty tarred boots with red turn over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his person
he wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat with no cravat and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an iron lock
at the counter stood a boy of about fourteen and there was another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted
on the counter lay some sliced cucumber some pieces of dried black bread and some fish chopped up small all smelling very bad
it was insufferably close and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such an atmosphere might well make a #man# drunk
#something# new seemed to be taking place within him and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company there are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the first moment before a word is spoken
such was the impression made on $mr_raskolnikov$ by the person sitting a little distance from him who looked like a retired clerk
he looked repeatedly at the clerk partly no doubt because the latter was staring persistently at him obviously anxious to enter into conversation
at the other persons in the room including the tavern keeper the clerk looked as though he were used to their company and weary of it showing a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and culture inferior to his own with whom it would be useless for him to converse
the young #man# often recalled this impression afterwards and even ascribed it to presentiment he was a #man# over fifty bald and grizzled of medium height and stoutly built
his face bloated from continual drinking was of a yellow even greenish tinge with swollen eyelids out of which keen reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks
but there was #something# very strange in him there was a light in his eyes as though of intense feeling perhaps there were even #thought# and intelligence but at the same time there was a gleam of #something# like madness
he was wearing an old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat with all its buttons missing except one and that one he had buttoned evidently clinging to this last trace of respectability
like a clerk he wore no beard nor moustache but had been so long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish brush
a crumpled shirt front covered with spots and stains protruded from his canvas waistcoat and there was #something# respectable and like an official about his manner too
but he was restless he ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his #head# drop into his #hand# dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky table
at last he looked straight at $mr_raskolnikov$ and said loudly and resolutely may i venture honoured sir to engage you in polite conversation
forasmuch as though your exterior would not command respect my #experience# admonishes me that you are a #man# of education and not accustomed to drinking
i have always respected education when in conjunction with genuine sentiments and i am besides a titular counsellor in rank $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ such is my name titular counsellor
no i am studying answered the young #man# somewhat surprised at the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly addressed
in #spite# of the momentary #desire# he had just been feeling for company of any sort on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached or attempted to approach him
i make bold to inquire have you been in the service a student then or formerly a student cried the clerk
just what i #thought# i a #man# of #experience# immense #experience# sir and he tapped his forehead with his fingers in self approval
he got up staggered took up his jug and glass and sat down beside the young #man# facing him a little sideways
you ve been a student or have attended some learned institution but allow me he was drunk but spoke fluently and boldly only occasionally losing the thread of his #sentence# and drawling his words
he pounced upon $mr_raskolnikov$ as greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month honoured sir he began almost with solemnity #poverty# is not a vice that a true saying
yet i know too that drunkenness is not a virtue and that that even truer but beggary honoured sir beggary is a vice
for beggary a #man# is not chased out of human society with a stick he is swept out with a broom so as to make it as humiliating as possible and quite right too forasmuch as in beggary
in #poverty# you may still retain your innate nobility of soul but in beggary never no one i am ready to be the first to humiliate myself
honoured sir a month ago mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ gave my wife a beating and my wife is a very different matter from me
allow me to ask you another question out of simple curiosity have you ever spent a night on a hay barge on the neva
hence the pot house do you understand no i have not happened to answered $mr_raskolnikov$ what do you mean
well i ve just come from one and it the fifth night i ve slept so he filled his glass emptied it and paused
bits of hay were in fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair it seemed quite probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five #day#
his #hand# particularly were filthy they were fat and red with black nails his conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest
the innkeeper came down from the upper room apparently on purpose to listen to the funny fellow and sat down at a little distance yawning lazily but with dignity
evidently $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ was a familiar figure here and he had most likely acquired his weakness for high flown speeches from the habit of frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in the tavern
this habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards and especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order at home
the boys at the counter fell to sniggering hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify themselves and even if possible obtain consideration
funny fellow pronounced the innkeeper and why dont you work why arent you at your duty if you are in the service
why am i not at my duty honoured sir $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ went on addressing himself exclusively to $mr_raskolnikov$ as though it had been he who put that question to him
why am i not at my duty does not my heart ache to think what a useless worm i am
a month ago when mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ beat my wife with his own #hand# and i lay drunk didnt i suffer excuse me young #man# has it ever happened to you
hm well to petition hopelessly for a loan yes it has but what do you mean by hopelessly hopelessly in the fullest sense when you know beforehand that you will get nothing by it
you know for instance beforehand with positive certainty that this #man# this most reputable and exemplary citizen will on no consideration give you money and
but mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other #day# that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself and that that what is done now in england where there is political economy
indeed i ask you why should he for he knows of course that i shant pay it back from compassion why i ask you should he give it to me
and yet though i know beforehand that he wont i set off to him and why do you go put in $mr_raskolnikov$
well when one has no one nowhere else one can go for every #man# must have somewhere to go since there are times when one absolutely must go somewhere
when my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket then i had to go for my daughter has a yellow passport he added in parenthesis looking with a certain uneasiness at the young #man#
he went on hurriedly and with apparent composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled no matter i am not confounded by the wagging of their #head# for everyone knows everything about it already and all that is secret is made open
no matter sir no matter and i accept it all not with contempt but with humility so be it
so be it behold the #man# excuse me young #man# can you no to put it more strongly and more distinctly not
can you but dare you looking upon me assert that i am not a pig the young #man# did not answer a word
well the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside
i have the semblance of a beast but $katerina_ivanovna$ my spouse is a person of education and an officer daughter
granted granted i am a scoundrel but she is a woman of a noble heart full of sentiments refined by education
well so be it i am a pig but she is a lady and yet oh if only she felt for me
honoured sir honoured sir you know every #man# ought to have at least one place where people feel for him but $katerina_ivanovna$ though she is magnanimous she is unjust
and yet although i realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity for i repeat without being ashamed she pulls my hair young #man# he declared with redoubled dignity hearing the sniggering again but my god if she would but once
for more than once my wish did come true and more than once she has felt for me but such is my fate and i am a beast by nature
but no no it all in vain and it no use talking no use talking rather assented the innkeeper yawning $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ struck his fist resolutely on the table
not her shoes that would be more or less in the order of things but her stockings her stockings i have sold for drink
her mohair shawl i sold for drink a present to her long ago her own property not mine and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too
we have three little #child# and $katerina_ivanovna$ is at work from morning till night she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the #child# for she been used to cleanliness from a #child#
such is my fate do you know sir do you know i have sold her very stockings for drink but her chest is weak and she has a tendency to consumption
and i feel it do you suppose i dont feel it and the more i drink the more i feel it
that why i drink too i try to find sympathy and feeling in drink i drink so that i may suffer twice as much
and as though in despair he laid his #head# down on the table young #man# he went on raising his #head# again in your face i seem to read some trouble of mind
for in unfolding to you the #story# of my life i do not wish to make myself a laughing stock before these idle listeners who indeed know all about it already but i am looking for a #man# of feeling and education
know then that my wife was educated in a high class school for the daughters of noblemen and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit
when you came in i read it and that was why i addressed you at once the medal well the medal of course was sold long ago hm
and although she is most continually on bad terms with the landlady yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past honours and of the happy #day# that are gone
but the certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed it to our landlady i dont condemn her for it i dont blame her for the one thing left her
is recollection of the past and all the rest is dust and ashes yes yes she is a lady of spirit proud and determined
she scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat but wont allow herself to be treated with disrespect
that why she would not overlook mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ rudeness to her and so when he gave her a beating for it she took to her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows
she was a widow when i married her with three #child# one smaller than the other she married her first husband an infantry officer for love and ran away with him from her father house
she was exceedingly fond of her husband but he gave way to cards got into trouble and with that he died
he used to beat her at the #end# and although she paid him back of which i have authentic documentary evidence to this #day# she speaks of him with tears and she throws him up to me and i am glad
and she was left at his death with three #child# in a wild and remote district where i happened to be at the time and she was left in such hopeless #poverty# that although i have seen many ups and downs of all sort i dont feel equal to describing it even
i am glad that though only in imagination she should think of herself as having once been happy her relations had all thrown her off
and then honoured sir and then i being at the time a widower with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife offered her my #hand# for i could not bear the sight of such suffering
you can judge the extremity of her calamities that she a woman of education and culture and distinguished family should have consented to be my wife
and she was proud too excessively proud but she did weeping and sobbing and wringing her #hand# she married me for she had nowhere to turn
do you understand sir do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn no that you dont understand yet
and for a whole year i performed my duties conscientiously and faithfully and did not touch this he tapped the jug with his finger for i have feelings
but even so i could not please her and then i lost my place too and that through no fault of mine but through changes in the office and then i did touch it
it will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent capital adorned with innumerable monuments
here i obtained a situation i obtained it and i lost it again do you understand this time it was through my own fault
we have now part of a room at amalia fyodorovna lippevechsel and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with i could not say
i lost it for my weakness had come out there are a lot of people living there besides ourselves dirt and disorder a perfect bedlam
and meanwhile my daughter by my first wife has grown up and what my daughter has had to put up with from her #step# #mother# whilst she was growing up i wont speak of
hm yes for though $katerina_ivanovna$ is full of generous feelings she is a spirited lady irritable and short tempered yes but it no use going over that
i did make an effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal history but as i was not very well up in those subjects myself and we had no suitable books and what books we had
$sonia$ as you may well fancy has had no education hm anyway we have not even those now so all our instruction came to an #end#
since she has attained years of maturity she has read other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great interest a book she got through mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ lewes physiology
we stopped at cyrus of persia do you know it and even recounted extracts from it to us and that the whole of her education
and now may i venture to address you honoured sir on my own account with a private question do you suppose that a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work
not fifteen farthings a #day# can she earn if she is respectable and has no special talent and that without putting her work down for an instant
and what more ivan ivanitch klopstock the civil counsellor have you heard of him has not to this #day# paid her for the half dozen linen shirts she made him and drove her roughly away stamping and reviling her on the pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were put in askew
and $katerina_ivanovna$ walking up and down and wringing her #hand# her cheeks flushed red as they always are in that #disease# here you live with us says she you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help
and much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little ones for three #day#
and there are the little ones hungry i was lying at the time well what of it i was lying drunk
and i heard my $sonia$ speaking she is a gentle creature with a soft little voice fair hair and such a pale thin little face
and darya frantsovna a woman of evil character and very well known to the police had two or three times tried to get at her through the landlady
she said $katerina_ivanovna$ am i really to do a thing like that and why not said $katerina_ivanovna$ with a jeer you are #something# mighty precious to be so careful of
she was not herself when she spoke but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry #child# and it was said more to wound her than anything else
but dont blame her dont blame her honoured sir dont blame her for that $katerina_ivanovna$ character and when #child# cry even from hunger she falls to beating them at once
at six clock i saw $sonia$ get up put on her kerchief and her cape and go out of the room and about nine clock she came back
she did not utter a word she did not even look at her she simply picked up our big green drap de dames shawl we have a shawl made of drap de dames put it over her #head# and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the #wall# only her little shoulders and her body kept shuddering
she walked straight up to $katerina_ivanovna$ and she laid thirty #rouble# on the table before her in silence and i went on lying there just as before
and then i saw young #man# i saw $katerina_ivanovna$ in the same silence go up to $sonia$ little bed she was on her knees all the #evening# kissing $sonia$ feet and would not get up and then they both fell asleep in each other arms together together
yes and i lay drunk $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ stopped short as though his voice had failed him then he hurriedly filled his glass drank and cleared his throat
since then sir he went on after a brief pause since then owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by evil intentioned persons in all which darya frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of respect since then my daughter $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ has been forced to take a yellow ticket and owing to that she is unable to go on living with us
for our landlady amalia fyodorovna would not hear of it though she had backed up darya frantsovna before and mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ too
hm all the trouble between him and $katerina_ivanovna$ was on $sonia$ account at first he was for making up to $sonia$ himself
and then all of a sudden he stood on his dignity how said he can a highly educated #man# like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that
and $katerina_ivanovna$ would not let it pass she stood up for her and so that how it happened and $sonia$ comes to us now mostly after dark she comforts $katerina_ivanovna$ and gives her all she can
she has a room at the kapernaumovs the tailors she lodges with them kapernaumov is a lame #man# with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft palates too
and his wife too has a cleft palate they all live in one room but $sonia$ has her own partitioned off
then i got up in the morning and put on my rags lifted up my #hand# to heaven and set off to his excellency ivan afanasyvitch
hm yes very poor people and all with cleft palates yes his excellency ivan afanasyvitch do you know him no well then it a #man# of god you dont know
he is wax wax before the face of the lord even as wax melteth his eyes were dim when he heard my #story#
$sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ once already you have deceived my expectations i ll take you once more on my own responsibility that what he said remember he said
i kissed the dust at his feet in #thought# only for in reality he would not have allowed me to do it being a statesman and a #man# of modern political and enlightened ideas
i returned home and when i announced that i been taken back into the service and should receive a salary heavens what a to do there was
at that moment a whole party of revellers already drunk came in from the #street# and the sounds of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a #child# of seven singing
and now you can go $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ stopped again in violent excitement the hamlet were heard in the entry the room was filled with noise
the tavern keeper and the boys were busy with the new comers $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his #story#
he appeared by now to be extremely weak but as he became more and more drunk he became more and more talkative
the recollection of his recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him and was positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face
as soon as $katerina_ivanovna$ and $sonia$ heard of it mercy on us it was as though i stepped into the kingdom of heaven
$mr_raskolnikov$ listened attentively that was five weeks ago sir yes it used to be you can lie like a beast nothing but abuse
now they were walking on tiptoe hushing the #child# $semyon_zaharovitch$ is tired with his work at the office he is resting shh
they made me coffee before i went to work and boiled cream for me they began to get real cream for me do you hear that
and how they managed to get together the money for a decent outfit eleven #rouble# fifty copecks i cant guess boots cotton shirt fronts most magnificent a uniform they got up all in splendid style for eleven #rouble# and a half
the first morning i came back from the office i found $katerina_ivanovna$ had cooked two courses for dinner soup and salt meat with horse radish which we had never dreamed of till then
none at all but she got herself up as though she were going on a visit and not that she anything to do it with she smartened herself up with nothing at all she done her hair nicely put on a clean collar of some sort cuffs and there she was quite a different person
$sonia$ my little darling had only helped with money for the time she said it wont do for me to come and see you too often
she had not any dresses she was younger and better looking after dark maybe when no one can see do you hear do you hear
i lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think though $katerina_ivanovna$ had quarrelled to the last degree with our landlady amalia fyodorovna only a week before she could not resist then asking her in to coffee
$semyon_zaharovitch$ is in the service again now and receiving a salary says she and he went himself to his excellency and his excellency himself came out to him made all the others wait and led $semyon_zaharovitch$ by the #hand# before everybody into his study
to be sure says he $semyon_zaharovitch$ remembering your past services says he and in #spite# of your propensity to that foolish weakness since you promise now and since moreover we ve got on badly without you do you hear do you hear and so
for two hours they were sitting whispering together do you hear do you hear says he i rely now on your word as a gentleman
and all that let me tell you she has simply made up for herself and not simply out of wantonness for the sake of bragging no she believes it all herself she amuses herself with her own fancies upon my word she does
six #day# ago when i brought her my first earnings in full twenty three #rouble# forty copecks altogether she called me her poppet poppet said she my little poppet
and i dont blame her for it no i dont blame her and when we were by ourselves you understand you would not think me a beauty you would not think much of me as a husband would you
well she pinched my cheek my little poppet said she $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ broke off tried to smile but suddenly his chin began to twitch
the tavern the degraded appearance of the #man# the five nights in the hay barge and the pot of spirits and yet this poignant love for his wife and #child# bewildered his listener
he controlled himself however $mr_raskolnikov$ listened intently but with a sick sensation he felt vexed that he had come here honoured sir honoured sir cried $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ recovering himself oh sir
perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you as it does to others and perhaps i am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the trivial details of my home life but it is not a laughing matter to me
and the whole of that heavenly #day# of my life and the whole of that #evening# i passed in fleeting dreams of how i would arrange it all and how i would dress all the #child# and how i should give her rest and how i should rescue my own daughter from dishonour and restore her to the bosom of her family
for i can feel it all and a great deal more quite excusable sir well then sir $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ suddenly gave a sort of start raised his #head# and gazed intently at his listener
well on the very next #day# after all those dreams that is to say exactly five #day# ago in the #evening# by a cunning trick like a thief in the night i stole from $katerina_ivanovna$ the key of her box took out what was left of my earnings how much it was i have forgotten and now look at me all of you
it the fifth #day# since i left home and they are looking for me there and it the #end# of my employment and my uniform is lying in a tavern on the egyptian bridge
$sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ struck his forehead with his fist clenched his teeth closed his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table
but a minute later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and affectation of bravado he glanced at $mr_raskolnikov$ laughed and said this morning i went to see $sonia$
i exchanged it for the garments i have on and it the #end# of everything i went to ask her for a pick me up
he he he you dont say she gave it to you cried one of the new comers he shouted the words and went off into a guffaw
this very quart was bought with her money $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ declared addressing himself exclusively to $mr_raskolnikov$ thirty copecks she gave me with her own #hand# her last all she had as i saw
not on earth but up yonder they grieve over #man# they weep but they dont blame them they dont blame them
she said nothing she only looked at me without a word but it hurts more it hurts more when they dont blame
thirty copecks yes and maybe she needs them now eh what do you think my dear sir for now she got to keep up her appearance
you see she must have things petticoats starched ones shoes too real jaunty ones to show off her foot when she has to #step# over a puddle
it costs money that smartness that special smartness you know do you understand and there pomatum too do you understand sir do you understand what all that smartness means
and here i her own father here i took thirty copecks of that money for a drink and i am drinking it
and i have already drunk it come who will have pity on a #man# like me eh are you sorry for me sir or not
tell me sir are you sorry or not he he he he would have filled his glass but there was no drink left
the pot was empty what are you to be pitied for shouted the tavern keeper who was again near them shouts of laughter and even oaths followed
the laughter and the oaths came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged government clerk
to be pitied why am i to be pitied $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ suddenly declaimed standing up with his arm outstretched as though he had been only waiting for that question
why am i to be pitied you say yes there nothing to pity me for i ought to be crucified crucified on a cross not pitied
crucify me oh judge crucify me but pity me and then i will go of myself to be crucified for it not merry making i seek but
it was tribulation i sought at the bottom of it tears and tribulation and have found it and i have tasted it but he will pity us
who has had pity on all #man# who has understood all #man# and all things he is the one he too is the judge
he will come in that #day# and he will ask where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross consumptive #step# #mother# and for the little #child# of another
tears and tribulation do you suppose you that sell that this pint of yours has been sweet to me where is the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard her earthly father undismayed by his beastliness
and he will say come to me i have already forgiven thee once i have forgiven thee once thy sins which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much
and he will forgive my $sonia$ he will forgive i know it i felt it in my heart when i was with her just now
and he will judge and will forgive all the good and the evil the wise and the meek and when he has done with all of them then he will summon us
you too come forth he will say come forth ye drunkards come forth ye weak ones come forth ye #child# of shame
and he will say unto us ye are swine made in the image of the beast and with his mark but come ye also
and we shall all come forth without shame and shall stand before him and the wise ones and those of understanding will say oh lord why dost thou receive these #man#
and he will say this is why i receive them oh ye wise this is why i receive them oh ye of understanding that not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this
and he will hold out his #hand# to us and we shall fall down before him and we shall weep and we shall understand all things
and he sank down on the bench exhausted and helpless looking at no one apparently oblivious of his surroundings and plunged in deep #thought#
his words had created a certain impression there was a moment of silence but soon laughter and oaths were heard again
then we shall understand all and all will understand $katerina_ivanovna$ even she will understand lord thy kingdom come
that his notion talked himself silly a fine clerk he is and so on and so on let us go sir said $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ all at once raising his #head# and addressing $mr_raskolnikov$ come along with me
kozel house looking into the yard i going to $katerina_ivanovna$ time i did $mr_raskolnikov$ had for some time been wanting to go
and he had meant to help him $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech and leaned heavily on the young #man#
they had two or three hundred paces to go the drunken #man# was more and more overcome by dismay and #confusion# as they drew nearer the house
it not $katerina_ivanovna$ i am afraid of now he muttered in agitation and that she will begin pulling my hair
what does my hair matter bother my hair that what i say indeed it will be better if she does begin pulling it that not what i am afraid of
it her eyes i am afraid of yes her eyes the red on her cheeks too frightens me and her breathing too
have you noticed how people in that #disease# breathe when they are excited i am frightened of the #child# crying too
for if $sonia$ has not taken them food i dont know what happened i dont know but blows i am not afraid of
know sir that such blows are not a pain to me but even an enjoyment in fact i cant get on without it
it better so let her strike me it relieves her heart it better so there is the house the house of kozel the cabinet maker a german well to do
lead the way they went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey the #staircase# got darker and darker as they went up
it was nearly eleven clock and although in summer in petersburg there is no real night yet it was quite dark at the top of the stairs
a very poor looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle #end# the whole of it was visible from the entrance
a grimy little #door# at the very top of the stairs stood ajar it was all in disorder littered up with rags of all sorts especially #child# garments
there was nothing in the room except two chairs and a sofa covered with american leather full of holes before which stood an old deal kitchen table unpainted and uncovered
across the furthest #corner# was stretched a ragged sheet behind it probably was the bed at the edge of the table stood a smoldering tallow candle in an iron candlestick
it appeared that the family had a room to themselves not part of a room but their room was practically a passage
the #door# leading to the other rooms or rather cupboards into which amalia lippevechsel flat was divided stood half open and there was shouting uproar and laughter within
people seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there words of the most unceremonious #kind# flew out from time to time
she was a rather tall slim and graceful woman terribly emaciated with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks
she was pacing up and down in her little room pressing her #hand# against her chest her lips were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps
and that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the candle #end# playing upon it made a sickening impression
$mr_raskolnikov$ recognised $katerina_ivanovna$ at once her eyes glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare she seemed to $mr_raskolnikov$ about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$
she had not heard them and did not notice them coming in she seemed to be lost in #thought# hearing and seeing nothing
the room was close but she had not opened the window a stench rose from the #staircase# but the #door# on to the stairs was not closed
the youngest #child# a girl of six was asleep sitting curled up on the floor with her #head# on the sofa
from the inner rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in she kept coughing but did not close the #door# a boy a year older stood crying and shaking in the #corner# probably he had just had a beating
beside him stood a girl of nine years old tall and thin wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung over her bare shoulders long outgrown and barely reaching her knees
she was trying to comfort him whispering #something# to him and doing all she could to keep him from whimpering again
at the same time her large dark eyes which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened face were watching her #mother# with alarm
$sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ did not enter the #door# but dropped on his knees in the very doorway pushing $mr_raskolnikov$ in front of him
the woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he had come for
but evidently she decided that he was going into the next room as he had to pass through hers to get there
taking no further notice of him she walked towards the outer #door# to close it and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the doorway
her arm as thin as a stick was round her brother neck ah she cried out in a frenzy he has come back
the criminal the monster and where is the money what in your #pocket# show me and your clothes are all different
where are your clothes where is the money speak and she fell to searching him $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ submissively and obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search
not a farthing was there where is the money she cried mercy on us can he have drunk it all
there were twelve silver #rouble# left in the chest and in a fury she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room
this does not hurt me but is a positive con so la tion ho nou red sir he called out shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead
$sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees and this is a consolation to me the #child# asleep on the floor woke up and began to cry
the boy in the #corner# losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed to his sister in violent terror almost in a #fit#
the eldest girl was shaking like a leaf he drunk it he drunk it all the poor woman screamed in despair and his clothes are gone
and they are hungry hungry and wringing her #hand# she pointed to the #child# oh accursed life and you are you not ashamed she pounced all at once upon $mr_raskolnikov$ from the tavern
have you been drinking with him you have been drinking with him too go away the young #man# was hastening away without uttering a word
the inner #door# was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it coarse laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and #head# wearing caps thrust themselves in at the doorway
further in could be seen figures in dressing gowns flung open in costumes of unseemly scantiness some of them with cards in their #hand#
they even began to come into the room at last a sinister shrill outcry was heard this came from amalia lippevechsel herself pushing her way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next #day#
as he went out $mr_raskolnikov$ had time to put his #hand# into his #pocket# to snatch up the coppers he had received in exchange for his #rouble# in the tavern and to lay them unnoticed on the window
they were particularly diverted when $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ dragged about by his hair shouted that it was a consolation to him afterwards on the stairs he changed his mind and would have gone back
but reflecting that it would be impossible to take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it he dismissed it with a wave of his #hand# and went back to his lodging
what a stupid thing i ve done he #thought# to himself they have $sonia$ and i want it myself
and maybe $sonia$ herself will be bankrupt to #day# for there is always a risk hunting big game digging for gold then they would all be without a crust to morrow except for my money
$sonia$ wants pomatum too he said as he walked along the #street# and he laughed malignantly such smartness costs money hm hurrah for $sonia$
what a mine they ve dug there and they re making the most of it yes they are making the most of it
they ve wept over it and grown used to it #man# grows used to everything the scoundrel he sank into #thought#
what if #man# is not really a scoundrel #man# in general i mean the whole race of mankind then all the rest is prejudice simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers
and what if i am wrong he cried suddenly after a moment #thought# and it all as it should be
chapter iii he waked up late next #day# after a broken sleep but his sleep had not refreshed him he waked up bilious irritable ill tempered and looked with hatred at his room
it had a #poverty# stricken appearance with its dusty yellow paper peeling off the #wall# and it was so low pitched that a #man# of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment that he would knock his #head# against the ceiling
the furniture was in keeping with the room there were three old chairs rather rickety a painted table in the #corner# on which lay a few manuscripts and books the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long untouched
a big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one #wall# and half the floor space of the room it was once covered with chintz but was now in rags and served $mr_raskolnikov$ as a bed
often he went to sleep on it as he was without undressing without sheets wrapped in his old student overcoat with his #head# on one little pillow under which he heaped up all the linen he had clean and dirty by way of a bolster
it was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length a little table stood in front of the sofa
it would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder but to $mr_raskolnikov$ in his present state of mind
he had got completely away from everyone like a tortoise in its shell and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation
his landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him in meals and he had not yet #thought# of expostulating with her though he went without his dinner
$nastasya$ the cook and only servant was rather pleased at the lodger mood and had entirely given up sweeping and doing his room only once a week or so she would stray into his room with a broom
this was positively agreeable he was in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated upon one thing she waked him up that #day#
get up why are you asleep she called to him it past nine i have brought you some tea will you have a cup
i should think you re fairly starving $mr_raskolnikov$ opened his eyes started and recognised $nastasya$ from the landlady eh he asked slowly and with a sickly face sitting up on the sofa
she set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it
here $nastasya$ take it please he said fumbling in his #pocket# for he had slept in his clothes and taking out a handful of coppers run and buy me a loaf
from the landlady indeed and get me a little sausage the cheapest at the pork butcher the loaf i ll fetch you this very minute but wouldnt you rather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage
when the soup had been brought and he had begun upon it $nastasya$ sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting
it capital soup yesterday i saved it for you yesterday but you came in late it fine soup she was a country peasant woman and a very talkative one
praskovya pavlovna means to complain to the police about you she said he scowled to the police what does she want
you dont pay her money and you wont turn out of the room that what she wants to be sure
the devil that the last straw he muttered grinding his teeth no that would not suit me just now she is a fool he added aloud
but why if you are so clever do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it
i ll go and talk to her to #day# fool she is and no mistake just as i am one time you used to go out you say to teach #child#
but why is it you do nothing now i am doing $mr_raskolnikov$ began sullenly and reluctantly what are you doing
work what sort of work i am thinking he answered seriously after a pause $nastasya$ was overcome with a #fit# of laughter
she was given to laughter and when anything amused her she laughed inaudibly quivering and shaking all over till she felt ill
and have you made much money by your thinking she managed to articulate at last one cant go out to give lessons without boots
and i sick of it dont quarrel with your bread and butter they pay so little for lessons what the use of a few coppers
he answered reluctantly as though replying to his own #thought# and you want to get a fortune all at once
he looked at her strangely yes i want a fortune he answered firmly after a brief pause dont be in such a hurry you quite frighten me
shall i get you the loaf or not as you please ah i forgot a letter came for you yesterday when you were out
a letter for me from whom i cant say i gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it
will you pay me back then bring it to me for god sake bring it cried $mr_raskolnikov$ greatly excited good god a minute later the letter was brought him
that was it from his #mother# from the province of he turned pale when he took it it was a long while since he had received a letter but another feeling also suddenly stabbed his heart
$nastasya$ leave me alone for goodness sake here are your three copecks but for goodness sake make haste and go
the letter was quivering in his #hand# he did not want to open it in her presence he wanted to be left alone with this letter
when $nastasya$ had gone out he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it then he gazed intently at the address the small sloping handwriting so dear and familiar of the #mother# who had once taught him to read and write
at last he opened it it was a thick heavy letter weighing over two ounces two large sheets of note paper were covered with very small handwriting
my dear $rodya$ wrote his #mother# it two months since i last had a talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me awake at night thinking
he delayed he seemed almost afraid of #something# but i am sure you will not blame me for my inevitable silence
you know how i love you you are all we have to look to $dounia$ and i you are our all our one #hope#
what a grief it was to me when i heard that you had given up the university some months ago for want of means to keep yourself and that you had lost your lessons and your other work
our one stay how could i help you out of my hundred and twenty #rouble# a year pension the fifteen #rouble# i sent you four months ago
i borrowed as you know on security of my pension from vassily ivanovitch vahrushin a merchant of this town he is a #kind# hearted #man# and was a #friend# of your father too
but having given him the right to receive the pension i had to wait till the debt was paid off and that is only just done so that i ve been unable to send you anything all this time
but now thank god i believe i shall be able to send you #something# more and in fact we may congratulate ourselves on our good fortune now of which i hasten to inform you
in the first place would you have guessed dear $rodya$ that your sister has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be separated in the future
thank god her sufferings are over but i will tell you everything in order so that you may know just how everything has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you
when you wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that $dounia$ had a great deal to put up with in the svidrigraïlovs house when you wrote that and asked me to tell you all about it what could i write in answer to you
if i had written the whole truth to you i dare say you would have thrown up everything and have come to us even if you had to walk all the way
for i know your character and your feelings and you would not let your sister be insulted i was in despair myself but what could i do
what made it all so difficult was that $dounia$ received a hundred #rouble# in advance when she took the place as governess in their family on condition of part of her salary being deducted every month and so it was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt
and besides i did not know the whole truth myself then this sum now i can explain it all to you my precious $rodya$
she took chiefly in order to send you sixty #rouble# which you needed so terribly then and which you received from us last year
we deceived you then writing that this money came from $dounia$ savings but that was not so and now i tell you all about it because thank god things have suddenly changed for the better and that you may know how $dounia$ loves you and what a heart she has
but i dont want to go into all those painful details so as not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over
in short in #spite# of the #kind# and generous behaviour of $marfa_petrovna$ $mr_svidrigaïlov$ wife and all the rest of the household $dounia$ had a very hard time especially when $mr_svidrigaïlov$ relapsing into his old regimental habits was under the influence of bacchus
at first indeed $mr_svidrigaïlov$ treated her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at table and how do you think it was all explained later on
would you believe that the crazy fellow had conceived a passion for $dounia$ from the beginning but had concealed it under a show of rudeness and contempt
possibly he was ashamed and horrified himself at his own flighty #hope# considering his years and his being the father of a family and that made him angry with $dounia$
but at last he lost all control and had the face to make $dounia$ an open and shameful proposal promising her all sorts of inducements and offering besides to throw up everything and take her to another estate of his or even abroad
and possibly too he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide the truth from others you can imagine all she went through
to leave her situation at once was impossible not only on account of the money debt but also to spare the feelings of $marfa_petrovna$ whose suspicions would have been aroused and then $dounia$ would have been the cause of a rupture in the family
there were various other reasons owing to which $dounia$ could not #hope# to escape from that awful house for another six weeks
and it would have meant a terrible scandal for $dounia$ too that would have been inevitable you know $dounia$ of course you know how clever she is and what a strong will she has
$dounia$ can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness
she did not even write to me about everything for fear of upsetting me although we were constantly in communication it all ended very unexpectedly
$marfa_petrovna$ accidentally overheard her husband imploring $dounia$ in the garden and putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position threw the blame upon her believing her to be the cause of it all
an awful scene took place between them on the spot in the garden $marfa_petrovna$ went so far as to strike $dounia$ refused to hear anything and was shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that $dounia$ should be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant cart into which they flung all her things her linen and her clothes all pell mell without folding it up and packing it
and a heavy shower of rain came on too and $dounia$ insulted and put to shame had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen versts into town
only think now what answer could i have sent to the letter i received from you two months ago and what could i have written
i was in despair i dared not write to you the truth because you would have been very unhappy mortified and indignant and yet what could you do
you could only perhaps ruin yourself and besides $dounia$ would not allow it and fill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow i could not
for a whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal and it came to such a pass that $dounia$ and i dared not even go to church on account of the contemptuous looks whispers and even remarks made aloud about us
all our acquaintances avoided us nobody even bowed to us in the #street# and i learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to insult us in a shameful way smearing the gates of our house with pitch so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave
all this was set going by $marfa_petrovna$ who managed to slander $dounia$ and throw dirt at her in every family
she knows everyone in the neighbourhood and that month she was continually coming into the town and as she is rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband which is not at all right
so in a short time she had spread her #story# not only in the town but over the whole surrounding district
it made me ill but $dounia$ bore it better than i did and if only you could have seen how she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up
but by god mercy our sufferings were cut short $mr_svidrigaïlov$ returned to his senses and repented and probably feeling sorry for $dounia$ he laid before $marfa_petrovna$ a complete and unmistakable proof of $dounia$ innocence in the form of a letter $dounia$ had been forced to write and give to him before $marfa_petrovna$ came upon them in the garden
this letter which remained in $mr_svidrigaïlov$ #hand# after her departure she had written to refuse personal explanations and secret interviews for which he was entreating her
in that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to $marfa_petrovna$ reminding him that he was the father and #head# of a family and telling him how infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl unhappy enough already
indeed dear $rodya$ the letter was so nobly and touchingly written that i sobbed when i read it and to this #day# i cannot read it without tears
moreover the evidence of the servants too cleared $dounia$ reputation they had seen and known a great deal more than $mr_svidrigaïlov$ had himself supposed as indeed is always the case with servants
$marfa_petrovna$ was completely taken aback and again crushed as she said herself to us but she was completely convinced of $dounia$ innocence
the very next #day# being sunday she went straight to the cathedral knelt down and prayed with tears to our lady to give her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty
then she came straight from the cathedral to us told us the whole #story# wept bitterly and fully penitent she embraced $dounia$ and besought her to forgive her
the same morning without any delay she went round to all the houses in the town and everywhere shedding tears she asserted in the most flattering terms $dounia$ innocence and the nobility of her feelings and her behavior
what was more she showed and read to everyone the letter in $dounia$ own handwriting to $mr_svidrigaïlov$ and even allowed them to take copies of it which i must say i think was superfluous
in this way she was busy for several #day# in driving about the whole town because some people had taken offence through precedence having been given to others
and therefore they had to take turns so that in every house she was expected before she arrived and everyone knew that on such and such a #day# $marfa_petrovna$ would be reading the letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading of it even many who had heard it several times already both in their own houses and in other people
she is an angel in my opinion a great deal a very great deal of all this was unnecessary but that $marfa_petrovna$ character
anyway she succeeded in completely re establishing $dounia$ reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace upon her husband as the only person to blame so that i really began to feel sorry for him it was really treating the crazy fellow too harshly
all of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which one may say our whole fortunes are now transformed
$dounia$ was at once asked to give lessons in several families but she refused you must know dear $rodya$ that $dounia$ has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry him
i hasten to tell you all about the matter and though it has been arranged without asking your consent i think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you
he is already of the rank of a counsellor $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and is distantly related to $marfa_petrovna$ who has been very active in bringing the match about
and you could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot this was how it happened it began with his expressing through her his #desire# to make our acquaintance
he was properly received drank coffee with us and the very next #day# he sent us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a speedy and decided answer
he is a very busy #man# and is in a great hurry to get to petersburg so that every moment is precious to him
at first of course we were greatly surprised as it had all happened so quickly and unexpectedly we #thought# and talked it over the whole #day#
he is a well to do #man# to be depended upon he has two posts in the government and has already made his fortune
it is true that he is forty five years old but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be #thought# attractive by women and he is altogether a very respectable and presentable #man# only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited
and beware dear $rodya$ when he comes to petersburg as he shortly will do beware of judging him too hastily and severely as your way is if there is anything you do not like in him at first sight
but possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight i give you this warning although i feel sure that he will make a favourable impression upon you
moreover in order to understand any #man# one must be deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards
at his first visit indeed he told us that he was a practical #man# but still he shares as he expressed it many of the convictions of our most rising generation and he is an opponent of all prejudices
he said a good deal more for he seems a little conceited and likes to be listened to but this is scarcely a vice
i of course understood very little of it but $dounia$ explained to me that though he is not a #man# of great education he is clever and seems to be good natured
and $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ judging by many indications is a thoroughly estimable #man# you know your sister character $rodya$ she is a resolute sensible patient and generous girl but she has a passionate heart as i know very well
of course there is no great love either on his side or on hers but $dounia$ is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel and will make it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her happiness his care
of that we have no good reason to doubt though it must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste
besides he is a #man# of great prudence and he will see to be sure of himself that his own happiness will be the more secure the happier $dounia$ is with him
and as for some defects of character for some habits and even certain differences of opinion which indeed are inevitable even in the happiest marriages $dounia$ has said that as regards all that
she relies on herself that there is nothing to be uneasy about and that she is ready to put up with a great deal if only their future relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one
he struck me for instance at first as rather abrupt but that may well come from his being an outspoken #man# and that is no doubt how it is
for instance at his second visit after he had received $dounia$ consent in the course of conversation he declared that before making $dounia$ acquaintance he had made up his mind to marry a girl of good reputation without dowry and above all one who had experienced #poverty# because as he explained a #man# ought not to be indebted to his wife but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her benefactor
i must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely than i have done for i have forgotten his actual phrases and only remember the meaning
and besides it was obviously not said of design but slipped out in the heat of conversation so that he tried afterwards to correct himself and smooth it over but all the same it did strike me as somewhat rude and i said so afterwards to $dounia$
$dounia$ did not sleep all night before she made up her mind and thinking that i was asleep she got out of bed and was walking up and down the room all night at last she knelt down before the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me that she had decided
i have mentioned already that $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ is just setting off for petersburg where he has a great deal of business and he wants to open a legal bureau
he has been occupied for many years in conducting civil and commercial litigation and only the other #day# he won an important case
but $dounia$ was vexed and answered that words are not deeds and that of course is perfectly true he has to be in petersburg because he has an important case before the senate
so $rodya$ dear he may be of the greatest use to you in every way indeed and $dounia$ and i have agreed that from this very #day# you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that your future is marked out and assured for you
oh if only this comes to pass this would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a providential blessing
$dounia$ is dreaming of nothing else we have even ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
he was cautious in his answer and said that of course as he could not get on without a secretary it would be better to be paying a salary to a relation than to a stranger if only the former were fitted for the duties as though there could be doubt of your being fitted
but then he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave you time for work at his office the matter dropped for the time but $dounia$ is thinking of nothing else now
she has been in a sort of fever for the last few #day# and has already made a regular plan for your becoming in the #end# an associate and even a partner in $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ business which might well be seeing that you are a student of law
i am in complete agreement with her $rodya$ and share all her plans and #hope# and think there is every probability of realising them
and in #spite# of $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ evasiveness very natural at present since he does not know you $dounia$ is firmly persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her future husband this she is reckoning upon
of course we are careful not to talk of any of these more remote plans to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ especially of your becoming his partner
nor has either $dounia$ or i breathed a word to him of the great #hope# we have of his helping us to pay for your university studies we have not spoken of it in the first place because it will come to pass of itself later on and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of himself as though he could refuse $dounia$ that the more readily since you may by your own efforts become his right #hand# in the office and receive this assistance not as a charity but as a salary earned by your own work
he is a practical #man# and might take this very coldly it might all seem to him simply a #day# dream $dounia$ wants to arrange it all like this
and we have not spoken of our plans for another reason that is because i particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when you first meet him
when $dounia$ spoke to him with enthusiasm about you he answered that one could never judge of a #man# without seeing him close for oneself and that he looked forward to forming his own opinion when he makes your acquaintance
i think that perhaps for some reasons nothing to do with $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ though simply for my own personal perhaps old womanish fancies
and i quite agree with her do you know my precious $rodya$ i should do better to go on living by myself apart than with them after the wedding
i am convinced that he will be generous and delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter for the future and if he has said nothing about it hitherto it is simply because it has been taken for granted but i shall refuse
i have noticed more than once in my life that husbands dont quite get on with their #mother# in law and i dont want to be the least bit in #anyone# way and for my own sake too would rather be quite independent so long as i have a crust of bread of my own and such #child# as you and $dounia$
if possible i would settle somewhere near you for the most joyful piece of news dear $rodya$ i have kept for the #end# of my letter know then my dear boy that we may perhaps be all together in a very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of almost three years
it is settled for certain that $dounia$ and i are to set off for petersburg exactly when i dont know but very very soon possibly in a week
it all depends on $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ who will let us know when he has had time to look round him in petersburg
to suit his own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible even before the fast of our lady if it could be managed or if that is too soon to be ready immediately after
$dounia$ is all excitement at the joyful #thought# of seeing you she said one #day# in joke that she would be ready to marry $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ for that alone
she is not writing anything to you now and has only told me to write that she has so much so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now for a few lines would tell you nothing and it would only mean upsetting herself
oh with what happiness i shall press you to my heart she is an angel she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses
but although we shall be meeting so soon perhaps i shall send you as much money as i can in a #day# or two
i know that afanasy ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy five #rouble# on the security of my pension so that perhaps i shall be able to send you twenty five or even thirty #rouble#
i would send you more but i am uneasy about our travelling expenses for though $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ has been so #kind# as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey that is to say he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big trunk which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his we must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in petersburg where we cant be left without a halfpenny at least for the first few #day#
but we have calculated it all $dounia$ and i to the last penny and we see that the journey will not cost very much
now that everyone has heard that $dounia$ is to marry $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ my credit has suddenly improved and it is only ninety versts from us to the railway
and we have come to an agreement with a driver we know so as to be in readiness and from there $dounia$ and i can travel quite comfortably third class
but enough i have covered two sheets already and there is no space left for more our whole history but so many events have happened
so that i may very likely be able to send to you not twenty five but thirty #rouble# and now my precious $rodya$ i embrace you and send you a #mother# blessing till we meet
love $dounia$ your sister $rodya$ love her as she loves you and understand that she loves you beyond everything more than herself
she is an angel and you $rodya$ you are everything to us our one #hope# our one consolation if only you are happy we shall be happy
i am afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of infidelity that is abroad to #day# if it is so i pray for you
remember dear boy how in your childhood when your father was living you used to lisp your prayers at my knee and how happy we all were in those #day#
do you still say your prayers $rodya$ and believe in the mercy of our creator and our redeemer good bye till we meet then i embrace you warmly warmly with many kisses
almost from the first while he read the letter $mr_raskolnikov$ face was wet with tears but when he finished it his face was pale and distorted and a bitter wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips
yours till death pulcheria $mr_raskolnikov$ he laid his #head# down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered pondered a long time
his heart was beating violently and his brain was in a turmoil at last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was like a cupboard or a box
his eyes and his mind craved for space he took up his hat and went out this time without dread of meeting #anyone# he had forgotten his dread
he turned in the direction of the vassilyevsky ostrov walking along vassilyevsky prospect as though hastening on some business but he walked as his habit was without noticing his way muttering and even speaking aloud to himself to the astonishment of the passers by
his #mother# letter had been a torture to him but as regards the chief fact in it he had felt not one moment #hesitation# even whilst he was reading the letter
the essential question was settled and irrevocably settled in his mind never such a marriage while i am alive and mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ be damned
many of them took him to be drunk chapter iv the thing is perfectly clear he muttered to himself with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his decision
no #mother# no $dounia$ you wont deceive me and then they apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without me
i dare say they imagine it is arranged now and cant be broken off but we will see whether it can or not
a magnificent excuse $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ is such a busy #man# that even his wedding has to be in post haste almost by express
and i know too what you were thinking about when you walked up and down all night and what your prayers were like before the holy #mother# of kazan who stands in #mother# bedroom
no $dounia$ i see it all and i know what you want to say to me bitter is the ascent to golgotha
you have determined to marry a sensible business #man# $avdotya_romanovna$ one who has a fortune has already made his fortune that is so much more solid and impressive a #man# who holds two government posts and who shares the ideas of our most rising generation as #mother# writes and who seems to be #kind# as $dounia$ herself observes
hm so it is finally settled that seems beats everything and that very $dounia$ for that very seems is marrying him
splendid splendid but i should like to know why #mother# has written to me about our most rising generation
simply as a descriptive touch or with the idea of prepossessing me in favour of mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ oh the cunning of them
i should like to know one thing more how far they were open with one another that #day# and night and all this time since
was it all put into words or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their minds so that there was no need to speak of it aloud and better not to speak of it
most likely it was partly like that from #mother# letter it evident he struck her as rude a little and #mother# in her simplicity took her observations to $dounia$
who would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questions and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it
and she was sure to be vexed and answered her angrily i should think so and why does she write to me love $dounia$ $rodya$ and she loves you more than herself
has she a secret conscience prick at sacrificing her daughter to her son you are our one comfort you are everything to us
his bitterness grew more and more intense and if he had happened to meet mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ at the moment he might have murdered him
yes that true he continued pursuing the whirling ideas that chased each other in his brain it is true that it needs time and care to get to know a #man# but there is no mistake about mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
the chief thing is he is a #man# of business and seems #kind# that was #something# wasnt it to send the bags and big box for them
but his bride and her #mother# are to drive in a peasant cart covered with sacking i know i have been driven in it
oh #mother# hm a #kind# #man# no doubt after that no matter it is only ninety versts and then they can travel very comfortably third class for a thousand versts
quite right too one must cut one coat according to one cloth but what about you mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ she is your bride
to be sure it a matter of business a partnership for mutual benefit with equal shares and expenses food and drink provided but pay for your tobacco
and you must be aware that her #mother# has to raise money on her pension for the journey the business #man# has got the better of them too
the luggage will cost less than their fares and very likely go for nothing how is it that they dont both see all that or is it that they dont want to see
and they are pleased pleased and to think that this is only the first blossoming and that the real fruits are to come
but what really matters is not the stinginess is not the meanness but the tone of the whole thing for that will be the tone after marriage it a foretaste of it
and #mother# too why should she be so lavish what will she have by the time she gets to petersburg three silver #rouble# or two paper ones as she says that old woman
she has her reasons already for guessing that she could not live with $dounia$ after the marriage even for the first few months
the good #man# has no doubt let slip #something# on that subject also though #mother# would deny it i shall refuse says she
is she counting on what is left of her hundred and twenty #rouble# of pension when afanasy ivanovitch debt is paid
hm what does she expect to live upon in petersburg afterwards on whom is she reckoning then she knits woollen shawls and embroiders cuffs ruining her old eyes
so she is building all her #hope# all the time on mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ generosity he will offer it of himself he will press it on me
and all her shawls dont add more than twenty #rouble# a year to her hundred and twenty i know that you may wait a long time for that
that how it always is with these schilleresque noble hearts till the last moment every goose is a swan with them till the last moment they #hope# for the best and will see nothing wrong and although they have an inkling of the other side of the picture yet they wont face the truth till they are forced to
the very #thought# of it makes them shiver they thrust the truth away with both #hand# until the #man# they deck out in false colours puts a fool cap on them with his own #hand#
i should like to know whether mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ has any orders of merit i bet he has the anna in his buttonhole and that he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants
he will be sure to have it for his wedding too enough of him confound him well #mother# i dont wonder at it like her god bless her but
how could $dounia$ dounia darling as though i did not know you you were nearly twenty when i saw you last i understood you then
i knew that two years and a half ago and for the last two and a half years i have been thinking about it thinking of just that that $dounia$ can put up with a great deal
if she could put up with $mr_svidrigaïlov$ and all the rest of it she certainly can put up with a great deal
and now #mother# and she have taken it into their #head# that she can put up with mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ who propounds the theory of the superiority of wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband bounty who propounds it too almost at the first interview
granted that he let it slip though he is a sensible #man# yet maybe it was not a slip at all but he meant to make himself clear as soon as possible but
#mother# writes that $dounia$ can put up with a great deal i know that very well $dounia$ dounia she understands the #man# of course but she will have to live with the #man#
she would not sell her soul she would not barter her moral freedom for comfort she would not barter it for all schleswig holstein much less mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ money
why she live on black bread and water no $dounia$ was not that sort when i knew her and she is still the same of course
it a bitter thing to spend one life a governess in the provinces for two hundred #rouble# but i know she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a lett with a german master than degrade her soul and her moral dignity by binding herself for ever to a #man# whom she does not respect and with whom she has nothing in common for her own advantage
and if mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ had been of unalloyed gold or one huge diamond she would never have consented to become his legal concubine
yes there no denying the svidrigaïlovs are a bitter pill why is she consenting then what the #point# of it what the answer
it clear enough for herself for her comfort to save her life she would not sell herself but for someone else she is doing it
for one she loves for one she adores she will sell herself that what it all amounts to for her brother for her #mother# she will sell herself
in such cases we overcome our moral feeling if necessary freedom peace conscience even all all are brought into the market
more than that we become casuists we learn to be jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves we can persuade ourselves that it is one duty for a good object
she will sell everything let my life go if only my dear ones may be happy that just like us it as clear as daylight
oh yes she can ensure his happiness keep him in the university make him a partner in the office make his whole future secure perhaps he may even be a rich #man# later on prosperous respected and may even #end# his life a famous #man#
it clear that $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ $mr_raskolnikov$ is the central figure in the business and no one else but my #mother# it all $rodya$ precious $rodya$ her first born
for such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter oh loving over partial hearts why for his sake we would not shrink even from $sonia$ fate
$sonia$ sonia $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ the eternal victim so long as the world lasts have you taken the measure of your sacrifice both of you
is it right can you bear it is it any use is there sense in it and let me tell you $dounia$ $sonia$ life is no worse than life with mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
there can be no question of love #mother# writes and what if there can be no respect either if on the contrary there is aversion contempt repulsion what then
so you will have to keep up your appearance too is not that so do you understand what that smartness means
do you understand that the $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ smartness is just the same thing as $sonia$ and may be worse viler baser because in your case $dounia$ it a bargain for luxuries after all but with $sonia$ it simply a question of starvation
it has to be paid for it has to be paid for $dounia$ this smartness and what if it more than you can bear afterwards if you regret it
the bitterness the #misery# the curses the tears hidden from all the world for you are not a $marfa_petrovna$ and how will your #mother# feel then
even now she is uneasy she is worried but then when she sees it all clearly and i yes indeed what have you taken me for
i wont have your sacrifice $dounia$ i wont have it #mother# it shall not be so long as i am alive it shall not it shall not
i wont accept it he suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still it shall not be but what are you going to do to prevent it
you ll forbid it and what right have you what can you promise them on your side to give you such a right
your whole life your whole future you will devote to them when you have finished your studies and obtained a post
yes we have heard all that before and that all words but now now #something# must be done now do you understand that
and what are you doing now you are living upon them they borrow on their hundred #rouble# pension they borrow from the svidrigaïlovs
how are you going to save them from svidrigaïlovs from afanasy ivanovitch vahrushin oh future millionaire zeus who would arrange their lives for them
in another ten years in another ten years #mother# will be blind with knitting shawls maybe with weeping too she will be worn to a shadow with fasting and my sister
imagine for a moment what may have become of your sister in ten years what may happen to her during those ten years
can you fancy so he tortured himself fretting himself with such questions and finding a #kind# of enjoyment in it
and yet all these questions were not new ones suddenly confronting him they were old familiar aches it was long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart
long long ago his present anguish had its first beginnings it had waxed and gathered strength it had matured and concentrated until it had taken the form of a fearful frenzied and fantastic question which tortured his heart and mind clamouring insistently for an answer
it was clear that he must not now suffer passively worrying himself over unsolved questions but that he must do #something# do it at once and do it quickly
now his #mother# letter had burst on him like a thunderclap anyway he must decide on #something# or else or throw up life altogether
he cried suddenly in a frenzy accept one lot humbly as it is once for all and stifle everything in oneself giving up all claim to activity life and love
do you understand sir do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ question came suddenly into his mind for every #man# must have somewhere to turn
but he did not start at the #thought# recurring to him for he knew he had felt beforehand that it must come back he was expecting it besides it was not only yesterday #thought#
the difference was that a month ago yesterday even the #thought# was a mere dream but now now it appeared not a dream at all it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape and he suddenly became aware of this himself
he gave a sudden start another #thought# that he had had yesterday slipped back into his mind he felt a hammering in his #head# and there was a darkness before his eyes
he looked round hurriedly he was searching for #something# he wanted to sit down and was looking for a seat he was walking along the boulevard
he walked towards it as fast he could but on the way he met with a little adventure which absorbed all his attention
looking for the seat he had noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him but at first he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his path
it had happened to him many times going home not to notice the road by which he was going and he was accustomed to walk like that
but there was at first sight #something# so strange about the woman in front of him that gradually his attention was riveted upon her at first reluctantly and as it were resentfully and then more and more intently
there was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him he felt a sudden #desire# to find out what it was
in the first place she appeared to be a girl quite young and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with no parasol or gloves waving her arms about in an absurd way
she had on a dress of some light silky material but put on strangely awry not properly hooked up and torn open at the top of the skirt close to the waist a great piece was rent and hanging loose
that was so strange about the woman a little kerchief was flung about her bare throat but lay slanting on one side
he overtook the girl at the seat but on reaching it she dropped down on it in the #corner# she let her #head# sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes apparently in extreme exhaustion
the girl was walking unsteadily too stumbling and staggering from side to side she drew $mr_raskolnikov$ whole attention at last looking at her closely he saw at once that she was completely drunk
he saw before him the face of a quite young fair haired girl sixteen perhaps not more than fifteen years old pretty little face but flushed and heavy looking and as it were swollen
the girl seemed hardly to know what she was doing she crossed one leg over the other lifting it indecorously and showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the #street#
it was a strange and shocking sight he could hardly believe that he was not mistaken $mr_raskolnikov$ did not sit down but he felt unwilling to leave her and stood facing her in perplexity
and yet on the further side of the boulevard about fifteen paces away a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement
this boulevard was never much frequented and now at two clock in the stifling heat it was quite deserted he too would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object of his own
he looked angrily at him though he tried to escape his notice and stood impatiently biding his time till the unwelcome #man# in rags should have moved away
he too had probably seen her in the distance and had followed her but found $mr_raskolnikov$ in his way his #intention# were unmistakable
the gentleman was a plump thickly set #man# about thirty fashionably dressed with a high colour red lips and moustaches $mr_raskolnikov$ felt furious he had a sudden longing to insult this fat dandy in some way
he left the girl for a moment and walked towards the gentleman hey you $mr_svidrigaïlov$ what do you want here
he shouted clenching his fists and laughing spluttering with rage what do you mean the gentleman asked sternly scowling in haughty astonishment
$mr_raskolnikov$ rushed at him with his fists without reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two #man# like himself
get away that what i mean how dare you you low fellow he raised his cane but at that instant someone seized him from behind and a police constable stood between them
that enough gentlemen no fighting please in a public place what do you want who are you he asked $mr_raskolnikov$ sternly noticing his rags
$mr_raskolnikov$ looked at him intently he had a straight forward sensible soldierly face with grey moustaches and whiskers you are just the #man# i want $mr_raskolnikov$ cried catching at his arm
i am a student $mr_raskolnikov$ you may as well know that too he added addressing the gentleman come along i have #something# to show you
and taking the policeman by the #hand# he drew him towards the seat look here hopelessly drunk and she has just come down the boulevard
there is no telling who and what she is she does not look like a professional it more likely she has been given drink and deceived somewhere
look at the way her dress is torn and the way it has been put on she has been dressed by somebody she has not dressed herself and dressed by unpractised #hand# by a #man# #hand# that evident
i dont know that dandy with whom i was going to fight i see him for the first time but he too has seen her on the road just now drunk not knowing what she is doing and now he is very eager to get hold of her to get her away somewhere while she is in this state
for the first time you understand and they ve put her out into the #street# like that and now look there that certain believe me i am not wrong
i saw him myself watching her and following her but i prevented him and he is just waiting for me to go away
now he has walked away a little and is standing still pretending to make a cigarette think how can we keep her out of his #hand# and how are we to get her home
the policeman saw it all in a flash the stout gentleman was easy to understand he turned to consider the girl
the policeman bent over to examine her more closely and his face worked with genuine compassion ah what a pity
he said shaking his #head# why she is quite a #child# she has been deceived you can see that at once
listen lady he began addressing her where do you live the girl opened her weary and sleepy looking eyes gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her #hand#
here said $mr_raskolnikov$ feeling in his #pocket# and finding twenty copecks here call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address
the only thing is to find out her address missy missy the policeman began again taking the money
i ll fetch you a cab and take you home myself where shall i take you eh where do you live go away
they wont let me alone the girl muttered and once more waved her #hand# ach ach how shocking it shameful missy it a shame
it a difficult job the policeman said to $mr_raskolnikov$ and as he did so he looked him up and down in a rapid glance
he shook his #head# again shocked sympathetic and indignant he too must have seemed a strange figure to him dressed in rags and handing him money
did you meet her far from here he asked him i tell you she was walking in front of me staggering just here in the boulevard
she only just reached the seat and sank down on it ah the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays god have mercy on us
an innocent creature like that drunk already she has been deceived that a sure thing see how her dress has been torn too
ah the vice one sees nowadays and as likely as not she belongs to gentlefolk too poor ones maybe there are many like that nowadays
she looks refined too as though she were a lady and he bent over her once more perhaps he had daughters growing up like that looking like ladies and refined with pretensions to gentility and smartness
the chief thing is $mr_raskolnikov$ persisted to keep her out of this scoundrel #hand# why should he outrage her it as clear as #day# what he is after ah the brute he is not moving off
the gentleman heard him and seemed about to fly into a rage again but #thought# better of it and confined himself to a contemptuous look
keep her out of his #hand# we can said the constable thoughtfully if only she tell us where to take her but as it is
$mr_raskolnikov$ spoke aloud and pointed to him he then walked slowly another ten paces away and again halted missy hey missy
she opened her eyes fully all of a sudden looked at him intently as though realising #something# got up from the seat and walked away in the direction from which she had come
he bent over her once more oh shameful wretches they wont let me alone she said waving her #hand# again
she walked quickly though staggering as before the dandy followed her but along another avenue keeping his eye on her
dont be anxious i wont let him have her the policeman said resolutely and he set off after them ah the vice one sees nowadays
he repeated aloud sighing at that moment #something# seemed to sting $mr_raskolnikov$ in an instant a complete revulsion of feeling came over him
hey here he shouted after the policeman the latter turned round let them be what is it to do with you
let her go let him amuse himself he pointed at the dandy what is it to do with you the policeman was bewildered and stared at him open eyed
well ejaculated the policeman with a gesture of contempt and he walked after the dandy and the girl probably taking $mr_raskolnikov$ for a madman or #something# even worse
well let him take as much from the other fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it #end#
$mr_raskolnikov$ laughed he has carried off my twenty copecks $mr_raskolnikov$ murmured angrily when he was left alone and why did i want to interfere
is it for me to help have i any right to help let them devour each other alive what is to me
how did i dare to give him twenty copecks were they mine in #spite# of those strange words he felt very wretched
he sat down on the deserted seat his #thought# strayed aimlessly he found it hard to fix his mind on anything at that moment
he longed to forget himself altogether to forget everything and then to wake up and begin life anew poor girl
he said looking at the empty #corner# where she had sat she will come to herself and weep and then her #mother# will find out
and even if she does not the darya frantsovnas will get wind of it and the girl will soon be slipping out on the sly here and there
then there will be the hospital directly that always the luck of those girls with respectable #mother# who go wrong on the sly and then again the hospital drink the taverns and more hospital in two or three years a wreck and her life over at eighteen or nineteen
she will give her a beating a horrible shameful beating and then maybe turn her out of #door# have not i seen cases like that
and how have they been brought to it why they ve all come to it like that ugh but what does it matter
a certain percentage they tell us must every year go that way to the devil i suppose so that the rest may remain chaste and not be interfered with
that as it should be they tell us a percentage what splendid words they have they are so scientific so consolatory
once you ve said percentage there nothing more to worry about if we had any other word maybe we might feel more uneasy
but what if $dounia$ were one of the percentage of another one if not that one but where am i going
he #thought# suddenly strange i came out for #something# as soon as i had read the letter i came out
i was going to vassilyevsky ostrov to $mr_razumihin$ that what it was now i remember what for though and what put the idea of going to $mr_razumihin$ into my #head# just now
it was remarkable that $mr_raskolnikov$ had hardly any #friend# at the university he kept aloof from everyone went to see no one and did not welcome #anyone# who came to see him and indeed everyone soon gave him up
that curious he wondered at himself $mr_razumihin$ was one of his old comrades at the university he took no part in the students gatherings amusements or conversations
he was very poor and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him as though he were keeping #something# to himself
he seemed to some of his comrades to look down upon them all as #child# as though he were superior in development knowledge and convictions as though their beliefs and interests were beneath him
he worked with great intensity without sparing himself and he was respected for this but no one liked him with $mr_razumihin$ he had got on or at least he was more unreserved and communicative with him
he was an exceptionally good humoured and candid youth good natured to the #point# of simplicity though both depth and dignity lay concealed under that simplicity
indeed it was impossible to be on any other terms with $mr_razumihin$ the better of his comrades understood this and all were fond of him
he was extremely intelligent though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times he was of striking appearance tall thin blackhaired and always badly shaved
he was sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength one night when out in a festive company he had with one blow laid a gigantic policeman on his back
there was no limit to his drinking powers but he could abstain from drink altogether he sometimes went too far in his pranks but he could do without pranks altogether
another thing striking about $mr_razumihin$ no failure distressed him and it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him he could lodge anywhere and bear the extremes of cold and hunger
he was very poor and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of one sort or another he knew of no #end# of resources by which to earn money
he spent one whole winter without lighting his stove and used to declare that he liked it better because one slept more soundly in the cold
for the present he too had been obliged to give up the university but it was only for a time and he was working with all his might to save enough to return to his studies again
about two months before they had met in the #street# but $mr_raskolnikov$ had turned away and even crossed to the other side that he might not be observed
$mr_raskolnikov$ had not been to see him for the last four months and $mr_razumihin$ did not even know his address and though $mr_razumihin$ noticed him he passed him by as he did not want to annoy him
of course i ve been meaning lately to go to $mr_razumihin$ to ask for work to ask him to get me lessons or #something#
suppose he gets me lessons suppose he shares his last farthing with me if he has any farthings so that i could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons
chapter $mr_raskolnikov$ #thought# but what help can he be to me now hm well and what then
what shall i do with the few coppers i earn that not what i want now it really absurd for me to go to $mr_razumihin$
the question why he was now going to $mr_razumihin$ agitated him even more than he was himself aware he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister significance in this apparently ordinary action
could i have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by means of $mr_razumihin$ alone
he pondered and rubbed his forehead and strange to say after long musing suddenly as if it were spontaneously and by chance a fantastic #thought# came into his #head#
he asked himself in perplexity hm to $mr_razumihin$ he said all at once calmly as though he had reached a final determination
i shall go to him on the next #day# after it when it will be over and everything will begin afresh
i shall go to $mr_razumihin$ of course but not now and suddenly he realised what he was thinking
after it he shouted jumping up from the seat but is it really going to happen is it possible it really will happen
he left the seat and went off almost at a run he meant to turn back homewards but the #thought# of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing in that hole in that awful little cupboard of his all this had for a month past been growing up in him and he walked on at random
his nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel shivering in #spite# of the heat he felt cold
with a #kind# of effort he began almost unconsciously from some inner craving to stare at all the objects before him as though looking for #something# to distract his attention but he did not succeed and kept dropping every moment into brooding
when with a start he lifted his #head# again and looked round he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he was going
in this way he walked right across vassilyevsky ostrov came out on to the lesser neva crossed the bridge and turned towards the islands
the greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in and weighed upon him
here there were no taverns no stifling closeness no stench but soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid irritability
sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer villa standing among green foliage he gazed through the fence he saw in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies and #child# running in the gardens
he was met too by luxurious carriages and by #man# and women on horseback he watched them with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from his sight
the flowers especially caught his attention he gazed at them longer than at anything once he stood still and counted his money he found he had thirty copecks
twenty to the policeman three to $nastasya$ for the letter so i must have given forty seven or fifty to the marmeladovs yesterday he #thought# reckoning it up for some unknown reason but he soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his #pocket#
he recalled it on passing an eating house or tavern and felt that he was hungry going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a pie of some sort
it was a long while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once though he only drank a wineglassful
he turned homewards but reaching petrovsky ostrov he stopped completely exhausted turned off the road into the bushes sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep
he finished eating it as he walked away his legs felt suddenly heavy and a great drowsiness came upon him in a morbid condition of the brain dreams often have a singular actuality vividness and extraordinary semblance of reality
at times monstrous images are created but the setting and the whole picture are so truth like and filled with details so delicate so unexpectedly but so artistically consistent that the dreamer were he an artist like pushkin or turgenev even could never have invented them in the waking state
such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system
he was a #child# about seven years old walking into the country with his father on the #evening# of a holiday
it was a grey and heavy #day# the country was exactly as he remembered it indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in memory
the little town stood on a level flat as bare as the #hand# not even a willow near it only in the far distance a copse lay a dark blur on the very edge of the horizon
a few paces beyond the last market garden stood a tavern a big tavern which had always aroused in him a feeling of aversion even of fear when he walked by it with his father
$mr_raskolnikov$ had a fearful dream he dreamt he was back in his childhood in the little town of his birth there was always a crowd there always shouting laughter and abuse hideous hoarse singing and often fighting
drunken and horrible looking figures were hanging about the tavern he used to cling close to his father trembling all over when he met them
near the tavern the road became a dusty track the dust of which was always black it was a winding road and about a hundred paces further on it turned to the right to the graveyard
in the middle of the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three times a year with his father and #mother# when a service was held in memory of his grandmother who had long been dead and whom he had never seen
on these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in the shape of a cross
near his grandmother grave which was marked by a stone was the little grave of his younger brother who had died at six months old
he did not remember him at all but he had been told about his little brother and whenever he visited the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and to bow down and kiss the little grave
and now he dreamt that he was walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard he was holding his father #hand# and looking with dread at the tavern
a peculiar circumstance attracted his attention there seemed to be some #kind# of festivity going on there were crowds of gaily dressed townspeople peasant women their husbands and riff raff of all sorts all singing and all more or less drunk
he loved that church the old fashioned unadorned ikons and the old priest with the shaking #head# near the entrance of the tavern stood a cart but a strange cart
it was one of those big carts usually drawn by heavy cart horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy goods
he always liked looking at those great cart horses with their long manes thick legs and slow even pace drawing along a perfect mountain with no appearance of effort as though it were easier going with a load than without it
but now strange to say in the shafts of such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast one of those peasants nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load of wood or hay especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in a rut
and the peasants would beat them so cruelly sometimes even about the nose and eyes and he felt so sorry so sorry for them that he almost cried and his #mother# always used to take him away from the window
all of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting singing and the balalaïka and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken peasants came out wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over their shoulders
get in get in shouted one of them a young thick necked peasant with a fleshy face red as a carrot
i ll take you all get in but at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the crowd
take us all with a beast like that why $mikolka$ are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart
get in i ll take you all $mikolka$ shouted again leaping first into the cart seizing the reins and standing straight up in front
the bay has gone with matvey he shouted from the cart and this brute mates is just breaking my heart i feel as if i could kill her
and this mare is twenty if she is a #day# mates she just eating her #head# off get in i tell you
i ll make her gallop she ll gallop and he picked up the whip preparing himself with relish to flog the little mare
get in come along the crowd laughed you hear she ll gallop gallop indeed she has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years
she ll jog along dont you mind her mates bring a whip each of you get ready all right give it to her
they all clambered into $mikolka$ cart laughing and making jokes six #man# got in and there was still room for more
she was dressed in red cotton in a pointed beaded headdress and thick leather shoes she was cracking nuts and laughing
they hauled in a fat rosy cheeked woman the crowd round them was laughing too and indeed how could they help laughing
that wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a gallop two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to help $mikolka$
with the cry of now the mare tugged with all her might but far from galloping could scarcely move forward she struggled with her legs gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which were showered upon her like hail
the laughter in the cart and in the crowd was redoubled but $mikolka$ flew into a rage and furiously thrashed the mare as though he supposed she really could gallop
let me get in too mates shouted a young #man# in the crowd whose appetite was aroused get in all get in cried $mikolka$ she will draw you all
i ll beat her to death and he thrashed and thrashed at the mare beside himself with fury father father he cried father what are they doing
they are drunken and foolish they are in fun come away dont look and he tried to draw him away but he tore himself away from his #hand# and beside himself with horror ran to the horse
father they are beating the poor horse come along come along said his father the poor beast was in a bad way
she was gasping standing still then tugging again and almost falling beat her to death cried $mikolka$ it come to that
i ll do for her what are you about are you a christian you devil shouted an old #man# in the crowd
did #anyone# ever see the like a wretched nag like that pulling such a cartload said another you ll kill her shouted the third
dont meddle it my property i ll do what i choose get in more of you get in all of you
all at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything the mare roused by the shower of blows began feebly kicking
i will have her go at a gallop even the old #man# could not help smiling to think of a wretched little beast like that trying to kick
two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her about the ribs one ran each side
give us a song mates shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the cart joined in a riotous song jingling a tambourine and whistling
hit her in the face in the eyes in the eyes cried $mikolka$ the woman went on cracking nuts and laughing
he ran beside the mare ran in front of her saw her being whipped across the eyes right in the eyes
he was crying he felt choking his tears were streaming one of the #man# gave him a cut with the whip across the face he did not feel it
wringing his #hand# and screaming he rushed up to the grey headed old #man# with the grey beard who was shaking his #head# in disapproval
one woman seized him by the #hand# and would have taken him away but he tore himself from her and ran back to the mare
she was almost at the last gasp but began kicking once more i ll teach you to kick $mikolka$ shouted ferociously
he threw down the whip bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long thick shaft he took hold of one #end# with both #hand# and with an effort brandished it over the mare
he ll crush her was shouted round him he ll kill her it my property shouted $mikolka$ and brought the shaft down with a swinging blow
there was a sound of a heavy thud thrash her thrash her why have you stopped shouted voices in the crowd
and $mikolka$ swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time on the spine of the luckless mare
she sank back on her haunches but lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force tugged first on one side and then on the other trying to move the cart
but the six whips were attacking her in all directions and the shaft was raised again and fell upon her a third time then a fourth with heavy measured blows
$mikolka$ was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow she a tough one was shouted in the crowd
she ll fall in a minute mates there will soon be an #end# of her said an admiring spectator in the crowd
stand off $mikolka$ screamed frantically he threw down the shaft stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar
fetch an axe to her finish her off shouted a third i ll show you look out he shouted and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the poor mare
the blow fell the mare staggered sank back tried to pull but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back
and she fell on the ground like a log finish her off shouted $mikolka$ and he leapt beside himself out of the cart
several young #man# also flushed with drink seized anything they could come across whips sticks poles and ran to the dying mare
$mikolka$ stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the crowbar the mare stretched out her #head# drew a long breath and died
you butchered her someone shouted in the crowd why wouldnt she gallop then my property shouted $mikolka$ with bloodshot eyes brandishing the bar in his #hand#
he stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to beat no mistake about it you are not a christian many voices were shouting in the crowd
but the poor boy beside himself made his way screaming through the crowd to the sorrel nag put his arms round her bleeding dead #head# and kissed it kissed the eyes and kissed the lips
at that instant his father who had been running after him snatched him up and carried him out of the crowd
then he jumped up and flew in a frenzy with his little fists out at $mikolka$ come along come let us go home he said to him
father why did they kill the poor horse he sobbed but his voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest
they are drunk they are brutal it not our business said his father he put his arms round his father
but he felt choked choked he tried to draw a breath to cry out and woke up he waked up gasping for breath his hair soaked with perspiration and stood up in terror
thank god that was only a dream he said sitting down under a tree and drawing deep breaths but what is it
is it some fever coming on such a hideous dream he felt utterly broken darkness and #confusion# were in his soul
he cried can it be can it be that i shall really take an axe that i shall strike her on the #head# split her skull open that i shall tread in the sticky warm blood break the lock steal and tremble hide
he rested his elbows on his knees and leaned his #head# on his #hand# good god all spattered in the blood with the axe
good god can it be he was shaking like a leaf as he said this but why am i going on like this
he continued sitting up again as it were in profound amazement i knew that i could never bring myself to it so what have i been torturing myself for till now
yesterday yesterday when i went to make that experiment yesterday i realised completely that i could never bear to do it
why am i going over it again then why am i hesitating as i came down the stairs yesterday i said myself that it was base loathsome vile vile
the very #thought# of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror no i couldnt do it i couldnt do it
granted granted that there is no flaw in all that reasoning that all that i have concluded this last month is clear as #day# true as arithmetic
my god anyway i couldnt bring myself to it i couldnt do it i couldnt do it why why then am i still
he rose to his feet looked round in wonder as though surprised at finding himself in this place and went towards the bridge
he was pale his eyes glowed he was exhausted in every limb but he seemed suddenly to breathe more easily
he felt he had cast off that fearful burden that had so long been weighing upon him and all at once there was a sense of relief and peace in his soul
crossing the bridge he gazed quietly and calmly at the neva at the glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky
lord he prayed show me my path i renounce that accursed dream of mine in #spite# of his weakness he was not conscious of fatigue
it was as though an abscess that had been forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken freedom freedom
later on when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during those #day# minute by minute #point# by #point# he was superstitiously impressed by one circumstance which though in itself not very exceptional always seemed to him afterwards the predestined turning #point# of his fate
he could never understand and explain to himself why when he was tired and worn out when it would have been more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way he had returned by the hay market where he had no need to go
he was free from that spell that sorcery that obsession it was obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way though not much so
it is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without noticing what #street# he passed through
but why he was always asking himself why had such an important such a decisive and at the same time such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the hay market where he had moreover no reason to go at the very hour the very minute of his life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive influence on his whole destiny
as though it had been lying in wait for him on purpose it was about nine clock when he crossed the hay market
at the tables and the barrows at the booths and the shops all the market people were closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their wares and like their customers were going home
rag pickers and costermongers of all #kind# were crowding round the taverns in the dirty and stinking courtyards of the hay market
$mr_raskolnikov$ particularly liked this place and the neighbouring alleys when he wandered aimlessly in the #street# here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people
at the #corner# of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out with tapes thread cotton handkerchiefs etc
they too had got up to go home but were lingering in conversation with a #friend# who had just come up to them
this #friend# was $lizaveta_ivanovna$ $katerina_ivanovna$ or as everyone called her $lizaveta_ivanovna$ the younger sister of the old pawnbroker alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ whom $mr_raskolnikov$ had visited the previous #day# to pawn his watch and make his experiment
he already knew all about $lizaveta_ivanovna$ and she knew him a little too she was a single woman of about thirty five tall clumsy timid submissive and almost idiotic
she was a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister who made her work #day# and night and even beat her
she was standing with a bundle before the huckster and his wife listening earnestly and doubtfully they were talking of #something# with special warmth
the moment $mr_raskolnikov$ caught sight of her he was overcome by a strange sensation as it were of intense astonishment though there was nothing astonishing about this meeting
you could make up your mind for yourself $lizaveta_ivanovna$ $katerina_ivanovna$ the huckster was saying aloud come round to morrow about seven
they will be here too to morrow said $lizaveta_ivanovna$ slowly and thoughtfully as though unable to make up her mind
upon my word what a fright you are in of alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ gabbled the huckster wife a lively little woman
i look at you you are like some little babe and she is not your own sister either nothing but a #step# sister and what a #hand#
but this time dont say a word to alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ her husband interrupted that my advice but come round to us without asking
she keeps over you it will be worth your while later on your sister herself may have a notion am i to come
about seven clock to morrow and they will be here you will be able to decide for yourself and we ll have a cup of tea added his wife
all right i ll come said $lizaveta_ivanovna$ still pondering and she began slowly moving away $mr_raskolnikov$ had just passed and heard no more
he passed softly unnoticed trying not to miss a word his first amazement was followed by a thrill of horror like a shiver running down his spine
he had learnt he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt that the next #day# at seven clock $lizaveta_ivanovna$ the old woman sister and only companion would be away from home and that therefore at seven clock precisely the old woman would be left alone
he #thought# of nothing and was incapable of thinking but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom of #thought# no will and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably decided
certainly if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity he could not reckon on a more certain #step# towards the success of the plan than that which had just presented itself
in any case it would have been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty with greater exactness and less risk and without dangerous inquiries and investigations that next #day# at a certain time an old woman on whose life an attempt was contemplated would be at home and entirely alone
he was only a few #step# from his lodging he went in like a #man# condemned to death chapter vi later on $mr_raskolnikov$ happened to find out why the huckster and his wife had invited $lizaveta_ivanovna$
a family who had come to the town and been reduced to #poverty# were selling their household goods and clothes all women things
it was a very ordinary matter and there was nothing exceptional about it as the things would have fetched little in the market they were looking for a dealer
she undertook such jobs and was frequently employed as she was very honest and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it
this was $lizaveta_ivanovna$ business she spoke as a rule little and as we have said already she was very submissive and timid
and in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see #something# strange and mysterious as it were the presence of some peculiar influences and coincidences
in the previous winter a student he knew called pokorev who had left for harkov had chanced in conversation to give him the address of alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ the old pawnbroker in case he might want to pawn anything
but $mr_raskolnikov$ had become superstitious of late the traces of superstition remained in him long after and were almost ineradicable for a long while he did not go to her for he had lessons and managed to get along somehow
six weeks ago he had remembered the address he had two articles that could be pawned his father old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones a present from his sister at parting
when he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her at the first glance though he knew nothing special about her
he decided to take the ring he got two #rouble# from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way home
he asked for tea sat down and sank into deep #thought# a strange idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg and very very much absorbed him
almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student whom he did not know and had never seen and with him a young officer
they had played a game of billiards and began drinking tea all at once he heard the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ and give him her address
this of itself seemed strange to $mr_raskolnikov$ he had just come from her and here at once he heard her name
of course it was a chance but he could not shake off a very extraordinary impression and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him the student began telling his #friend# various details about alyona $katerina_ivanovna$
she is as rich as a jew she can give you five thousand #rouble# at a time and she is not above taking a pledge for a #rouble#
she is first rate he said you can always get money from her lots of our fellows have had dealings with her
and he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was how if you were only a #day# late with your interest the pledge was lost how she gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven percent a month on it and so on
the student chattered on saying that she had a sister $lizaveta_ivanovna$ whom the wretched little creature was continually beating and kept in complete bondage like a small #child# though $lizaveta_ivanovna$ was at least six feet high
but she is an awful old harpy there a phenomenon for you cried the student and he laughed they began talking about $lizaveta_ivanovna$
the student spoke about her with a peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened with great interest and asked him to send $lizaveta_ivanovna$ to do some mending for him
$mr_raskolnikov$ did not miss a word and learned everything about her $lizaveta_ivanovna$ was younger than the old woman and was her half sister being the #child# of a different #mother#
she worked #day# and night for her sister and besides doing the cooking and the washing she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister all she earned
the old woman had already made her will and $lizaveta_ivanovna$ knew of it and by this will she would not get a farthing nothing but the movables chairs and so on all the money was left to a monastery in the province of that prayers might be said for her in perpetuity
$lizaveta_ivanovna$ was of lower rank than her sister unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance remarkably tall with long feet that looked as if they were bent outwards
she was thirty five she did not dare to accept an order or job of any #kind# without her sister permission she always wore battered goatskin shoes and was clean in her person
what the student expressed most surprise and amusement about was the fact that $lizaveta_ivanovna$ was continually with #child# but you say she is hideous observed the officer
yes she is so dark skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up but you know she is not at all hideous
she has such a good natured face and eyes strikingly so and the proof of it is that lots of people are attracted by her
she is such a soft gentle creature ready to put up with anything always willing willing to do anything and her smile is really very sweet
i could kill that damned old woman and make off with her money i assure you without the faintest conscience prick the student added with warmth
you seem to find her attractive yourself laughed the officer from her queerness no i ll tell you what the officer laughed again while $mr_raskolnikov$ shuddered
i was joking of course but look here on one side we have a stupid senseless worthless spiteful ailing horrid old woman not simply useless but doing actual mischief who has not an idea what she is living for herself and who will die in a #day# or two in any case
how strange it was listen i want to ask you a serious question the student said hotly you understand
you understand yes yes i understand answered the officer watching his excited companion attentively well listen then on the other side fresh young lives thrown away for want of help and by thousands on every side
a hundred thousand good deeds could be done and helped on that old woman money which will be buried in a monastery
hundreds thousands perhaps might be set on the right path dozens of families saved from destitution from ruin from vice from the lock hospitals and all with her money
kill her take her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all
what do you think would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds for one life thousands would be saved from corruption and decay
one death and a hundred lives in exchange it simple arithmetic besides what value has the life of that sickly stupid ill natured old woman in the balance of existence
no more than the life of a louse of a black beetle less in fact because the old woman is doing harm
she is wearing out the lives of others the other #day# she bit $lizaveta_ivanovna$ finger out of #spite# it almost had to be amputated
oh well brother but we have to correct and direct nature and but for that we should drown in an ocean of prejudice
of course she does not deserve to live remarked the officer but there it is it nature but for that there would never have been a single great #man#
they talk of duty conscience i dont want to say anything against duty and conscience but the #point# is what do we mean by them
stay i have another question to ask you listen no you stay i ll ask you a question listen well
you are talking and speechifying away but tell me would you kill the old woman yourself of course not i was only arguing the justice of it
it nothing to do with me but i think if you would not do it yourself there no justice about it
of course it was all ordinary youthful talk and #thought# such as he had often heard before in different forms and on different themes
but why had he happened to hear such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain was just conceiving the very same ideas
and why just at the moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her
this trivial talk in a tavern had an immense influence on him in his later action as though there had really been in it #something# preordained some guiding hint
on returning from the hay market he flung himself on the sofa and sat for a whole hour without stirring
let us have another game $mr_raskolnikov$ was violently agitated this coincidence always seemed strange to him meanwhile it got dark he had no candle and indeed it did not occur to him to light up
at last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering and he realised with relief that he could lie down on the sofa
he could never recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time soon heavy leaden sleep came over him as it were crushing him
he slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming $nastasya$ coming into his room at ten clock the next morning had difficulty in rousing him
she brought him in tea and bread the tea was again the second brew and again in her own tea pot
my goodness how he sleeps she cried indignantly and he is always asleep he got up with an effort
his #head# ached he stood up took a turn in his #garret# and sank back on the sofa again going to sleep again cried $nastasya$
are you ill eh he made no reply do you want some tea afterwards he said with an effort closing his eyes again and turning to the #wall#
$nastasya$ stood over him perhaps he really is ill she said turned and went out she came in again at two clock with soup
he was lying as before the tea stood untouched $nastasya$ felt positively offended and began wrathfully rousing him why are you lying like a log
she shouted looking at him with repulsion he got up and sat down again but said nothing and stared at the floor
are you ill or not asked $nastasya$ and again received no answer you better go out and get a breath of air she said after a pause
will you eat it or not afterwards he said weakly you can go and he motioned her out
she remained a little longer looked at him with compassion and went out a few minutes afterwards he raised his eyes and looked for a long while at the tea and the soup
then he took the bread took up a spoon and began to eat he ate a little three or four spoonfuls without appetite as it were mechanically
after his meal he stretched himself on the sofa again but now he could not sleep he lay without stirring with his face in the pillow
he was haunted by #day# dreams and such strange #day# dreams in one that kept recurring he fancied that he was in africa in egypt in some sort of oasis
the caravan was resting the camels were peacefully lying down the palms stood all around in a complete circle all the party were at dinner
his #head# ached less but he was drinking water from a spring which flowed gurgling close by and it was so cool
it was wonderful wonderful blue cold water running among the parti coloured stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like gold
he started roused himself raised his #head# looked out of the window and seeing how late it was suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the sofa
suddenly he heard a clock strike he crept on tiptoe to the #door# stealthily opened it and began listening on the #staircase#
it seemed to him strange and monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the previous #day# and had done nothing had prepared nothing yet
his heart beat terribly but all was quiet on the stairs as if everyone was asleep and meanwhile perhaps it had struck six
and his drowsiness and stupefaction were followed by an extraordinary feverish as it were distracted haste but the preparations to be made were few
he concentrated all his energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing and his heart kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe
he rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away under it a worn out old unwashed shirt
first he had to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat a work of a moment from its rags he tore a long strip a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long
he folded this strip in two took off his wide strong summer overcoat of some stout cotton material his only outer garment and began sewing the two #end# of the rag on the inside under the left armhole
his #hand# shook as he sewed but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside when he put the coat on again
the needle and thread he had got ready long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper
as for the noose it was a very ingenious device of his own the noose was intended for the axe it was impossible for him to carry the axe through the #street# in his #hand#
and if hidden under his coat he would still have had to support it with his #hand# which would have been noticeable
now he had only to put the #head# of the axe in the noose and it would hang quietly under his arm on the inside
putting his #hand# in his coat #pocket# he could hold the #end# of the handle all the way so that it did not swing and as the coat was very full a regular sack in fact it could not be seen from outside that he was holding #something# with the #hand# that was in the #pocket#
when he had finished with this he thrust his #hand# into a little opening between his sofa and the floor fumbled in the left #corner# and drew out the pledge which he had got ready long before and hidden there
this noose too he had designed a fortnight before this pledge was however only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and thickness of a silver cigarette case
he picked up this piece of wood in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of a workshop
afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece of iron which he had also picked up at the same time in the #street#
putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood he fastened them very firmly crossing and re crossing the thread round them then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it
this was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time while she was trying to undo the knot and so to gain a moment
the iron strip was added to give weight so that the woman might not guess the first minute that the thing was made of wood
all this had been stored by him beforehand under the sofa he had only just got the pledge out when he heard someone suddenly about in the yard
he rushed to the #door# listened caught up his hat and began to descend his thirteen #step# cautiously noiselessly like a cat
it struck six long ago long ago my god he had still the most important thing to do to steal the axe from the kitchen
he had also a #pocket# pruning knife but he could not rely on the knife and still less on his own strength and so resolved finally on the axe
we may note in passing one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by him in the matter they had one strange characteristic the more final they were
that the deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in his eyes
in #spite# of all his agonising inward struggle he never for a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his plans
and indeed if it had ever happened that everything to the least #point# could have been considered and finally settled and no uncertainty of any #kind# had remained he would it seems have renounced it all as #something# absurd monstrous and impossible
but a whole mass of unsettled #point# and uncertainties remained as for getting the axe that trifling business cost him no anxiety for nothing could be easier
$nastasya$ was continually out of the house especially in the #evening# she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop and always left the #door# ajar
and so when the time came he would only have to go quietly into the kitchen and to take the axe and an hour later when everything was over go in and put it back again
it was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her about but these were doubtful #point# supposing he returned an hour later to put it back and $nastasya$ had come back and was on the spot
but supposing she were in the meantime to miss the axe look for it make an outcry that would mean suspicion or at least grounds for suspicion
he would of course have to go by and wait till she went out again but those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider and indeed he had no time
he was thinking of the chief #point# and put off trifling details until he could believe in it all but that seemed utterly unattainable
so it seemed to himself at least he could not imagine for instance that he would sometime leave off thinking get up and simply go there
even his late experiment i his visit with the object of a final survey of the place was simply an attempt at an experiment far from being the real thing as though one should say come let us go and try it why dream about it and at once he had broken down and had run away cursing in a frenzy with himself
meanwhile it would seem as regards the moral question that his analysis was complete his casuistry had become keen as a razor and he could not find rational objections in himself
but in the last resort he simply ceased to believe in himself and doggedly slavishly sought arguments in all directions fumbling for them as though someone were forcing and drawing him to it
at first long before indeed he had been much occupied with one question why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily detected and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces
he had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions and in his opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime as in the criminal himself
almost every criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a childish and phenomenal heedlessness at the very instant when prudence and caution are most essential
it was his conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will power attacked a #man# like a #disease# developed gradually and reached its highest #point# just before the perpetration of the crime continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after according to the individual case and then passed off like any other #disease#
the question whether the #disease# gives rise to the crime or whether the crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by #something# of the nature of #disease# he did not yet feel able to decide
when he reached these conclusions he decided that in his own case there could not be such a morbid reaction that his reason and will would remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design for the simple reason that his design was not a crime
we will omit all the process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion we have run too far ahead already
we may add only that the practical purely material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his mind
one has but to keep all one will power and reason to deal with them and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business
his final decisions were what he came to trust least and when the hour struck it all came to pass quite differently as it were accidentally and unexpectedly
but this preparation had never been begun one trifling circumstance upset his calculations before he had even left the #staircase#
when he reached the landlady kitchen the #door# of which was open as usual he glanced cautiously in to see whether in $nastasya$ absence the landlady herself was there or if not whether the #door# to her own room was closed so that she might not peep out when he went in for the axe
but what was his amazement when he suddenly saw that $nastasya$ was not only at home in the kitchen but was occupied there taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line
seeing him she left off hanging the clothes turned to him and stared at him all the time he was passing
he turned away his eyes and walked past as though he noticed nothing but it was the #end# of everything he had not the axe
what made me think he reflected as he went under the gateway what made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment
he was overwhelmed why why why did i assume this so certainly he was crushed and even humiliated he could have laughed at himself in his anger
to go into the #street# to go a walk for appearance sake was revolting to go back to his room even more revolting
a dull animal rage boiled within him he stood hesitating in the gateway and what a chance i have lost for ever
he muttered standing aimlessly in the gateway just opposite the porter little dark room which was also open suddenly he started
from the porter room two paces away from him #something# shining under the bench to the right caught his eye he looked about him nobody
he approached the room on tiptoe went down two #step# into it and in a faint voice called the porter
he dashed to the axe it was an axe and pulled it out from under the bench where it lay between two chunks of wood at once before going out he made it fast in the noose he thrust both #hand# into his #pocket# and went out of the room no one had noticed him
yes not at home somewhere near though in the yard for the #door# is wide open when reason fails the devil helps
he #thought# with a strange grin this chance raised his spirits extraordinarily he walked along quietly and sedately without hurry to avoid awakening suspicion
he scarcely looked at the passers by tried to escape looking at their faces at all and to be as little noticeable as possible
suddenly he #thought# of his hat good heavens i had the money the #day# before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead
glancing out of the #corner# of his eye into a shop he saw by a clock on the #wall# that it was ten minutes past seven
he had to make haste and at the same time to go someway round so as to approach the house from the other side
a curse rose from the bottom of his soul when he had happened to imagine all this beforehand he had sometimes #thought# that he would be very much afraid
but he was not very much afraid now was not afraid at all indeed his mind was even occupied by irrelevant matters but by nothing for long
as he passed the yusupov garden he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great fountains and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all the squares
by degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer garden were extended to the field of mars and perhaps joined to the garden of the mihailovsky palace it would be a splendid thing and a great benefit to the town
then he was interested by the question why in all great towns #man# are not simply driven by necessity but in some peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there are no gardens nor fountains where there is most dirt and smell and all sorts of nastiness
then his own walks through the hay market came back to his mind and for a moment he waked up to reality
so probably #man# led to execution clutch mentally at every object that meets them on the way flashed through his mind but simply flashed like lightning he made haste to dismiss this #thought#
what nonsense he #thought# better think of nothing at all and by now he was near here was the house here was the gate
suddenly a clock somewhere struck once what can it be half past seven impossible it must be fast luckily for him everything went well again at the gates
at that very moment as though expressly for his benefit a huge waggon of hay had just driven in at the gate completely screening him as he passed under the gateway and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into the yard before he had slipped in a flash to the right
on the other side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling but no one noticed him and no one met him
many windows looking into that huge quadrangular yard were open at that moment but he did not raise his #head# he had not the strength to
the #staircase# leading to the old woman room was close by just on the right of the gateway he was already on the stairs
drawing a breath pressing his #hand# against his throbbing heart and once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight he began softly and cautiously ascending the stairs listening every minute
one flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were at work in it but they did not glance at him
but the stairs too were quite deserted all the #door# were shut he met no one he stood still #thought# a minute and went on
of course it would be better if they had not been here but it two storeys above them and there was the fourth storey here was the #door# here was the flat opposite the empty one
the flat underneath the old woman was apparently empty also the visiting card nailed on the #door# had been torn off they had gone away
he was out of breath for one instant the #thought# floated through his mind shall i go back but he made no answer and began listening at the old woman #door# a dead silence
then he listened again on the #staircase# listened long and intently then looked about him for the last time pulled himself together drew himself up and once more tried the axe in the noose
am i very pale he wondered am i not evidently agitated she is mistrustful had i better wait a little longer till my heart leaves off thumping
but his heart did not leave off on the contrary as though to #spite# him it throbbed more and more violently
he could stand it no longer he slowly put out his #hand# to the bell and rang half a minute later he rang again more loudly
no answer to go on ringing was useless and out of place the old woman was of course at home but she was suspicious and alone
he had some knowledge of her habits and once more he put his ear to the #door# either his senses were peculiarly keen which it is difficult to suppose or the sound was really very distinct
anyway he suddenly heard #something# like the cautious touch of a #hand# on the lock and the rustle of a skirt at the very #door#
someone was standing stealthily close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly listening within and seemed to have her ear to the #door#
he moved a little on purpose and muttered #something# aloud that he might not have the appearance of hiding then rang a third time but quietly soberly and without impatience recalling it afterwards that moment stood out in his mind vividly distinctly for ever he could not make out how he had had such cunning for his mind was as it were clouded at moments
the #door# was as before opened a tiny crack and again two sharp and suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness
and he was almost unconscious of his body an instant later he heard the latch unfastened chapter vii then $mr_raskolnikov$ lost his #head# and nearly made a great mistake
fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone and not hoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions he took hold of the #door# and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from attempting to shut it again
seeing this she did not pull the #door# back but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with it on to the stairs
she stepped back in alarm tried to say #something# but seemed unable to speak and stared with open eyes at him
good #evening# alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ he began trying to speak easily but his voice would not obey him it broke and shook
seeing that she was standing in the doorway not allowing him to pass he advanced straight upon her i have come
i have brought #something# but we better come in to the light and leaving her he passed straight into the room uninvited
the old woman ran after him her tongue was unloosed good heavens what it is who is it what do you want
why alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ you know me $mr_raskolnikov$ here i brought you the pledge i promised the other #day# and he held out the pledge
the old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge but at once stared in the eyes of her uninvited visitor
she looked intently maliciously and mistrustfully a minute passed he even fancied #something# like a sneer in her eyes as though she had already guessed everything
he felt that he was losing his #head# that he was almost frightened so frightened that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half minute he #thought# he would have run away from her
why do you look at me as though you did not know me he said suddenly also with malice
take it if you like if not i ll go elsewhere i am in a hurry he had not even #thought# of saying this but it was suddenly said of itself
the old woman recovered herself and her visitor resolute tone evidently restored her confidence but why my good sir all of a minute
what is it she asked looking at the pledge the silver cigarette case i spoke of it last time you know
she held out her #hand# but how pale you are to be sure and your #hand# are trembling too
have you been bathing or what fever he answered abruptly you cant help getting pale if you ve nothing to eat he added with difficulty articulating the words
his strength was failing him again but his answer sounded like the truth the old woman took the pledge what is it
she asked once more scanning $mr_raskolnikov$ intently and weighing the pledge in her #hand# a thing cigarette case silver
trying to untie the string and turning to the window to the light all her windows were shut in #spite# of the stifling heat she left him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him
he unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose but did not yet take it out altogether simply holding it in his right #hand# under the coat
look at it it does not seem somehow like silver how he has wrapped it up his #hand# were fearfully weak he felt them every moment growing more numb and more wooden
he was afraid he would let the axe slip and fall a sudden giddiness came over him but what has he tied it up like this for
he pulled the axe quite out swung it with both arms scarcely conscious of himself and almost without effort almost mechanically brought the blunt side down on her #head#
the old woman cried with vexation and moved towards him he had not a minute more to lose he seemed not to use his own strength in this
but as soon as he had once brought the axe down his strength returned to him the old woman was as always bareheaded
her thin light hair streaked with grey thickly smeared with grease was plaited in a rat tail and fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck
she cried out but very faintly and suddenly sank all of a heap on the floor raising her #hand# to her #head#
as she was so short the blow fell on the very top of her skull in one #hand# she still held the pledge
then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side and on the same spot the blood gushed as from an overturned glass the body fell back
her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively
he laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her #pocket# trying to avoid the streaming body the same right #hand# #pocket# from which she had taken the key on his last visit
he stepped back let it fall and at once bent over her face she was dead he was in full possession of his faculties free from #confusion# or giddiness but his #hand# were still trembling
he remembered afterwards that he had been particularly collected and careful trying all the time not to get smeared with blood
he pulled out the keys at once they were all as before in one bunch on a steel ring he ran at once into the bedroom with them
it was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images against the other #wall# stood a big bed very clean and covered with a silk patchwork wadded quilt
strange to say so soon as he began to #fit# the keys into the chest so soon as he heard their jingling a convulsive shudder passed over him
against a third #wall# was a chest of drawers he suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go away
but that was only for an instant it was too late to go back he positively smiled at himself when suddenly another terrifying idea occurred to his mind
leaving the keys in the chest he ran back to the body snatched up the axe and lifted it once more over the old woman but did not bring it down
he suddenly fancied that the old woman might be still alive and might recover her senses there was no doubt that she was dead
bending down and examining her again more closely he saw clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side
he was about to feel it with his finger but drew back his #hand# and indeed it was evident without that
all at once he noticed a string on her neck he tugged at it but the string was strong and did not snap and besides it was soaked with blood
meanwhile there was a perfect pool of blood he tried to pull it out from the front of the dress but #something# held it and prevented its coming
in his impatience he raised the axe again to cut the string from above on the body but did not dare and with difficulty smearing his #hand# and the axe in the blood after two minutes hurried effort he cut the string and took it off without touching the body with the axe
on the string were two crosses one of cyprus wood and one of copper and an image in silver filigree and with them a small greasy chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring
the purse was stuffed very full $mr_raskolnikov$ thrust it in his #pocket# without looking at it flung the crosses on the old woman body and rushed back into the bedroom this time taking the axe with him
he was not mistaken it was a purse he was in terrible haste he snatched the keys and began trying them again
it was not so much that his #hand# were shaking but that he kept making mistakes though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one and would not #fit# still he tried to put it in
suddenly he remembered and realised that the big key with the deep notches which was hanging there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of drawers on his last visit this had struck him but to some strong box and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box
he left the chest of drawers and at once felt under the bedstead knowing that old women usually keep boxes under their beds
there was a good sized box under the bed at least a yard in length with an arched lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails
but he was unsuccessful they would not #fit# in the locks and so it was the notched key fitted at once and unlocked it
at the top under a white sheet was a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin under it was a silk dress then a shawl
and it seemed as though there was nothing below but clothes the first thing he did was to wipe his blood stained #hand# on the red brocade
it red and on red blood will be less noticeable the #thought# passed through his mind then he suddenly came to himself
good god am i going out of my senses he #thought# with terror but no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from under the fur coat
there turned out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes probably all pledges unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed bracelets chains ear rings pins and such things
he made haste to turn them all over some were in cases others simply wrapped in newspaper carefully and exactly folded and tied round with tape
without any delay he began filling up the #pocket# of his trousers and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases but he had not time to take many
he suddenly heard #step# in the room where the old woman lay he stopped short and was still as death but all was quiet so it must have been his fancy
all at once he heard distinctly a faint cry as though someone had uttered a low broken moan then again dead silence for a minute or two
he sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited holding his breath suddenly he jumped up seized the axe and ran out of the bedroom
she was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister white as a sheet and seeming not to have the strength to cry out
seeing him run out of the bedroom she began faintly quivering all over like a leaf a shudder ran down her face she lifted her #hand# opened her mouth but still did not scream
she began slowly backing away from him into the #corner# staring intently persistently at him but still uttered no sound as though she could not get breath to scream
he rushed at her with the axe her mouth twitched piteously as one sees babies mouths when they begin to be frightened stare intently at what frightens them and are on the #point# of screaming
and this hapless $lizaveta_ivanovna$ was so simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not even raise a #hand# to guard her face though that was the most necessary and natural action at the moment for the axe was raised over her face
she only put up her empty left #hand# but not to her face slowly holding it out before her as though motioning him away
the axe fell with the sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the #head#
in the middle of the room stood $lizaveta_ivanovna$ with a big bundle in her arms she fell heavily at once $mr_raskolnikov$ completely lost his #head# snatching up her bundle dropped it again and ran into the entry
fear gained more and more mastery over him especially after this second quite unexpected murder he longed to run away from the place as fast as possible
and if at that moment he had been capable of seeing and reasoning more correctly if he had been able to realise all the difficulties of his position the hopelessness the hideousness and the absurdity of it if he could have understood how many obstacles and perhaps crimes he had still to overcome or to commit to get out of that place and to make his way home it is very possible that he would have flung up everything and would have gone to give himself up and not from fear but from simple horror and loathing of what he had done
the feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew stronger every minute he would not now have gone to the box or even into the room for anything in the world
but a sort of blankness even dreaminess had begun by degrees to take possession of him at moments he forgot himself or rather forgot what was of importance and caught at trifles
glancing however into the kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench he bethought him of washing his #hand# and the axe
he dropped the axe with the blade in the water snatched a piece of soap that lay in a broken saucer on the window and began washing his #hand# in the bucket
when they were clean he took out the axe washed the blade and spent a long time about three minutes washing the wood where there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap
his #hand# were sticky with blood then he wiped it all with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen
and then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window there was no trace left on it only the wood was still damp
then as far as was possible in the dim light in the kitchen he looked over his overcoat his trousers and his boots
he carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat at the first glance there seemed to be nothing but stains on the boots
he wetted the rag and rubbed the boots but he knew he was not looking thoroughly that there might be #something# quite noticeable that he was overlooking
dark agonising ideas rose in his mind the idea that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning of protecting himself that he ought perhaps to be doing #something# utterly different from what he was now doing
he stood in the middle of the room lost in #thought# good god he muttered i must fly fly and he rushed into the entry
he stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes the #door# the outer #door# from the stairs at which he had not long before waited and rung was standing unfastened and at least six inches open
but here a shock of terror awaited him such as he had never known before no lock no bolt all the time all that time
the old woman had not shut it after him perhaps as a precaution but good god why he had seen $lizaveta_ivanovna$ afterwards
and how could he how could he have failed to reflect that she must have come in somehow she could not have come through the #wall#
he dashed to the #door# and fastened the latch but no the wrong thing again i must get away get away
he unfastened the latch opened the #door# and began listening on the #staircase# he listened a long time somewhere far away it might be in the gateway two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting quarrelling and scolding
what are they about he waited patiently at last all was still as though suddenly cut off they had separated
he was meaning to go out but suddenly on the floor below a #door# was noisily opened and someone began going downstairs humming a tune
how is it they all make such a noise flashed through his mind once more he closed the #door# and waited
at last all was still not a soul stirring he was just taking a #step# towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps
the #step# sounded very far off at the very bottom of the stairs but he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming there to the fourth floor to the old woman
why were the sounds somehow peculiar significant the #step# were heavy even and unhurried now he had passed the first floor now he was mounting higher it was growing more and more distinct
and it seemed to him all at once that he was turned to stone that it was like a dream in which one is being pursued nearly caught and will be killed and is rooted to the spot and cannot even move one arms
at last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor he suddenly started and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the flat and closing the #door# behind him
he could hear his heavy breathing and now the third storey had been reached coming here then he took the hook and softly noiselessly fixed it in the catch
instinct helped him when he had done this he crouched holding his breath by the #door# the unknown visitor was by now also at the #door#
they were now standing opposite one another as he had just before been standing with the old woman when the #door# divided them and he was listening
the visitor panted several times he must be a big fat #man# #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$ squeezing the axe in his #hand#
it seemed like a dream indeed the visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly as soon as the tin bell tinkled $mr_raskolnikov$ seemed to be aware of #something# moving in the room
for some seconds he listened quite seriously the unknown rang again waited and suddenly tugged violently and impatiently at the handle of the #door#
$mr_raskolnikov$ gazed in horror at the hook shaking in its fastening and in blank terror expected every minute that the fastening would be pulled out
it certainly did seem possible so violently was he shaking it he was tempted to hold the fastening but he might be aware of it
a giddiness came over him again i shall fall down flashed through his mind but the unknown began to speak and he recovered himself at once
what up are they asleep or murdered damn them he bawled in a thick voice hey alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ old witch
$lizaveta_ivanovna$ $katerina_ivanovna$ hey my beauty open the #door# oh damn them are they asleep or what and again enraged he tugged with all his might a dozen times at the bell
he must certainly be a #man# of authority and an intimate acquaintance at this moment light hurried #step# were heard not far off on the stairs
you dont say there no one at home the new comer cried in a cheerful ringing voice addressing the first visitor who still went on pulling the bell
someone else was approaching $mr_raskolnikov$ had not heard them at first good #evening# $koch$ from his voice he must be quite young #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$
who the devil can tell i ve almost broken the lock answered $koch$ but how do you come to know me
why the #day# before yesterday i beat you three times running at billiards at gambrinus oh so they are not at home
that queer it awfully stupid though where could the old woman have gone i ve come on business yes and i have business with her too
well what can we do go back i suppose aie aie and i was hoping to get some money cried the young #man#
we must give it up of course but what did she fix this time for the old witch fixed the time for me to come herself
she sits here from year #end# to year #end# the old hag her legs are bad and yet here all of a sudden she is out for a walk
it out of my way and where the devil she can have got to i cant make out hadnt we better ask the porter
what where she gone and when she ll be back hm damn it all we might ask but you know she never does go anywhere
and he once more tugged at the #door# handle damn it all there nothing to be done we must go
stay cried the young #man# suddenly do you see how the #door# shakes if you pull it well
that shows it not locked but fastened with the hook do you hear how the hook clanks well why dont you see
if they were all out they would have locked the #door# from the outside with the key and not with the hook from inside
that proves that one of them is at home there do you hear how the hook is clanking to fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home dont you see
so there they are sitting inside and dont open the #door# well and so they must be cried $koch$ astonished
what are they about in there and he began furiously shaking the #door# stay cried the young #man# again
dont pull at it there must be #something# wrong here you ve been ringing and pulling at the #door# and still they dont open
so either they ve both fainted or what i tell you what let go fetch the porter let him wake them up
all right both were going down stay you stop here while i run down for the porter
what for well you better all right i studying the law you see it evident vi dent there #something# wrong here
once more he softly touched the bell which gave one tinkle then gently as though reflecting and looking about him began touching the #door# handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once more that it was only fastened by the hook
then puffing and panting he bent down and began looking at the keyhole but the key was in the lock on the inside
the young #man# cried hotly and he ran downstairs $koch$ remained and so nothing could be seen $mr_raskolnikov$ stood keeping tight hold of the axe
while they were knocking and talking together the idea several times occurred to him to #end# it all at once and shout to them through the #door#
now and then he was tempted to swear at them to jeer at them while they could not open the #door#
he was in a sort of delirium he was even making ready to fight when they should come in only make haste was the #thought# that flashed through his mind
but what the devil is he about time was passing one minute and another no one came $koch$ began to be restless
he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his sentry duty he too went down hurrying and thumping with his heavy boots on the stairs
what the devil the #step# died away good heavens what am i to do $mr_raskolnikov$ unfastened the hook opened the #door# there was no sound
abruptly without any #thought# at all he went out closing the #door# as thoroughly as he could and went downstairs he had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice below where could he go
somebody dashed out of a flat below shouting and rather fell than ran down the stairs bawling at the top of his voice
there was nowhere to hide he was just going back to the flat hey there catch the brute mitka
mitka mitka mitka mitka blast him the shout ended in a shriek the last sounds came from the yard all was still
but at the same instant several #man# talking loud and fast began noisily mounting the stairs there were three or four of them
he distinguished the ringing voice of the young #man# hey filled with despair he went straight to meet them feeling come what must
if they stopped him all was lost if they let him pass all was lost too they would remember him they were approaching they were only a flight from him and suddenly deliverance
a few #step# from him on the right there was an empty flat with the #door# wide open the flat on the second floor where the painters had been at work and which as though for his benefit they had just left
the floor had only just been painted in the middle of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes
in one instant he had whisked in at the open #door# and hidden behind the #wall# and only in the nick of time they had already reached the landing
it was they no doubt who had just run down shouting then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor talking loudly
he waited went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs no one was on the stairs nor in the gateway
he knew he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the flat that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked as the #door# had just been fastened that by now they were looking at the bodies that before another minute had passed they would guess and completely realise that the murderer had just been there and had succeeded in hiding somewhere slipping by them and escaping
he passed quickly through the gateway and turned to the left in the #street# they would guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat while they were going upstairs
and meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much though the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away
should he slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown #street# no hopeless should he fling away the axe
should he take a cab hopeless hopeless at last he reached the turning he turned down it more dead than alive
it was less risky because there was a great crowd of people and he was lost in it like a grain of sand
here he was half way to safety and he understood it but all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could scarcely move
perspiration ran down him in drops his neck was all wet my word he has been going it someone shouted at him when he came out on the canal bank
he remembered however that on coming out on to the canal bank he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more conspicuous and he had #thought# of turning back
though he was almost falling from fatigue he went a long way round so as to get home from quite a different direction
he was only dimly conscious of himself now and the farther he went the worse it was he was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his house
and yet he had a very grave problem before him to put it back and to escape observation as far as possible in doing so
he was of course incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to restore the axe at all but to drop it later on in somebody yard
but it all happened fortunately the #door# of the porter room was closed but not locked so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at home
he was already on the #staircase# before he recollected the axe but he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he walked straight to the #door# and opened it
but again the porter was not at home and he succeeded in putting the axe back under the bench and even covering it with the chunk of wood as before
if the porter had asked him what do you want he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe he met no one not a soul afterwards on the way to his room the landlady #door# was shut
when he was in his room he flung himself on the sofa just as he was he did not sleep but sank into blank forgetfulness
scraps and shreds of #thought# were simply swarming in his brain but he could not catch at one he could not rest on one in #spite# of all his efforts
if #anyone# had come into his room then he would have jumped up at once and screamed part ii chapter i
now and then he seemed to wake up and at such moments he noticed that it was far into the night but it did not occur to him to get up
so he lay a very long while at last he noticed that it was beginning to get light he was lying on his back still dazed from his recent oblivion
fearful despairing cries rose shrilly from the #street# sounds which he heard every night indeed under his window after two clock
ah the drunken #man# are coming out of the taverns he #thought# it past two clock and at once he leaped up as though someone had pulled him from the sofa
they woke him up now what past two clock he sat down on the sofa and instantly recollected everything all at once in one flash he recollected everything
a dreadful chill came over him but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in his sleep
for the first moment he #thought# he was going mad now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering so that his teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking
with amazement he gazed at himself and everything in the room around him wondering how he could have come in the night before without fastening the #door# and have flung himself on the sofa without undressing without even taking his hat off
he opened the #door# and began listening everything in the house was asleep it had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow
if #anyone# had come in what would he have #thought# that i drunk but he rushed to the window
there was light enough and he began hurriedly looking himself all over from #head# to foot all his clothes were there no traces
but there was no doing it like that shivering with cold he began taking off everything and looking over again he turned everything over to the last threads and rags and mistrusting himself went through his search three times
but there seemed to be nothing no trace except in one place where some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge of his trousers
suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of the old woman box were still in his #pocket#
he picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed threads there seemed to be nothing more he had not #thought# till then of taking them out and hiding them
he had not even #thought# of them while he was examining his clothes what next instantly he rushed to take them out and fling them on the table
when he had pulled out everything and turned the #pocket# inside out to be sure there was nothing left he carried the whole heap to the #corner#
the paper had come off the bottom of the #wall# and hung there in tatters he began stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper they re in
all out of sight and the purse too he #thought# gleefully getting up and gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever
suddenly he shuddered all over with horror my god he whispered in despair what the matter with me is that hidden
is that the way to hide things he had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide he had only #thought# of money and so had not prepared a hiding place
but now now what am i glad of he #thought# is that hiding things my reason deserting me simply he sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another unbearable #fit# of shivering
mechanically he drew from a chair beside him his old student winter coat which was still warm though almost in rags covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and delirium
not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again
he lost consciousness how could i go to sleep again with nothing done yes yes i have not taken the loop off the armhole
i forgot it forgot a thing like that such a piece of evidence he pulled off the noose hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits among his linen under the pillow
he repeated standing in the middle of the room and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about him again at the floor and everywhere trying to make sure he had not forgotten anything
the conviction that all his faculties even memory and the simplest power of reflection were failing him began to be an insufferable torture
pieces of torn linen couldnt rouse suspicion whatever happened i think not i think not any way surely it isnt beginning already
the frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the floor in the middle of the room where #anyone# coming in would see them
surely it isnt my punishment coming upon me it is what is the matter with me he cried again like one distraught
then a strange idea entered his #head# that perhaps all his clothes were covered with blood that perhaps there were a great many stains but that he did not see them did not notice them because his perceptions were failing were going to pieces
his reason was clouded suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the purse too ah then there must be blood on the #pocket# too for i put the wet purse in my #pocket#
in a flash he had turned the #pocket# inside out and yes there were traces stains on the lining of the #pocket#
so my reason has not quite deserted me so i still have some sense and memory since i guessed it of myself he #thought# triumphantly with a deep sigh of relief it simply the weakness of fever a moment delirium and he tore the whole lining out of the left #pocket# of his trousers
at that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot on the sock which poked out from the boot he fancied there were traces
he flung off his boots traces indeed the tip of the sock was soaked with blood he must have unwarily stepped into that pool
but what am i to do with this now where am i to put the sock and rags and #pocket#
he gathered them all up in his #hand# and stood in the middle of the room in the stove
but they would ransack the stove first of all burn them but what can i burn them with there are no matches even
no better go out and throw it all away somewhere yes better throw it away he repeated sitting down on the sofa again and at once this minute without lingering
but his #head# sank on the pillow instead again the unbearable icy shivering came over him again he drew his coat over him
and for a long while for some hours he was haunted by the impulse to go off somewhere at once this moment and fling it all away so that it may be out of sight and done with at once at once
several times he tried to rise from the sofa but could not he was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his #door#
open do are you dead or alive he keeps sleeping here shouted $nastasya$ banging with her fist on the #door#
for whole #day# together he snoring here like a dog a dog he is too open i tell you it past ten
maybe he not at home said a #man# voice ha that the porter voice what does he want
he jumped up and sat on the sofa the beating of his heart was a positive pain then who can have latched the #door#
retorted $nastasya$ he taken to bolting himself in as if he were worth stealing open you stupid wake up
what do they want why the porter all discovered resist or open come what may he half rose stooped forward and unlatched the #door#
his room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the bed yes the porter and $nastasya$ were standing there
he glanced with a defiant and desperate air at the porter who without a word held out a grey folded paper sealed with bottle wax
$nastasya$ stared at him in a strange way a notice from the office he announced as he gave him the paper
from what office a summons to the police office of course you know which office to the police
what for how can i tell you re sent for so you go the #man# looked at him attentively looked round the room and turned to go away
he downright ill observed $nastasya$ not taking her eyes off him the porter turned his #head# for a moment
he been in a fever since yesterday she added $mr_raskolnikov$ made no response and held the paper in his #hand# without opening it
dont you get up then $nastasya$ went on compassionately seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa
he looked in his right #hand# he held the shreds he had cut from his trousers the sock and the rags of the #pocket#
you re ill and so dont go there no such hurry what have you got there so he had been asleep with them in his #hand#
afterwards reflecting upon it he remembered that half waking up in his fever he had grasped all this tightly in his #hand# and so fallen asleep again
look at the rags he collected and sleeps with them as though he has got hold of a treasure and $nastasya$ went off into her hysterical giggle
far as he was from being capable of rational reflection at that moment he felt that no one would behave like that with a person who was going to be arrested
instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his eyes intently upon her but the police
you better have some tea yes i ll bring it there some left no i going i ll go at once he muttered getting on to his feet
why you ll never get downstairs yes i ll go as you please she followed the porter out at once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags
there are stains but not very noticeable all covered with dirt and rubbed and already discoloured no one who had no suspicion could distinguish anything
then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began reading he was a long while reading before he understood
it was an ordinary summons from the district police station to appear that #day# at half past nine at the office of the district superintendent
$nastasya$ from a distance could not have noticed thank god but when has such a thing happened i never have anything to do with the police
he was flinging himself on his knees to pray but broke into laughter not at the idea of prayer but at himself
and why just to #day# he #thought# in agonising bewilderment good god only get it over soon he began hurriedly dressing
if i lost i am lost i dont care shall i put the sock on he suddenly wondered it will get dustier still and the traces will be gone
he pulled it off but reflecting that he had no other socks he picked it up and put it on again and again he laughed
that all conventional that all relative merely a way of looking at it he #thought# in a flash but only on the top surface of his mind while he was shuddering all over there i ve got it on
but no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing and horror i have finished by getting it on
but his laughter was quickly followed by despair no it too much for me he #thought# his legs shook
they want to decoy me there and confound me over everything he mused as he went out on to the stairs the worst of it
from fear he muttered his #head# swam and ached with fever it a trick is i almost light headed i may blurt out #something# stupid
on the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as they were in the hole in the #wall# and very likely it on purpose to search when i out he #thought# and stopped short
but he was possessed by such despair such cynicism of #misery# if one may so call it that with a wave of his #hand# he went on
only to get it over in the #street# the heat was insufferable again not a drop of rain had fallen all those #day#
again dust bricks and mortar again the stench from the shops and pot houses again the drunken #man# the finnish pedlars and half broken down cabs
the sun shone straight in his eyes so that it hurt him to look out of them and he felt his #head# going round as a #man# in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the #street# on a bright sunny #day#
when he reached the turning into the #street# in an #agony# of trepidation he looked down it at the house and at once averted his eyes
if they question me perhaps i ll simply tell he #thought# as he drew near the police station the police station was about a quarter of a mile off
it had lately been moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house he had been once for a moment in the old office but long ago
turning in at the gateway he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with a book in his #hand#
a house porter no doubt so then the office is here and he began ascending the stairs on the chance he did not want to ask questions of #anyone#
i ll go in fall on my knees and confess everything he #thought# as he reached the fourth floor the #staircase# was steep narrow and all sloppy with dirty water
the kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost the whole #day# so there was a fearful smell and heat
the #staircase# was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their arms policemen and persons of all sorts and both sexes
there too the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms
the #door# of the office too stood wide open peasants stood waiting within after waiting a little he decided to move forward into the next room
all the rooms were small and low pitched a fearful impatience drew him on and on no one paid attention to him
in the second room some clerks sat writing dressed hardly better than he was and rather a queer looking set he went up to one of them
what is it he showed the notice he had received you are a student the #man# asked glancing at the notice
yes formerly a student the clerk looked at him but without the slightest interest he was a particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye
there would be no getting anything out of him because he has no interest in anything #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$ go in there to the #head# clerk said the clerk pointing towards the furthest room
he went into that room the fourth in order it was a small room and packed full of people rather better dressed than in the outer rooms
among them were two ladies one poorly dressed in mourning sat at the table opposite the chief clerk writing #something# at his dictation
the other a very stout buxom woman with a purplish red blotchy face excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a saucer was standing on one side apparently waiting for #something#
$mr_raskolnikov$ thrust his notice upon the #head# clerk the latter glanced at it said wait a minute and went on attending to the lady in mourning
he breathed more freely it cant be that by degrees he began to regain confidence he kept urging himself to have courage and be calm
some foolishness some trifling carelessness and i may betray myself hm it a pity there no air here he added it stifling
he was afraid of losing his self control he tried to catch at #something# and fix his mind on it #something# quite irrelevant but he could not succeed in this at all
it makes one #head# dizzier than ever and one mind too he was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil yet the #head# clerk greatly interested him he kept hoping to see through him and guess #something# from his face
he was a very young #man# about two and twenty with a dark mobile face that looked older than his years
he was fashionably dressed and foppish with his hair parted in the middle well combed and pomaded and wore a number of rings on his well scrubbed fingers and a gold chain on his waistcoat
he said a couple of words in french to a foreigner who was in the room and said them fairly correctly
luise $katerina_ivanovna$ you can sit down he said casually to the gaily dressed purple faced lady who was still standing as though not venturing to sit down though there was a chair beside her
her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated about the table like an air balloon and filled almost half the room
ich danke said the latter and softly with a rustle of silk she sank into the chair she smelt of scent
but she was obviously embarrassed at filling half the room and smelling so strongly of scent and though her smile was impudent as well as cringing it betrayed evident uneasiness
all at once with some noise an officer walked in very jauntily with a peculiar swing of his shoulders at each #step#
the lady in mourning had done at last and got up he tossed his cockaded cap on the table and sat down in an easy chair
the small lady positively skipped from her seat on seeing him and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy but the officer took not the smallest notice of her and she did not venture to sit down again in his presence
he had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his face and extremely small features expressive of nothing much except a certain insolence
he looked askance and rather indignantly at $mr_raskolnikov$ he was so very badly dressed and in #spite# of his humiliating position his bearing was by no means in keeping with his clothes
he was the assistant superintendent $mr_raskolnikov$ had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on him so that he felt positively affronted
what do you want he shouted apparently astonished that such a ragged fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance
i was summoned by a notice $mr_raskolnikov$ faltered for the recovery of money due from the student the #head# clerk interfered hurriedly tearing himself from his papers
here and he flung $mr_raskolnikov$ a document and pointed out the place read that money what money #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$ but
then it certainly not that and he trembled with joy he felt sudden intense indescribable relief a load was lifted from his back
and pray what time were you directed to appear sir shouted the assistant superintendent seeming for some unknown reason more and more aggrieved
you are told to come at nine and now it twelve the notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago $mr_raskolnikov$ answered loudly over his shoulder
to his own surprise he too grew suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it and it enough that i have come here ill with fever
kindly refrain from shouting i not shouting i speaking very quietly it you who are shouting at me i a student and allow no one to shout at me
the assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he could only splutter inarticulately he leaped up from his seat
you re in a government office too cried $mr_raskolnikov$ and you re smoking a cigarette as well as shouting so you are showing disrespect to all of us
be silent you are in a government office dont be impudent sir he felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this
the #head# clerk looked at him with a smile the angry assistant superintendent was obviously disconcerted that not your business
he shouted at last with unnatural loudness kindly make the declaration demanded of you show him alexandr grigorievitch there is a complaint against you
you dont pay your debts you re a fine bird but $mr_raskolnikov$ was not listening now he had eagerly clutched at the paper in haste to find an explanation
he read it once and a second time and still did not understand what is this he asked the #head# clerk
you must either pay it with all expenses costs and so on or give a written declaration when you can pay it and at the same time an undertaking not to leave the capital without payment and nor to sell or conceal your property
it is for the recovery of money on an i u a writ the creditor is at liberty to sell your property and proceed against you according to the law
here an i u for a hundred and fifteen #rouble# legally attested and due for payment has been brought us for recovery given by you to the widow of the assessor zarnitsyn nine months ago and paid over by the widow zarnitsyn to one mr tchebarov
but i am not in debt to #anyone# that not our business we therefore summon you hereupon but she is my landlady
the #head# clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion and at the same time with a certain triumph as at a novice under fire for the first time as though he would say well how do you feel now
and what if she is your landlady but what did he care now for an i u for a writ of recovery
was that worth worrying about now was it worth attention even he stood he read he listened he answered he even asked questions himself but all mechanically
the triumphant sense of security of deliverance from overwhelming danger that was what filled his whole soul that moment without #thought# for the future without analysis without suppositions or surmises without doubts and without questioning
it was an instant of full direct purely instinctive joy but at that very moment #something# like a thunderstorm took place in the office
the assistant superintendent still shaken by $mr_raskolnikov$ disrespect still fuming and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity pounced on the unfortunate smart lady who had been gazing at him ever since he came in with an exceedingly silly smile
you shameful hussy he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice the lady in mourning had left the office
what was going on at your house last night eh a disgrace again you re a scandal to the whole #street#
fighting and drinking again do you want the house of correction why i have warned you ten times over that i would not let you off the eleventh
and here you are again again you you the paper fell out of $mr_raskolnikov$ #hand# and he looked wildly at the smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated
but he soon saw what it meant and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal he listened with pleasure so that he longed to laugh and laugh all his nerves were on edge
the #head# clerk was beginning anxiously but stopped short for he knew from #experience# that the enraged assistant could not be stopped except by force
but strange to say the more numerous and violent the terms of abuse became the more amiable she looked and the more seductive the smiles she lavished on the terrible assistant
she moved uneasily and curtsied incessantly waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her word and at last she found it
there was no sort of noise or fighting in my house mr captain she pattered all at once like peas dropping speaking russian confidently though with a strong german accent and no sort of scandal and his honour came drunk and it the whole truth i am telling mr captain and i am not to blame
$ilya_petrovitch$ as for the smart lady at first she positively trembled before the storm mine is an honourable house mr captain and honourable behaviour mr captain and i always always dislike any scandal myself
but he came quite tipsy and asked for three bottles again and then he lifted up one leg and began playing the pianoforte with one foot and that is not at all right in an honourable house and he ganz broke the piano and it was very bad manners indeed
and then i called the porter and karl came and he took karl and hit him in the eye and he hit henriette in the eye too and gave me five slaps on the cheek
and i said so and he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it and it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house mr captain and i screamed
and he opened the window over the canal and stood in the window squealing like a little pig it was a disgrace
and karl pulled him away from the window by his coat and it is true mr captain he tore sein rock
the idea of squealing like a little pig at the window into the #street# fie upon him and then he shouted that #man# muss pay him fifteen #rouble# damages
and i did pay him mr captain five #rouble# for sein rock and he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused all the scandal
i will show you up he said for i can write to all the papers about you then he was an author
yes mr captain and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable house now then enough i have told you already
$ilya_petrovitch$ the #head# clerk repeated significantly the assistant glanced rapidly at him the #head# clerk slightly shook his #head#
so i tell you this most respectable luise $katerina_ivanovna$ and i tell it you for the last time the assistant went on
if there is a scandal in your honourable house once again i will put you yourself in the lock up as it is called in polite society
do you hear so a literary #man# an author took five #rouble# for his coat tail in an honourable house a nice set these authors
and he cast a contemptuous glance at $mr_raskolnikov$ there was a scandal the other #day# in a restaurant too
an author had eaten his dinner and would not pay i ll write a satire on you says he and there was another of them on a steamer
last week used the most disgraceful language to the respectable family of a civil councillor his wife and daughter and there was one of them turned out of a confectioner shop the other #day#
they are like that authors literary #man# students town criers pfoo you get along i shall look in upon you myself one #day#
then you had better be careful do you hear with hurried deference luise $katerina_ivanovna$ fell to curtsying in all directions and so curtsied herself to the #door#
but at the #door# she stumbled backwards against a good looking officer with a fresh open face and splendid thick fair whiskers
luise $katerina_ivanovna$ made haste to curtsy almost to the ground and with mincing little #step# she fluttered out of the office
this was the superintendent of the district himself $nikodim_fomitch$ again thunder and lightning a hurricane said $nikodim_fomitch$ to $ilya_petrovitch$ in a civil and friendly tone
$ilya_petrovitch$ drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance and he walked with some papers to another table with a jaunty swing of his shoulders at each #step#
here if you will kindly look an author or a student has been one at least does not pay his debts has given an i u wont clear out of his room and complaints are constantly being lodged against him and here he has been pleased to make a protest against my smoking in his presence
you are aroused again you are fuming again i heard it on the stairs well what then he behaves like a cad himself and just look at him please
#poverty# is not a vice my #friend# but we know you go off like powder you cant bear a slight i daresay you took offence at #something# and went too far yourself continued $nikodim_fomitch$ turning affably to $mr_raskolnikov$
here the gentleman and very attractive he is but you were wrong there he is a capital fellow i assure you but explosive explosive
he gets hot fires up boils over and no stopping him and then it all over and at the bottom he a heart of gold
his nickname in the regiment was the explosive lieutenant and what a regiment it was too cried $ilya_petrovitch$ much gratified at this agreeable banter though still sulky
$mr_raskolnikov$ had a sudden #desire# to say #something# exceptionally pleasant to them all excuse me captain he began easily suddenly addressing $nikodim_fomitch$ will you enter into my position
i am ready to ask pardon if i have been ill mannered i am a poor student sick and shattered shattered was the word he used by #poverty#
i am not studying because i cannot keep myself now but i shall get money i have a #mother# and sister in the province of
my landlady is a good hearted woman but she is so exasperated at my having lost my lessons and not paying her for the last four months that she does not even send up my dinner
they will send it to me and i will pay and i dont understand this i u at all she is asking me to pay her on this
i u how am i to pay her judge for yourselves but that is not our business you know the #head# clerk was observing
$mr_raskolnikov$ put in again still addressing $nikodim_fomitch$ but trying his best to address $ilya_petrovitch$ also though the latter persistently appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously oblivious of him
yes yes i perfectly agree with you but allow me to explain allow me to explain that i have been living with her for nearly three years and at first at first
for why should i not confess it at the very beginning i promised to marry her daughter it was a verbal promise freely given
she was a girl indeed i liked her though i was not in love with her a youthful affair in fact
that is i mean to say that my landlady gave me credit freely in those #day# and i led a life of
nobody asks you for these personal details sir we ve no time to waste $ilya_petrovitch$ interposed roughly and with a note of triumph but $mr_raskolnikov$ stopped him hotly though he suddenly found it exceedingly difficult to speak
i was very heedless but excuse me excuse me it is for me to explain how it all happened in my turn though i agree with you it is unnecessary
i remained lodging there as before and when my landlady moved into her present quarters she said to me and in a friendly way that she had complete trust in me but still would i not give her an i u for one hundred and fifteen #rouble# all the debt i owed her
she said if only i gave her that she would trust me again as much as i liked and that she would never never those were her own words make use of that i u till i could pay of myself and now when i have lost my lessons and have nothing to eat she takes action against me
but a year ago the girl died of typhus what am i to say to that all these affecting details are no business of ours
you must give a written undertaking but as for your love affairs and all these tragic events we have nothing to do with that
$ilya_petrovitch$ interrupted rudely come now you are harsh muttered $nikodim_fomitch$ sitting down at the table and also beginning to write
he looked a little ashamed write said the #head# clerk to $mr_raskolnikov$ write what the latter asked gruffly
$mr_raskolnikov$ fancied that the #head# clerk treated him more casually and contemptuously after his speech but strange to say he suddenly felt completely indifferent to #anyone# opinion and this revulsion took place in a flash in one instant
if he had cared to think a little he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like that a minute before forcing his feelings upon them
now if the whole room had been filled not with police officers but with those nearest and dearest to him he would not have found one human word for them so empty was his heart
i will dictate to you and where had those feelings come from a gloomy sensation of agonising everlasting solitude and remoteness took conscious form in his soul
it was not the meanness of his sentimental effusions before $ilya_petrovitch$ nor the meanness of the latter triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart
oh what had he to do now with his own baseness with all these petty vanities officers german women debts police offices
if he had been sentenced to be burnt at that moment he would not have stirred would hardly have heard the #sentence# to the #end#
it was not that he understood but he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could never more appeal to these people in the police office with sentimental effusions like his recent outburst or with anything whatever and that if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police officers it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any circumstance of life
and what was most agonising it was more a sensation than a conception or idea a direct sensation the most agonising of all the sensations he had known in his life
the #head# clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration that he could not pay that he undertook to do so at a future date that he would not leave the town nor sell his property and so on
#something# was happening to him entirely new sudden and unknown he had never experienced such a strange and awful sensation
but you cant write you can hardly hold the pen observed the #head# clerk looking with curiosity at $mr_raskolnikov$ are you ill
yes i am giddy go on that all sign it the #head# clerk took the paper and turned to attend to others
$mr_raskolnikov$ gave back the pen but instead of getting up and going away he put his elbows on the table and pressed his #head# in his #hand#
a strange idea suddenly occurred to him to get up at once to go up to $nikodim_fomitch$ and tell him everything that had happened yesterday and then to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole in the #corner#
he felt as if a nail were being driven into his skull the impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat to carry it out
hadnt i better think a minute flashed through his mind no better cast off the burden without thinking
but all at once he stood still rooted to the spot $nikodim_fomitch$ was talking eagerly with $ilya_petrovitch$ and the words reached him
it impossible they ll both be released to begin with the whole #story# contradicts itself why should they have called the porter if it had been their doing
to inform against themselves or as a blind no that would be too cunning besides $pestryakov$ the student was seen at the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in
he was walking with three #friend# who left him only at the gate and he asked the porters to direct him in the presence of the #friend#
as for $koch$ he spent half an hour at the silversmith below before he went up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight
now would he have asked his way if he had been going with such an object now just consider but excuse me how do you explain this contradiction
they state themselves that they knocked and the #door# was locked yet three minutes later when they went up with the porter it turned out the #door# was unfastened
that just it the murderer must have been there and bolted himself in and they have caught him for a certainty if $koch$ had not been an ass and gone to look for the porter too
$koch$ keeps crossing himself and saying if i had been there he would have jumped out and killed me with his axe
he must have seized the interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow he is going to have a thanksgiving service ha ha
and no one saw the murderer they might well not see him the house is a regular noah ark said the #head# clerk who was listening
it clear quite clear $nikodim_fomitch$ repeated warmly no it is anything but clear $ilya_petrovitch$ maintained $mr_raskolnikov$ picked up his hat and walked towards the #door# but he did not reach it
when he recovered consciousness he found himself sitting in a chair supported by someone on the right side while someone else was standing on the left holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water and $nikodim_fomitch$ standing before him looking intently at him
he could hardly hold his pen when he was signing said the #head# clerk settling back in his place and taking up his work again
he got up from the chair what this are you ill $nikodim_fomitch$ asked rather sharply have you been ill long
he had of course come to look at the sick #man# when he fainted but retired at once when he recovered
cried $ilya_petrovitch$ from his place where he too was looking through papers since yesterday muttered $mr_raskolnikov$ in reply
did you go out yesterday yes though you were ill yes at what time about seven and where did you go may i ask
along the #street# short and clear $mr_raskolnikov$ white as a handkerchief had answered sharply jerkily without dropping his black feverish eyes before $ilya_petrovitch$ stare
he can scarcely stand upright and you $nikodim_fomitch$ was beginning no matter $ilya_petrovitch$ pronounced rather peculiarly
$nikodim_fomitch$ would have made some further protest but glancing at the #head# clerk who was looking very hard at him he did not speak
there was a sudden silence it was strange very well then concluded $ilya_petrovitch$ we will not detain you
he caught the sound of eager conversation on his departure and above the rest rose the questioning voice of $nikodim_fomitch$
$mr_raskolnikov$ went out in the #street# his faintness passed off completely a search there will be a search at once he repeated to himself hurrying home
the brutes they suspect his former terror mastered him completely again chapter ii and what if there has been a search already
what if i find them in my room but here was his room nothing and no one in it no one had peeped in
he rushed to the #corner# slipped his #hand# under the paper pulled the things out and lined his #pocket# with them
there were eight articles in all two little boxes with ear rings or #something# of the sort he hardly looked to see then four small leather cases
even $nastasya$ had not touched it but heavens how could he have left all those things in the hole there was a chain too merely wrapped in newspaper and #something# else in newspaper that looked like a decoration
he put them all in the different #pocket# of his overcoat and the remaining #pocket# of his trousers trying to conceal them as much as possible
he took the purse too then he went out of his room leaving the #door# open he walked quickly and resolutely and though he felt shattered he had his senses about him
he was afraid of pursuit he was afraid that in another half hour another quarter of an hour perhaps instructions would be issued for his pursuit and so at all costs he must hide all traces before then
he must clear everything up while he still had some strength some reasoning power left him where was he to go
that had long been settled fling them into the canal and all traces hidden in the water the thing would be at an #end#
so he had decided in the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to get up and go away to make haste and get rid of it all
he wandered along the bank of the ekaterininsky canal for half an hour or more and looked several times at the #step# running down to the water but he could not think of carrying out his plan either rafts stood at the #step# edge and women were washing clothes on them or boats were moored there and people were swarming everywhere
moreover he could be seen and noticed from the banks on all sides it would look suspicious for a #man# to go down on purpose stop and throw #something# into the water
but to get rid of it turned out to be a very difficult task and what if the boxes were to float instead of sinking
even as it was everyone he met seemed to stare and look round as if they had nothing to do but to watch him
and of course they would why is it or can it be my fancy he #thought# at last the #thought# struck him that it might be better to go to the neva
there were not so many people there he would be less observed and it would be more convenient in every way above all it was further off
he wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half hour worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it before
and that half hour he had lost over an irrational plan simply because he had #thought# of it in delirium he had become extremely absent and forgetful and he was aware of it
he certainly must make haste he walked towards the neva along prospect but on the way another idea struck him
would it not be better to go somewhere far off to the islands again and there hide the things in some solitary place in a wood or under a bush and mark the spot perhaps
why to the neva and though he felt incapable of clear judgment the idea seemed to him a sound one
for coming out of prospect towards the square he saw on the left a passage leading between two blank #wall# to a courtyard
on the right #hand# the blank unwhitewashed #wall# of a four storied house stretched far into the court on the left a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for twenty paces into the court and then turned sharply to the left
but he was not destined to go there here was a deserted fenced off place where rubbish of different sorts was lying
at the #end# of the court the #corner# of a low smutty stone shed apparently part of some workshop peeped from behind the hoarding
it was probably a carriage builder or carpenter shed the whole place from the entrance was black with coal dust here would be the place to throw it he #thought#
not seeing #anyone# in the yard he slipped in and at once saw near the gate a sink such as is often put in yards where there are many workmen or cab drivers and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in chalk the time honoured witticism standing here strictly forbidden
this was all the better for there would be nothing suspicious about his going in here i could throw it all in a heap and get away
looking round once more with his #hand# already in his #pocket# he noticed against the outer #wall# between the entrance and the sink a big unhewn stone weighing perhaps sixty pounds
he could hear passers by always numerous in that part but he could not be seen from the entrance unless someone came in from the #street# which might well happen indeed so there was need of haste
he bent down over the stone seized the top of it firmly in both #hand# and using all his strength turned it over
the other side of the #wall# was a #street# under the stone was a small hollow in the ground and he immediately emptied his #pocket# into it
then he seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back so that it was in the same position again though it stood a very little higher
the purse lay at the top and yet the hollow was not filled up but he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot
nothing could be noticed then he went out and turned into the square again an intense almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant as it had in the police office
i have buried my tracks and who who can think of looking under that stone it has been lying there most likely ever since the house was built and will lie as many years more
yes he remembered that he began laughing a thin nervous noiseless laugh and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square
but when he reached the boulevard where two #day# before he had come upon that girl his laughter suddenly ceased
and if it were found who would think of me it is all over no clue and he laughed other ideas crept into his mind
he felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat on which after the girl was gone he had sat and pondered and that it would be hateful too to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had given the twenty copecks
all his ideas now seemed to be circling round some single #point# and he felt that there really was such a #point# and that now now he was left facing that #point# and for the first time indeed during the last two months
damn him he walked looking about him angrily and distractedly damn it all he #thought# suddenly in a #fit# of ungovernable fury
if it has begun then it has begun hang the new life good lord how stupid it is and what lies i told to #day#
how despicably i fawned upon that wretched $ilya_petrovitch$ but that is all folly what do i care for them all and my fawning upon them
it is not that at all it is not that at all suddenly he stopped a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly confounded him
if it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically if i really had a certain and definite object how is it
i did not even glance into the purse and dont know what i had there for which i have undergone these #agony# and have deliberately undertaken this base filthy degrading business
and here i wanted at once to throw into the water the purse together with all the things which i had not seen either
yet he had known it all before and it was not a new question for him even when it was decided in the night without #hesitation# and consideration as though so it must be as though it could not possibly be otherwise
yes he had known it all and understood it all it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel cases out of it
it is because i am very ill he decided grimly at last i have been worrying and fretting myself and i dont know what i am doing
how that yes that was so that was all so yes so it was yesterday and the #day# before yesterday and all this time i have been worrying myself
i shall get well and i shall not worry but what if i dont get well at all good god how sick i am of it all
he walked on without resting he had a terrible longing for some distraction but he did not know what to do what to attempt
a new overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him every moment this was an immeasurable almost physical repulsion for everything surrounding him an obstinate malignant feeling of hatred
all who met him were loathsome to him he loathed their faces their movements their gestures if #anyone# had addressed him he felt that he might have spat at him or bitten him
he stopped suddenly on coming out on the bank of the little neva near the bridge to vassilyevsky ostrov why he lives here in that house he #thought# why i have not come to $mr_razumihin$ of my own accord
here it the same thing over again very interesting to know though have i come on purpose or have i simply walked here by chance
never mind i said the #day# before yesterday that i would go and see him the #day# after well and so i will
besides i really cannot go further now he went up to $mr_razumihin$ room on the fifth floor the latter was at home in his #garret# busily writing at the moment and he opened the #door# himself
it was four months since they had seen each other $mr_razumihin$ was sitting in a ragged dressing gown with slippers on his bare feet unkempt unshaven and unwashed
his face showed surprise is it you he cried he looked his comrade up and down then after a brief pause he whistled
as hard up as all that why brother you ve cut me out he added looking at $mr_raskolnikov$ rags
and when he had sunk down on the american leather sofa which was in even worse condition than his own $mr_razumihin$ saw at once that his visitor was ill
come sit down you are tired i ll be bound why you are seriously ill do you know that
he began feeling his pulse $mr_raskolnikov$ pulled away his #hand# never mind he said i have come for this i have no lessons
i wanted but i dont really want lessons but i say you are delirious you know $mr_razumihin$ observed watching him carefully
as he had mounted the stairs to $mr_razumihin$ he had not realised that he would be meeting his #friend# face to face
now in a flash he knew that what he was least of all disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with #anyone# in the wide world
no i am not $mr_raskolnikov$ got up from the sofa his spleen rose within him he almost choked with rage at himself as soon as he crossed $mr_razumihin$ threshold
good bye he said abruptly and walked to the #door# stop stop you queer fish i dont want to said the other again pulling away his #hand#
then why the devil have you come are you mad or what why this is almost insulting i wont let you go like that
but you who could help to begin because you are kinder than #anyone# cleverer i mean and can judge and now i see that i want nothing
well then i came to you because i know no one do you hear nothing at all no one services
no one sympathy i am by myself alone come that enough leave me alone stay a minute you sweep you are a perfect madman
i have no lessons do you see and i dont care about that but there a bookseller heruvimov and he takes the place of a lesson
as you like for all i care i would not exchange him for five lessons he doing publishing of a #kind# and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they have
the very titles are worth the money you always maintained that i was a fool but by jove my boy there are greater fools than i am
now he is setting up for being advanced not that he has an inkling of anything but of course i encourage him
here are two signatures of the german text in my opinion the crudest charlatanism it discusses the question is woman a human being
heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a contribution to the woman question i am translating it he will expand these two and a half signatures into six we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long and bring it out at half a #rouble#
he pays me six #rouble# the signature it works out to about fifteen #rouble# for the job and i ve had six already in advance
when we have finished this we are going to begin a translation about whales and then some of the dullest scandals out of the second part of les confessions we have marked for translation somebody has told heruvimov that rousseau was a #kind# of radishchev
and of course triumphantly proves that she is it will do you may be sure i dont contradict him hang him
if you would take the german and pens and paper all those are provided and take three #rouble# for as i have had six #rouble# in advance on the whole thing three #rouble# come to you for your share
well would you like to do the second signature of is woman a human being and when you have finished the signature there will be another three #rouble# for you
and please dont think i am doing you a service quite the contrary as soon as you came in i saw how you could help me to begin with i am weak in spelling and secondly i am sometimes utterly adrift in german so that i make it up as i go along for the most part
the only comfort is that it bound to be a change for the better though who can tell maybe it sometimes for the worse
will you take it $mr_raskolnikov$ took the german sheets in silence took the three #rouble# and without a word went out
but when $mr_raskolnikov$ was in the next #street# he turned back mounted the stairs to $mr_razumihin$ again and laying on the table the german article and the three #rouble# went out again still without uttering a word
$mr_razumihin$ gazed after him in astonishment are you raving or what $mr_razumihin$ shouted roused to fury at last
what farce is this you ll drive me crazy too what did you come to see me for damn you i dont want translation muttered $mr_raskolnikov$ from the stairs
then what the devil do you want shouted $mr_razumihin$ from above $mr_raskolnikov$ continued descending the #staircase# in silence hey there
where are you living no answer well confound you then but $mr_raskolnikov$ was already stepping into the #street#
a coachman after shouting at him two or three times gave him a violent lash on the back with his whip for having almost fallen under his horses hoofs
the lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the railing for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle of the bridge in the traffic
on the nikolaevsky bridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant incident he angrily clenched and ground his teeth
he heard laughter of course serves him right a pickpocket i dare say pretending to be drunk for sure and getting under the wheels on purpose and you have to answer for him
but while he stood at the railing still looking angry and bewildered after the retreating carriage and rubbing his back he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his #hand#
it was an elderly woman in a kerchief and goatskin shoes with a girl probably her daughter wearing a hat and carrying a green parasol
it a regular profession that what it is he looked take it my good #man# in christ name
from his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar asking alms in the #street# and the gift of the twenty copecks he doubtless owed to the blow which made them feel sorry for him
he closed his #hand# on the twenty copecks walked on for ten paces and turned facing the neva looking towards the palace
he took it and they passed on it was a piece of twenty copecks the sky was without a cloud and the water was almost bright blue which is so rare in the neva
the cupola of the cathedral which is seen at its best from the bridge about twenty paces from the chapel glittered in the sunlight and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished
the pain from the lash went off and $mr_raskolnikov$ forgot about it one uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely
when he was attending the university he had hundreds of times generally on his way home stood still on this spot gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him
he stood still and gazed long and intently into the distance this spot was especially familiar to him it left him strangely cold this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless
he vividly recalled those old doubts and perplexities and it seemed to him that it was no mere chance that he recalled them now
it struck him as strange and grotesque that he should have stopped at the same spot as before as though he actually imagined he could think the same #thought# be interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him so short a time ago
he wondered every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and mistrusting himself put off finding the explanation of it he felt it almost amusing and yet it wrung his heart
deep down hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him now all his old past his old #thought# his old problems and theories his old impressions and that picture and himself and all all
he felt as though he were flying upwards and everything were vanishing from his sight making an unconscious movement with his #hand# he suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist
he opened his #hand# stared at the coin and with a sweep of his arm flung it into the water then he turned and went home
it seemed to him he had cut himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment #evening# was coming on when he reached home so that he must have been walking about six hours
undressing and quivering like an overdriven horse he lay down on the sofa drew his greatcoat over him and at once sank into oblivion
how and where he came back he did not remember it was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream
good god what a scream such unnatural sounds such howling wailing grinding tears blows and curses he had never heard he could never have imagined such brutality such frenzy
in terror he sat up in bed almost swooning with #agony# but the fighting wailing and cursing grew louder and louder
she was howling shrieking and wailing rapidly hurriedly incoherently so that he could not make out what she was talking about
and then to his intense amazement he caught the voice of his landlady she was beseeching no doubt not to be beaten for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs
the voice of her assailant was so horrible from #spite# and rage that it was almost a croak but he too was saying #something# and just as quickly and indistinctly hurrying and spluttering
all at once $mr_raskolnikov$ trembled he recognised the voice it was the voice of $ilya_petrovitch$ ilya petrovitch here and beating the landlady
he is kicking her banging her #head# against the #step# that clear that can be told from the sounds from the cries and the thuds
he could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys and all the #staircase# he heard voices exclamations knocking #door# banging
how is it is the world topsy turvy but why why and how could it be he repeated thinking seriously that he had gone mad
but no he heard too distinctly and they would come to him then next for no doubt it all about that about yesterday
he would have fastened his #door# with the latch but he could not lift his #hand# besides it would be useless
good god terror gripped his heart like ice tortured him and numbed him but at last all this uproar after continuing about ten minutes began gradually to subside
the landlady was moaning and groaning $ilya_petrovitch$ was still uttering threats and curses but at last he too seemed to be silent and now he could not be heard
can he have gone away good lord yes and now the landlady is going too still weeping and moaning
now the crowd was going from the stairs to their rooms exclaiming disputing calling to one another raising their voices to a shout dropping them to a whisper
and then her #door# slammed there must have been numbers of them almost all the inmates of the block but good god how could it be
he lay for half an hour in such anguish such an intolerable sensation of infinite terror as he had never experienced before
and why why had he come here $mr_raskolnikov$ sank worn out on the sofa but could not close his eyes suddenly a bright light flashed into his room
looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not asleep she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she had brought bread salt a plate a spoon
$nastasya$ came in with a candle and a plate of soup you ve eaten nothing since yesterday i warrant you ve been trudging about all #day# and you re shaking with fever
$nastasya$ what were they beating the landlady for she looked intently at him who beat the landlady just now half an hour ago $ilya_petrovitch$ the assistant superintendent on the stairs
why was he ill treating her like that and why was he here $nastasya$ scrutinised him silent and frowning and her scrutiny lasted a long time
he felt uneasy even frightened at her searching eyes $nastasya$ why dont you speak he said timidly at last in a weak voice
it the blood she answered at last softly as though speaking to herself blood what blood he muttered growing white and turning towards the #wall#
$nastasya$ still looked at him without speaking nobody has been beating the landlady she declared at last in a firm resolute voice
he gazed at her hardly able to breathe i heard it myself i was not asleep i was sitting up he said still more timidly
i listened a long while the assistant superintendent came everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the flats
no one has been here that the blood crying in your ears when there no outlet for it and it gets clotted you begin fancying things
will you eat #something# he made no answer $nastasya$ still stood over him watching him give me #something# to drink
$nastasya$ she went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water he remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling some on his neck
he was not completely unconscious however all the time he was ill he was in a feverish state sometimes delirious sometimes half conscious
sometimes it seemed as though there were a number of people round him they wanted to take him away somewhere there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about him
then he would be alone in the room they had all gone away afraid of him and only now and then opened the #door# a crack to look at him they threatened him plotted #something# together laughed and mocked at him
he remembered $nastasya$ often at his bedside he distinguished another person too whom he seemed to know very well though he could not remember who he was and this fretted him even made him cry
sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month at other times it all seemed part of the same #day#
but of that of that he had no recollection and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten #something# he ought to remember
then followed forgetfulness chapter iii he remembered a great deal afterwards he worried and tormented himself trying to remember moaned flew into a rage or sank into awful intolerable terror
then he struggled to get up would have run away but someone always prevented him by force and he sank back into impotence and forgetfulness
on fine #day# the sun shone into the room at that hour throwing a streak of light on the right #wall# and the #corner# near the #door#
at last he returned to complete consciousness it happened at ten clock in the morning $nastasya$ was standing beside him with another person a complete stranger who was looking at him very inquisitively
he was a young #man# with a beard wearing a full short waisted coat and looked like a messenger the landlady was peeping in at the half opened #door#
$mr_raskolnikov$ sat up who is this $nastasya$ he asked pointing to the young #man# i say he himself again she said
he is himself echoed the #man# concluding that he had returned to his senses the landlady closed the #door# and disappeared
she was a woman of forty not at all bad looking fat and buxom with black eyes and eyebrows good natured from fatness and laziness and absurdly bashful
but at that moment the #door# was flung open and stooping a little as he was so tall $mr_razumihin$ came in
she was always shy and dreaded conversations or discussions who are you he went on addressing the #man#
what a cabin it is he cried i am always knocking my #head# you call this a lodging so you are conscious brother
i ve just heard the news from pashenka he has just come to said $nastasya$ just come to echoed the #man# again with a smile
and who are you $mr_razumihin$ asked suddenly addressing him my name is vrazumihin at your service not $mr_razumihin$ as i am always called but vrazumihin a student and gentleman and he is my #friend#
and who are you i am the messenger from our office from the merchant shelopaev and i ve come on business
please sit down $mr_razumihin$ seated himself on the other side of the table it a good thing you ve come to brother he went on to $mr_raskolnikov$
for the last four #day# you have scarcely eaten or drunk anything we had to give you tea in spoonfuls
i brought $zossimov$ to see you twice you remember $zossimov$ he examined you carefully and said at once it was nothing serious #something# seemed to have gone to your #head#
some nervous nonsense the result of bad feeding he says you have not had enough beer and radish but it nothing much it will pass and you will be all right
$zossimov$ is a first rate fellow he is making quite a name come i wont keep you he said addressing the #man# again
you must know $rodya$ this is the second time they have sent from the office but it was another #man# last time and i talked to him
will you explain what you want who was it came before that was the #day# before yesterday i venture to say if you please sir
that was alexey semyonovitch he is in our office too he was more intelligent than you dont you think so
at your mamma request through afanasy ivanovitch vahrushin of whom i presume you have heard more than once a remittance is sent to you from our office the #man# began addressing $mr_raskolnikov$
if you are in an intelligible condition i ve thirty five #rouble# to remit to you as semyon semyonovitch has received from afanasy ivanovitch at your mamma request instructions to that effect as on previous occasions
yes indeed sir he is of more weight than i am quite so go on do you know him sir
yes i remember vahrushin $mr_raskolnikov$ said dreamily you hear he knows vahrushin cried $mr_razumihin$ he is in an intelligible condition
and i see you are an intelligent #man# too well it always pleasant to hear words of wisdom that the gentleman vahrushin afanasy ivanovitch
and at the request of your mamma who has sent you a remittance once before in the same manner through him he did not refuse this time also and sent instructions to semyon semyonovitch some #day# since to #hand# you thirty five #rouble# in the #hope# of better to come
that hoping for better to come is the best thing you ve said though your mamma is not bad either
come then what do you say is he fully conscious eh that all right if only he can sign this little paper
he can scrawl his name have you got the book yes here the book give it to me here $rodya$ sit up
i ll hold you take the pen and scribble $mr_raskolnikov$ for him for just now brother money is sweeter to us than treacle
i dont want it said $mr_raskolnikov$ pushing away the pen not want it i wont sign it how the devil can you do without signing it
i dont want the money dont want the money come brother that nonsense i bear witness dont trouble please it only that he is on his travels again
you are a #man# of judgment and we will take him in #hand# that is more simply take his #hand# and he will sign it
but that pretty common with him at all times though here but i can come another time no no
now $rodya$ dont keep your visitor you see he is waiting and he made ready to hold $mr_raskolnikov$ #hand# in earnest
why should we trouble you you are a #man# of judgment stop i ll do it alone said the latter taking the pen and signing his name
the messenger took out the money and went away bravo and now brother are you hungry yes answered $mr_raskolnikov$ is there any soup
some of yesterday answered $nastasya$ who was still standing there with potatoes and rice in it yes i know it by heart
bring soup and give us some tea very well $mr_raskolnikov$ looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull unreasoning terror
he made up his mind to keep quiet and see what would happen i believe i am not wandering i believe it reality he #thought#
in a couple of minutes $nastasya$ returned with the soup and announced that the tea would be ready directly with the soup she brought two spoons two plates salt pepper mustard for the beef and so on
the table was set as it had not been for a long time the cloth was clean it would not be amiss $nastasya$ if praskovya pavlovna were to send us up a couple of bottles of beer
we could empty them well you are a cool #hand# muttered $nastasya$ and she departed to carry out his orders
meanwhile $mr_razumihin$ sat down on the sofa beside him as clumsily as a bear put his left arm round $mr_raskolnikov$ #head# although he was able to sit up and with his right #hand# gave him a spoonful of soup blowing on it that it might not burn him
$mr_raskolnikov$ still gazed wildly with strained attention but the soup was only just warm $mr_raskolnikov$ swallowed one spoonful greedily then a second then a third
but after giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup $mr_razumihin$ suddenly stopped and said that he must ask $zossimov$ whether he ought to have more
$nastasya$ came in with two bottles of beer and will you have tea yes cut along $nastasya$ and bring some tea for tea we may venture on without the faculty
he moved back to his chair pulled the soup and meat in front of him and began eating as though he had not touched food for three #day#
i must tell you $rodya$ i dine like this here every #day# now he mumbled with his mouth full of beef and it all pashenka your dear little landlady who sees to that
but here is the beer she loves to do anything for me i dont ask for it but of course i dont object
and here $nastasya$ with the tea she is a quick girl $nastasya$ my dear wont you have some beer get along with your nonsense
a cup of tea then a cup of tea maybe pour it out stay i ll pour it out myself
as before he put his left arm round the sick #man# #head# raised him up and gave him tea in spoonfuls again blowing each spoonful steadily and earnestly as though this process was the principal and most effective means towards his #friend# recovery
$mr_raskolnikov$ said nothing and made no resistance though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon but even perhaps could have walked about
but from some queer almost animal cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying low for a time pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession of his faculties and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on
sit down he poured out two cups left his dinner and sat on the sofa again yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance
after sipping a dozen spoonfuls of tea he suddenly released his #head# pushed the spoon away capriciously and sank back on the pillow
there were actually real pillows under his #head# now down pillows in clean cases he observed that too and took note of it
pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to #day# to make him some raspberry tea said $mr_razumihin$ going back to his chair and attacking his soup and beer again
and where is she to get raspberries for you asked $nastasya$ balancing a saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of sugar
she ll get it at the shop my dear you see $rodya$ all sorts of things have been happening while you have been laid up
when you decamped in that rascally way without leaving your address i felt so angry that i resolved to find you out and punish you
this lodging of yours i had forgotten though i never remembered it indeed because i did not know it and as for your old lodgings i could only remember it was at the five #corner# harlamov house
i set to work that very #day# how i ran about making inquiries for you i kept trying to find that harlamov house and afterwards it turned out that it was not harlamov
but buch how one muddles up sound sometimes so i lost my #temper# and i went on the chance to the address bureau next #day# and only fancy
in two minutes they looked you up your name is down there my name i should think so and yet a general
kobelev they could not find while i was there well it a long #story# but as soon as i did land on this place i soon got to know all your affairs all all
i made the acquaintance of $nikodim_fomitch$ and $ilya_petrovitch$ and the house porter and $mr_zametov$ alexandr grigorievitch the #head# clerk in the police office and last but not least of pashenka $nastasya$ here knows
brother i know everything $nastasya$ here will tell you he got round her $nastasya$ murmured smiling slyly why dont you put the sugar in your tea $nastasya$ nikiforovna
you are a one $nastasya$ cried suddenly going off into a giggle i am not nikiforovna but $marfa_petrovna$ she added suddenly recovering from her mirth
well brother to make a long #story# short i was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant influences in the locality but pashenka won the #day#
i ll make a note of it i had not expected brother to find her so prepossessing eh what do you think
$mr_raskolnikov$ did not speak but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him full of alarm and all that could be wished indeed in every respect $mr_razumihin$ went on not at all embarrassed by his silence
ah the sly dog $nastasya$ shrieked again this conversation afforded her unspeakable delight it a pity brother that you did not set to work in the right way at first
you ought to have approached her differently she is so to speak a most unaccountable character but we will talk about her character later
how could you let things come to such a pass that she gave up sending you your dinner and that i u
you must have been mad to sign an i u and that promise of marriage when her daughter natalya yegorovna was alive
but talking of foolishness do you know praskovya pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as you would think at first sight
i know all about it but i see that a delicate matter and i am an ass forgive me
no mumbled $mr_raskolnikov$ looking away but feeling that it was better to keep up the conversation she isnt is she
cried $mr_razumihin$ delighted to get an answer out of him but she is not very clever either eh she is essentially essentially an unaccountable character
i am sometimes quite at a loss i assure you she must be forty she says she is thirty six and of course she has every right to say so
but i swear i judge her intellectually simply from the metaphysical #point# of view there is a sort of symbolism sprung up between us a sort of algebra or what not
only seeing that you are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes and that through the young lady death she has no need to treat you as a relation she suddenly took fright and as you hid in your den and dropped all your old relations with her she planned to get rid of you
i dont understand it well that all nonsense and she been cherishing that design a long time but was sorry to lose the i u
my #mother# herself is almost a beggar and i told a lie to keep my lodging and be fed $mr_raskolnikov$ said loudly and distinctly
for you assured her yourself that your #mother# would pay it was base of me to say that
yes you did very sensibly but the worst of it is that at that #point# mr tchebarov turns up a business #man#
pashenka would never have #thought# of doing anything on her own account she is too retiring but the business #man# is by no means retiring and first thing he puts the question is there any #hope# of realising the i u
answer there is because he has a #mother# who would save her $rodya$ with her hundred and twenty five #rouble# pension if she has to starve herself and a sister too who would go into bondage for his sake
i know all the ins and outs of your affairs now my dear boy it not for nothing that you were so open with pashenka when you were her prospective son in law and i say all this as a #friend#
but i tell you what it is an honest and sensitive #man# is open and a business #man# listens and goes on eating you up
well then she gave the i u by way of payment to this tchebarov and without #hesitation# he made a formal demand for payment
when i heard of all this i wanted to blow him up too to clear my conscience but by that time harmony reigned between me and pashenka and i insisted on stopping the whole affair engaging that you would pay
we called tchebarov flung him ten #rouble# and got the i u back from him and here i have the honour of presenting it to you
that what he was building upon why do you start i went security for you brother do you understand she trusts your word now
here take it you see i have torn it $mr_razumihin$ put the note on the table $mr_raskolnikov$ looked at him and turned to the #wall# without uttering a word
even $mr_razumihin$ felt a twinge i see brother he said a moment later that i have been playing the fool again
i #thought# i should amuse you with my chatter and i believe i have only made you cross was it you
i did not recognise when i was delirious $mr_raskolnikov$ asked after a moment pause without turning his #head# yes and you flew into a rage about it especially when i brought $mr_zametov$ one #day#
$mr_zametov$ the #head# clerk what for $mr_raskolnikov$ turned round quickly and fixed his eyes on $mr_razumihin$ what the matter with you
what are you upset about he wanted to make your acquaintance because i talked to him a lot about you how could i have found out so much except from him
he is a capital fellow brother first rate in his own way of course now we are #friend# see each other almost every #day#
i have moved into this part you know i have only just moved i ve been with him to luise $katerina_ivanovna$ once or twice
do you remember luise luise $katerina_ivanovna$ did i say anything in delirium i should think so you were beside yourself
what did i rave about what next what did you rave about what people do rave about well brother now i must not lose time
to work he got up from the table and took up his cap what did i rave about how he keeps on
but you said a lot about a bulldog and about ear rings and chains and about krestovsky island and some porter and $nikodim_fomitch$ and $ilya_petrovitch$ the assistant superintendent
are you afraid of having let out some secret dont worry yourself you said nothing about a countess and another thing that was of special interest to you was your own sock
$mr_zametov$ hunted all about your room for your socks and with his own scented ring bedecked fingers he gave you the rag
and only then were you comforted and for the next twenty four hours you held the wretched thing in your #hand# we could not get it from you
you whined give me my sock it is most likely somewhere under your quilt at this moment and then you asked so piteously for fringe for your trousers
here are thirty five #rouble# i take ten of them and shall give you an account of them in an hour or two
i will let $zossimov$ know at the same time though he ought to have been here long ago for it is nearly twelve
and you $nastasya$ look in pretty often while i am away to see whether he wants a drink or anything else
we tried to find out what sort of fringe but we could not make it out now to business and i will tell pashenka what is wanted myself
ah he a deep one said $nastasya$ as he went out then she opened the #door# and stood listening but could not resist running downstairs after him
good bye he calls her pashenka she was very eager to hear what he would say to the landlady she was evidently quite fascinated by $mr_razumihin$
no sooner had she left the room than the sick #man# flung off the bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman
with burning twitching impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to work but to what work
now as though to #spite# him it eluded him good god only tell me one thing do they know of it yet or not
what if they know it and are only pretending mocking me while i am laid up and then they will come in and tell me that it been discovered long ago and that they have only
what am i to do now that what i ve forgotten as though on purpose forgotten it all at once i remembered a minute ago
he stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment about him he walked to the #door# opened it listened but that was not what he wanted
suddenly as though recalling #something# he rushed to the #corner# where there was a hole under the paper began examining it put his #hand# into the hole fumbled but that was not it
he went to the stove opened it and began rummaging in the ashes the frayed edges of his trousers and the rags cut off his #pocket# were lying there just as he had thrown them
yes there it lay on the sofa under the quilt but it was so covered with dust and grime that $mr_zametov$ could not have seen anything on it
no one had looked then then he remembered the sock about which $mr_razumihin$ had just been telling him bah $mr_zametov$
the police office and why am i sent for to the police office where the notice bah i am mixing it up that was then
i looked at my sock then too but now now i have been ill but what did $mr_zametov$ come for why did $mr_razumihin$ bring him
he muttered helplessly sitting on the sofa again what does it mean am i still in delirium or is it real
i believe it is real ah i remember i must escape make haste to escape yes i must i must escape
yes but where and where are my clothes i ve no boots they ve taken them away they ve hidden them i understand ah here is my coat they passed that over
and here is money on the table thank god and here the i u i ll take the money and go and take another lodging
they wont find me yes but the address bureau they ll find me $mr_razumihin$ will find me better escape altogether far away to america and let them do their worst
and take the i u it would be of use there what else shall i take they think i am ill
they dont know that i can walk ha ha ha i could see by their eyes that they know all about it if only i could get downstairs
and what if they have set a watch there policemen what this tea ah and here is beer left half a bottle cold
he snatched up the bottle which still contained a glassful of beer and gulped it down with relish as though quenching a flame in his breast
but in another minute the beer had gone to his #head# and a faint and even pleasant shiver ran down his spine
he lay down and pulled the quilt over him his sick and incoherent #thought# grew more and more disconnected and soon a light pleasant drowsiness came upon him
with a sense of comfort he nestled his #head# into the pillow wrapped more closely about him the soft wadded quilt which had replaced the old ragged greatcoat sighed softly and sank into a deep sound refreshing sleep
he woke up hearing someone come in he opened his eyes and saw $mr_razumihin$ standing in the doorway uncertain whether to come in or not
$mr_raskolnikov$ sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him as though trying to recall #something# ah you are not asleep
here i am $nastasya$ bring in the parcel $mr_razumihin$ shouted down the stairs you shall have the account directly
what time is it asked $mr_raskolnikov$ looking round uneasily yes you had a fine sleep brother it almost #evening# it will be six clock directly
you have slept more than six hours good heavens have i and why not it will do you good
what the hurry a tryst is it we ve all time before us i ve been waiting for the last three hours for you i ve been up twice and found you asleep
i ve called on $zossimov$ twice not at home only fancy but no matter he will turn up and i ve been out on my own business too
you know i ve been moving to #day# moving with my uncle i have an uncle living with me now but that no matter to business
give me the parcel $nastasya$ we will open it directly and how do you feel now brother i am quite well i am not ill
$mr_razumihin$ have you been here long i tell you i ve been waiting for the last three hours no before how do you mean
how long have you been coming here why i told you all about it this morning dont you remember $mr_raskolnikov$ pondered
the morning seemed like a dream to him he could not remember alone and looked inquiringly at $mr_razumihin$ hm said the latter he has forgotten
i fancied then that you were not quite yourself now you are better for your sleep you really look much better
first rate well to business look here my dear boy he began untying the bundle which evidently interested him believe me brother this is #something# specially near my heart
for we must make a #man# of you let begin from the top do you see this cap he said taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and ordinary cap
come $rodya$ my boy dont oppose it afterwards will be too late and i shant sleep all night for i bought it by guess without measure
let me try it on presently afterwards said $mr_raskolnikov$ waving it off pettishly just right he cried triumphantly fitting it on just your size
tolstyakov a #friend# of mine is always obliged to take off his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other people wear their hats or caps
people think he does it from slavish politeness but it simply because he is ashamed of his bird nest he is such a boastful fellow
a proper #head# covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in its own way look $nastasya$ here are two specimens of headgear this palmerston he took from the #corner#
$mr_raskolnikov$ old battered hat which for some unknown reason he called a palmerston or this jewel guess the price $rodya$ what do you suppose i paid for it $nastasya$
he said turning to her seeing that $mr_raskolnikov$ did not speak twenty copecks no more i dare say answered $nastasya$
twenty copecks silly he cried offended why nowadays you would cost more than that eighty copecks and that only because it has been worn
and it bought on condition that when it worn out they will give you another next year yes on my word
i assure you i am proud of these breeches and he exhibited to $mr_raskolnikov$ a pair of light summer trousers of grey woollen material
well now let us pass to the united states of america as they called them at school no holes no spots and quite respectable although a little worn and a waistcoat to match quite in the fashion
you see $rodya$ to my thinking the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the seasons if you dont insist on having asparagus in january you keep your money in your purse and it the same with this purchase
it summer now so i ve been buying summer things warmer materials will be wanted for autumn so you will have to throw these away in any case especially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of coherence if not your higher standard of luxury
and its being worn really is an improvement it softer smoother come price them what do you say two #rouble# twenty five copecks
they only do business on that system at fedyaev if you ve bought a thing once you are satisfied for life for you will never go there again of your own free will
and remember the condition if you wear these out you will have another suit for nothing now for the boots what do you say
you see that they are a bit worn but they ll last a couple of months for it foreign work and foreign leather the secretary of the english embassy sold them last week he had only worn them six #day# but he was very short of cash
price a #rouble# and a half a bargain but perhaps they wont #fit# observed $nastasya$ not #fit# just look and he pulled out of his #pocket# $mr_raskolnikov$ old broken boot stiffly coated with dry mud
i did not go empty handed they took the size from this monster we all did our best and as to your linen your landlady has seen to that
well now then eighty copecks the cap two #rouble# twenty five copecks the suit together three #rouble# five copecks a #rouble# and a half for the boots for you see they are very good and that makes four #rouble# fifty five copecks five #rouble# for the underclothes they were bought in the lo which makes exactly nine #rouble# fifty five copecks
here to begin with are three shirts hempen but with a fashionable front forty five copecks change in coppers will you take it
and so $rodya$ you are set up with a complete new rig out for your overcoat will serve and even has a style of its own
that comes from getting one clothes from sharmer as for your socks and other things i leave them to you we ve twenty five #rouble# left
and as for pashenka and paying for your lodging dont you worry i tell you she ll trust you for anything and now brother let me change your linen for i daresay you will throw off your illness with your shirt
let me be i dont want to $mr_raskolnikov$ waved him off he had listened with disgust to $mr_razumihin$ efforts to be playful about his purchases
come brother dont tell me i ve been trudging around for nothing $mr_razumihin$ insisted $nastasya$ dont be bashful but help me that it and in #spite# of $mr_raskolnikov$ resistance he changed his linen
the latter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing it will be long before i get rid of them he #thought#
what money was all that bought with he asked at last gazing at the #wall# money why your own what the messenger brought from vahrushin your #mother# sent it
have you forgotten that too i remember now said $mr_raskolnikov$ after a long sullen silence $mr_razumihin$ looked at him frowning and uneasy
the #door# opened and a tall stout #man# whose appearance seemed familiar to $mr_raskolnikov$ came in chapter iv $zossimov$ was a tall fat #man# with a puffy colourless clean shaven face and straight flaxen hair
he had on a light grey fashionable loose coat light summer trousers and everything about him loose fashionable and spick and span his linen was irreproachable his watch chain was massive
in manner he was slow and as it were nonchalant and at the same time studiously free and easy he made efforts to conceal his self importance but it was apparent at every instant
he wore spectacles and a big gold ring on his fat finger he was twenty seven all his acquaintances found him tedious but said he was clever at his work
i see i see and how do we feel now eh said $zossimov$ to $mr_raskolnikov$ watching him carefully and sitting down at the foot of the sofa he settled himself as comfortably as he could
i ve been to you twice to #day# brother you see he come to himself cried $mr_razumihin$ he is still depressed $mr_razumihin$ went on
we ve just changed his linen and he almost cried that very natural you might have put it off if he did not wish it
his pulse is first rate is your #head# still aching eh i am well i am perfectly well $mr_raskolnikov$ declared positively and irritably
he raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with glittering eyes but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to the #wall#
$zossimov$ watched him intently very good going on all right he said lazily has he eaten anything they told him and asked what he might have
he may have anything soup tea mushrooms and cucumbers of course you must not give him he better not have meat either and but no need to tell you that
$mr_razumihin$ and he looked at each other no more medicine or anything i ll look at him again to morrow
perhaps to #day# even but never mind to morrow #evening# i shall take him for a walk said $mr_razumihin$ we are going to the yusupov garden and then to the palais de crystal
i would not disturb him to morrow at all but i dont know a little maybe but we ll see ach what a nuisance
i ve got a house warming party to night it only a #step# from here couldnt he come he could lie on the sofa
you are coming $mr_razumihin$ said to $zossimov$ dont forget you promised all right only rather later what are you going to do
all neighbours here almost all new #friend# except my old uncle and he is new too he only arrived in petersburg yesterday to see to some business of his
oh nothing tea vodka herrings there will be a pie just our #friend# and who we meet once in five years
what is he he been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster gets a little pension he is sixty five not worth talking about
but i am fond of him $porfiry_petrovitch$ the #head# of the investigation department here but you know him is he a relation of yours too
a very distant one but why are you scowling because you quarrelled once wont you come then i dont care a damn for him
so much the better well there will be some students a teacher a government clerk a musician an officer and $mr_zametov$
do tell me please what you or he $zossimov$ nodded at $mr_raskolnikov$ can have in common with this $mr_zametov$ oh you particular gentleman
principles you are worked by principles as it were by springs you wont venture to turn round on your own account
if a #man# is a nice fellow that the only principle i go upon $mr_zametov$ is a delightful person though he does take bribes
well he does and what of it i dont care if he does take bribes $mr_razumihin$ cried with unnatural irritability
i dont praise him for taking bribes i only say he is a nice #man# in his own way but if one looks at #man# in all ways are there many good ones left
why i am sure i shouldnt be worth a baked onion myself perhaps with you thrown in that too little i give two for you
and i wouldnt give more than one for you no more of your jokes $mr_zametov$ is no more than a boy
i can pull his hair and one must draw him not repel him you ll never improve a #man# by repelling him especially a boy
one has to be twice as careful with a boy oh you progressive dullards you dont understand you harm yourselves running another #man# down
but if you want to know we really have #something# in common i should like to know what why it all about a house painter
we are getting him out of a mess though indeed there nothing to fear now the matter is absolutely self evident we only put on steam
a painter why havent i told you about it i only told you the beginning then about the murder of the old pawnbroker woman
well the painter is mixed up in it oh i heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it partly for one reason
i read about it in the papers too $lizaveta_ivanovna$ was murdered too $nastasya$ blurted out suddenly addressing $mr_raskolnikov$ she remained in the room all the time standing by the #door# listening
$lizaveta_ivanovna$ murmured $mr_raskolnikov$ hardly audibly $lizaveta_ivanovna$ who sold old clothes didnt you know her she used to come here
$mr_raskolnikov$ turned to the #wall# where in the dirty yellow paper he picked out one clumsy white flower with brown lines on it and began examining how many petals there were in it how many scallops in the petals and how many lines on them
she mended a shirt for you too he felt his arms and legs as lifeless as though they had been cut off
he did not attempt to move but stared obstinately at the flower but what about the painter $zossimov$ interrupted $nastasya$ chatter with marked displeasure
she sighed and was silent why he was accused of the murder $mr_razumihin$ went on hotly was there evidence against him then
evidence indeed evidence that was no evidence and that what we have to prove it was just as they pitched on those fellows $koch$ and $pestryakov$ at first
by the way $rodya$ you ve heard about the business already it happened before you were ill the #day# before you fainted at the police office while they were talking about it
foo how stupidly it all done it makes one sick though it not one business $pestryakov$ may be coming to night
$zossimov$ looked curiously at $mr_raskolnikov$ he did not stir but i say $mr_razumihin$ i wonder at you what a busybody you are
$zossimov$ observed maybe i am but we will get him off anyway shouted $mr_razumihin$ bringing his fist down on the table
what the most offensive is not their lying one can always forgive lying lying is a delightful thing for it leads to truth
what is offensive is that they lie and worship their own lying i respect $porfiry_petrovitch$ but what threw them out at first
the #door# was locked and when they came back with the porter it was open so it followed that $koch$ and $pestryakov$ were the murderers that was their logic
but dont excite yourself they simply detained them they could not help that and by the way i ve met that #man# $koch$
he used to buy unredeemed pledges from the old woman eh yes he is a swindler he buys up bad debts too
he makes a profession of it but enough of him do you know what makes me angry it their sickening rotten petrified routine
and this case might be the means of introducing a new method one can show from the psychological data alone how to get on the track of the real #man#
we have facts they say but facts are not everything at least half the business lies in how you interpret them can you interpret them then
anyway one cant hold one tongue when one has a feeling a tangible feeling that one might be a help if only
eh do you know the details of the case i am waiting to hear about the painter oh yes well here the #story#
early on the third #day# after the murder when they were still dandling $koch$ and $pestryakov$ though they accounted for every #step# they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff an unexpected fact turned up
a peasant called dushkin who keeps a dram shop facing the house brought to the police office a jeweller case containing some gold ear rings and told a long rigamarole
the #day# before yesterday just after eight clock mark the #day# and the hour a journeyman house painter $nikolay$ who had been in to see me already that #day# brought me this box of gold ear rings and stones and asked me to give him two #rouble# for them
when i asked him where he got them he said that he picked them up in the #street# i did not ask him anything more
i gave him a note a #rouble# that is for i #thought# if he did not pawn it with me he would with another
i am telling you dushkin #story# it would all come to the same thing he spend it on drink so the thing had better be with me
the quicker you will find it and if anything turns up if i hear any rumours i ll take it to the police
for i know this dushkin he is a pawnbroker and a receiver of stolen goods and he did not cheat $nikolay$ out of a thirty #rouble# trinket in order to give it to the police
the further you hide it of course that all taradiddle he lies like a horse he was simply afraid but no matter to return to dushkin #story#
i ve known this peasant $nikolay$ dementyev from a #child# he comes from the same province and district of zaraïsk we are both ryazan #man#
and though $nikolay$ is not a drunkard he drinks and i knew he had a job in that house painting work with $dmitri_prokofitch$ who comes from the same village too
as soon as he got the #rouble# he changed it had a couple of glasses took his change and went out
but i did not see $dmitri_prokofitch$ with him then and the next #day# i heard that someone had murdered alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ and her sister $lizaveta_ivanovna$ $katerina_ivanovna$ with an axe
i knew them and i felt suspicious about the ear rings at once for i knew the murdered woman lent money on pledges
i went to the house and began to make careful inquiries without saying a word to #anyone# first of all i asked is $nikolay$ here
$dmitri_prokofitch$ told me that $nikolay$ had gone off on the spree he had come home at daybreak drunk stayed in the house about ten minutes and went out again
$dmitri_prokofitch$ didnt see him again and is finishing the job alone and their job is on the same #staircase# as the murder on the second floor
when i heard all that i did not say a word to #anyone# that dushkin tale but i found out what i could about the murder and went home feeling as suspicious as ever
and at eight clock this morning that was the third #day# you understand i saw $nikolay$ coming in not sober though not to say very drunk he could understand what was said to him
he sat down on the bench and did not speak there was only one stranger in the bar and a #man#
i knew asleep on a bench and our two boys have you seen $dmitri_prokofitch$ said i no i havent said he
and you ve not been here either not since the #day# before yesterday said he and where did you sleep last night
i found them in the #street# and the way he said it was a bit queer he did not look at me
did you hear what happened that very #evening# at that very hour on that same #staircase# said i no said he i had not heard and all the while he was listening his eyes were staring out of his #head#
in peski with the kolomensky #man# and where did you get those ear rings i asked and he turned as white as chalk
i told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up i wanted to keep him
and i signed to the boy to hold the #door# and i came out from behind the bar but he darted out and down the #street# to the turning at a run
wait a bit $nikolay$ said i wont you have a drink i have not seen him since then my doubts were at an #end# it was his doing as clear as could be
of course they sought high and low for $nikolay$ they detained dushkin and searched his house $dmitri_prokofitch$ too was arrested the kolomensky #man# also were turned inside out
i should think so said $zossimov$ wait hear the #end# and the #day# before yesterday they arrested $nikolay$ in a tavern at the #end# of the town
he had gone there taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram for it they gave it to him
a few minutes afterwards the woman went to the cowshed and through a crack in the #wall# she saw in the stable adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam stood on a block of wood and was trying to put his neck in the noose
the woman screeched her hardest people ran in so that what you are up to take me he says to such and such a police officer i ll confess everything
well they took him to that police station that is here with a suitable escort so they asked him this and that how old he is twenty two and so on
at the question when you were working with $dmitri_prokofitch$ didnt you see #anyone# on the #staircase# at such and such a time answer to be sure folks may have gone up and down but i did not notice them
and did you hear $nikolay$ that on the same #day# widow so and so and her sister were murdered and robbed i never knew a thing about it
and didnt you hear anything any noise and so on we heard nothing special the first i heard of it was from afanasy pavlovitch the #day# before yesterday
and where did you find the ear rings i found them on the pavement why didnt you go to work with $dmitri_prokofitch$ the other #day#
oh in such and such a place why did you run away from dushkin because i was awfully frightened what were you frightened of
because i was drinking and where were you drinking that i should be accused how could you be frightened if you felt free from guilt
now $zossimov$ you may not believe me that question was put literally in those words i know it for a fact it was repeated to me exactly
what do you say to that well anyway there the evidence i am not talking of the evidence now i am talking about that question of their own idea of themselves
well so they squeezed and squeezed him and he confessed i did not find it in the #street# but in the flat where i was painting with $dmitri_prokofitch$
why $dmitri_prokofitch$ and i were painting there all #day# and we were just getting ready to go and $dmitri_prokofitch$ took a brush and painted my face and he ran off
i ran after him shouting my hardest and at the bottom of the stairs i ran right against the porter and some gentlemen and how many gentlemen were there
and the porter swore at me and the other porter swore too and the porter wife came out and swore at us too and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady and he swore at us too for $dmitri_prokofitch$
and how was that and i after him i dont remember and i lay right across the way i got hold of $dmitri_prokofitch$ hair and knocked him down and began beating him
and $dmitri_prokofitch$ too caught me by the hair and began beating me but we did it all not for #temper# but in a friendly way for sport
and then $dmitri_prokofitch$ escaped and ran into the #street# and i ran after him but i did not catch him and went back to the flat alone i had to clear up my things
i began putting them together expecting $dmitri_prokofitch$ to come and there in the passage in the #corner# by the #door# i stepped on the box
i saw it lying there wrapped up in paper i took off the paper saw some little hooks undid them and in the box were the ear rings
$mr_raskolnikov$ cried suddenly staring with a blank look of terror at $mr_razumihin$ and he slowly sat up on the sofa leaning on his #hand#
behind the #door# lying behind the #door# behind the #door# yes why what the matter what wrong
$mr_razumihin$ too got up from his seat nothing $mr_raskolnikov$ answered faintly turning to the #wall# all were silent for a while
he must have waked from a dream $mr_razumihin$ said at last looking inquiringly at $zossimov$ the latter slightly shook his #head#
as soon as he saw the ear rings forgetting $dmitri_prokofitch$ and everything he took up his cap and ran to dushkin and as we know got a #rouble# from him
well go on said $zossimov$ what next what next he told a lie saying he found them in the #street# and went off drinking
he keeps repeating his old #story# about the murder i know nothing of it never heard of it till the #day# before yesterday
and why didnt you come to the police till now i was frightened and why did you try to hang yourself
from anxiety what anxiety that i should be accused of it well that the whole #story# and now what do you suppose they deduced from that
why there no supposing there a clue such as it is a fact you wouldnt have your painter set free
now they ve simply taken him for the murderer they havent a shadow of doubt that nonsense you are excited
you must admit that if on the very same #day# and hour ear rings from the old woman box have come into $nikolay$ #hand# they must have come there somehow
but what about the ear rings that a good deal in such a case how did they get there how did they get there
how can you a doctor whose duty it is to study #man# and who has more opportunity than #anyone# else for studying human nature how can you fail to see the character of the #man# in the whole #story#
cried $mr_razumihin$ dont you see at once that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy truth
they came into his #hand# precisely as he has told us he stepped on the box and picked it up the holy truth
the porter and $koch$ and $pestryakov$ and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who was sitting in the porter lodge and the #man# kryukov who had just got out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his arm that is eight or ten witnesses agree that $nikolay$ had $dmitri_prokofitch$ on the ground was lying on him beating him while $dmitri_prokofitch$ hung on to his hair beating him too
but didnt he own himself that he told a lie at first listen to me listen attentively they lay right across the way blocking the thoroughfare
they were sworn at on all sides while they like #child# the very words of the witnesses were falling over one another squealing fighting and laughing with the funniest faces and chasing one another like #child# they ran into the #street#
if they or $nikolay$ alone had murdered them and broken open the boxes or simply taken part in the robbery allow me to ask you one question do their state of mind their squeals and giggles and childish scuffling at the gate #fit# in with axes bloodshed fiendish cunning robbery
they just killed them not five or ten minutes before for the bodies were still warm and at once leaving the flat open knowing that people would go there at once flinging away their booty they rolled about like #child# laughing and attracting general attention
now take careful note the bodies upstairs were warm you understand warm when they found them and there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that
and if the ear rings being found in $nikolay$ #hand# at the very #day# and hour of the murder constitutes an important piece of circumstantial evidence against him although the explanation given by him accounts for it and therefore it does not tell seriously against him one must take into consideration the facts which prove him innocent especially as they are facts that cannot be denied
and do you suppose from the character of our legal system that they will accept or that they are in a position to accept this fact resting simply on a psychological impossibility as irrefutable and conclusively breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution
no they wont accept it they certainly wont because they found the jewel case and the #man# tried to hang himself which he could not have done if he hadnt felt guilty
of course it is strange it impossible indeed but no brother no buts that the #point# that what excites me you must understand
oh i see you are excited wait a bit i forgot to ask you what proof is there that the box came from the old woman
that been proved said $mr_razumihin$ with apparent reluctance frowning $koch$ recognised the jewel case and gave the name of the owner who proved conclusively that it was his
did #anyone# see $nikolay$ at the time that $koch$ and $pestryakov$ were going upstairs at first and is there no evidence about that
even $koch$ and $pestryakov$ did not notice them on their way upstairs though indeed their evidence could not have been worth much
they said they saw the flat was open and that there must be work going on in it but they took no special notice and could not remember whether there actually were #man# at work in it
that bad now another #point# nobody did see him $mr_razumihin$ answered with vexation that the worst of it hm
so the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating one another and laughing that constitutes a strong presumption but
how do you explain the facts yourself how do i explain them what is there to explain it clear at any rate the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear and the jewel case #point# to it
$koch$ like an ass did not stay at the #door# so the murderer popped out and ran down too for he had no other way of escape
he hid from $koch$ $pestryakov$ and the porter in the flat when $nikolay$ and $dmitri_prokofitch$ had just run out of it
he stopped there while the porter and others were going upstairs waited till they were out of hearing and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when $dmitri_prokofitch$ and $nikolay$ ran out into the #street# and there was no one in the entry possibly he was seen but not noticed
the real murderer dropped those ear rings the murderer was upstairs locked in when $koch$ and $pestryakov$ knocked at the #door# there are lots of people going in and out
he must have dropped the ear rings out of his #pocket# when he stood behind the #door# and did not notice he dropped them because he had other things to think of
the jewel case is a conclusive proof that he did stand there that how i explain it too clever no my boy you re too clever
$mr_razumihin$ was exclaiming but at that moment the #door# opened and a personage came in who was a stranger to all present
that beats everything but why why why because everything #fit# too well it too melodramatic a ach chapter this was a gentleman no longer young of a stiff and portly appearance and a cautious and sour countenance
he began by stopping short in the doorway staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to
with the same amazement he stared at $mr_raskolnikov$ who lay undressed dishevelled unwashed on his miserable dirty sofa looking fixedly at him
then with the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth unkempt figure and unshaven face of $mr_razumihin$ who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the face without rising from his seat
mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost affronted he scanned $mr_raskolnikov$ low and narrow cabin a constrained silence lasted for a couple of minutes and then as might be expected some scene shifting took place
reflecting probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs that he would get nothing in this cabin by attempting to overawe them the gentleman softened somewhat and civilly though with some severity emphasising every syllable of his question addressed $zossimov$
$rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ $mr_raskolnikov$ a student or formerly a student $zossimov$ made a slight movement and would have answered had not $mr_razumihin$ anticipated him
here he is lying on the sofa what do you want this familiar what do you want seemed to cut the ground from the feet of the pompous gentleman
he was turning to $mr_razumihin$ but checked himself in time and turned to $zossimov$ again this is $mr_raskolnikov$ mumbled $zossimov$ nodding towards him
then he lazily put his #hand# into his waistcoat #pocket# pulled out a huge gold watch in a round hunter case opened it looked at it and as slowly and lazily proceeded to put it back
then he gave a prolonged yawn opening his mouth as wide as possible $mr_raskolnikov$ himself lay without speaking on his back gazing persistently though without understanding at the stranger
now that his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper it was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish as though he had just undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack
when $zossimov$ said this is $mr_raskolnikov$ he jumped up quickly sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant but weak and breaking voice articulated yes i am $mr_raskolnikov$
but the new comer gradually began to arouse his attention then his wonder then suspicion and even alarm what do you want
the visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ i believe i have reason to #hope# that my name is not wholly unknown to you
but $mr_raskolnikov$ who had expected #something# quite different gazed blankly and dreamily at him making no reply as though he heard the name of $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ for the first time
is it possible that you can up to the present have received no information asked $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ somewhat disconcerted
in reply $mr_raskolnikov$ sank languidly back on the pillow put his #hand# behind his #head# and gazed at the ceiling a look of dismay came into $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ face
$zossimov$ and $mr_razumihin$ stared at him more inquisitively than ever and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment i had presumed and calculated he faltered that a letter posted more than ten #day# if not a fortnight ago
i say why are you standing in the doorway $mr_razumihin$ interrupted suddenly if you ve #something# to say sit down $nastasya$ and you are so crowded
he moved his chair back from the table made a little space between the table and his knees and waited in a rather cramped position for the visitor to thread his way in
the minute was so chosen that it was impossible to refuse and the visitor squeezed his way through hurrying and stumbling
$nastasya$ make room here a chair thread your way in reaching the chair he sat down looking suspiciously at $mr_razumihin$
$rodya$ has been ill for the last five #day# and delirious for three but now he is recovering and has got an appetite
no need to be nervous the latter blurted out this is his doctor who has just had a look at him
i am a comrade of $rodya$ like him formerly a student and now i am nursing him so dont you take any notice of us but go on with your business
thank you but shall i not disturb the invalid by my presence and conversation $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ asked of $zossimov$ no
he has been conscious a long time since the morning went on $mr_razumihin$ whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good nature that $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ began to be more cheerful partly perhaps because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a student
mumbled $zossimov$ you may amuse him he yawned again your mamma began $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ hm $mr_razumihin$ cleared his throat loudly
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ looked at him inquiringly that all right go on $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ shrugged his shoulders your mamma had commenced a letter to you while i was sojourning in her neighbourhood
on my arrival here i purposely allowed a few #day# to elapse before coming to see you in order that i might be fully assured that you were in full possession of the tidings but now to my astonishment
i know i know $mr_raskolnikov$ cried suddenly with impatient vexation so you are the fiancé i know and that enough
there was no doubt about $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ being offended this time but he said nothing he made a violent effort to understand what it all meant
meanwhile $mr_raskolnikov$ who had turned a little towards him when he answered began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity as though he had not had a good look at him yet or as though #something# new had struck him he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at him
there certainly was #something# peculiar in $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ whole appearance #something# which seemed to justify the title of fiancé so unceremoniously applied to him
in the first place it was evident far too much so indeed that $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ had made eager use of his few #day# in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation of his betrothed a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding indeed
even his own perhaps too complacent consciousness of the agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such circumstances seeing that $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ had taken up the rôle of fiancé
all his clothes were fresh from the tailor and were all right except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate
there was a moment silence even the stylish new round hat had the same significance $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his #hand#
the exquisite pair of lavender gloves real louvain told the same tale if only from the fact of his not wearing them but carrying them in his #hand# for show
he wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade light thin trousers a waistcoat of the same new and fine linen a cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it and the best of it was this all suited $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
light and youthful colours predominated in $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ attire his very fresh and even handsome face looked younger than his forty five years at all times
even his hair touched here and there with grey though it had been combed and curled at a hairdresser did not give him a stupid appearance as curled hair usually does by inevitably suggesting a german on his wedding #day#
if there really was #something# unpleasing and repulsive in his rather good looking and imposing countenance it was due to quite other causes
his dark mutton chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides growing thickly upon his shining clean shaven chin after scanning mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ unceremoniously $mr_raskolnikov$ smiled malignantly sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as before
but mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no notice of their oddities i feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation he began again breaking the silence with an effort
i have too a very important legal affair in the senate not to mention other preoccupations which you may well conjecture
if i had been aware of your illness i should have come earlier but you know what business is i am expecting your mamma and sister any minute
$mr_raskolnikov$ made a movement and seemed about to speak his face showed some excitement $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ paused waited but as nothing followed he went on
any minute i have found a lodging for them on their arrival where asked $mr_raskolnikov$ weakly very near here in bakaleyev house
that in voskresensky put in $mr_razumihin$ there are two storeys of rooms let by a merchant called yushin i ve been there
yes rooms a disgusting place filthy stinking and what more of doubtful character things have happened there and there are all sorts of queer people living there
i could not of course find out so much about it for i am a stranger in petersburg myself $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ replied huffily
and i went there about a scandalous business it cheap though however the two rooms are exceedingly clean and as it is for so short a time
i have already taken a permanent that is our future flat he said addressing $mr_raskolnikov$ and i am having it done up
and meanwhile i am myself cramped for room in a lodging with my #friend# $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ in the flat of madame lippevechsel it was he who told me of bakaleyev house too
$andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ said $mr_raskolnikov$ slowly as if recalling #something# yes $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ a clerk in the ministry do you know him
yes no $mr_raskolnikov$ answered excuse me i fancied so from your inquiry i was once his guardian a very nice young #man# and advanced
i like to meet young people one learns new things from them $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ looked round hopefully at them all
how do you mean asked $mr_razumihin$ in the most serious and essential matters $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ replied as though delighted at the question
all the novelties reforms ideas have reached us in the provinces but to see it all more clearly one must be in petersburg
you see it ten years since i visited petersburg and it my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the younger generation
and i confess i am delighted at what your question is a wide one i may be mistaken but i fancy i find clearer views more so to say criticism more practicality
that true $zossimov$ let drop nonsense there no practicality $mr_razumihin$ flew at him practicality is a difficult thing to find it does not drop down from heaven
ideas if you like are fermenting he said to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and #desire# for good exists though it in a childish form and honesty you may find although there are crowds of brigands
and for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from all practical life anyway there no practicality practicality goes well shod
of course people do get carried away and make mistakes but one must have indulgence those mistakes are merely evidence of enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment
i dont agree with you $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ replied with evident enjoyment if little has been done the time has been but short of means i will not speak
it my personal view if you care to know that #something# has been accomplished already new valuable ideas new valuable works are circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors
in a word we have cut ourselves off irrevocably from the past and that to my thinking is a great thing
literature is taking a maturer form many injurious prejudices have been rooted up and turned into ridicule he learnt it by heart to show off
$mr_raskolnikov$ pronounced suddenly what asked $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ not catching his words but he received no reply that all true $zossimov$ hastened to interpose
you must admit he went on addressing $mr_razumihin$ with a shade of triumph and superciliousness he almost added young #man# that there is an advance or as they say now progress in the name of science and economic truth
isnt it so $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ went on glancing affably at $zossimov$ a commonplace no not a commonplace hitherto for instance if i were told love thy neighbour what came of it
it came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both were left half naked
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ went on perhaps with excessive haste as a russian proverb has it catch several hares and you wont catch one
science now tells us love yourself before all #man# for everything in the world rests on self interest you love yourself and manage your own affairs properly and your coat remains whole
economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in society the more whole coats so to say the firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare organised too
therefore in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself i am acquiring so to speak for all and helping to bring to pass my neighbour getting a little more than a torn coat and that not from private personal liberality but as a consequence of the general advance
the idea is simple but unhappily it has been a long time reaching us being hindered by idealism and sentimentality and yet it would seem to want very little wit to perceive it
i began this discussion with an object but i ve grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse oneself of this incessant flow of commonplaces always the same that by jove i blush even when other people talk like that
excuse me i ve very little wit myself $mr_razumihin$ cut in sharply and so let us drop it you are in a hurry no doubt to exhibit your acquirements and i dont blame you
i only wanted to find out what sort of #man# you are for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything they touched that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire
that quite pardonable that enough excuse me sir said $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ affronted and speaking with excessive dignity do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that
i too oh my dear sir how could i come that enough $mr_razumihin$ concluded and he turned abruptly to $zossimov$ to continue their previous conversation
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ had the good sense to accept the disavowal he made up his mind to take leave in another minute or two
i trust our acquaintance he said addressing $mr_raskolnikov$ may upon your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware become closer
above all i #hope# for your return to health $mr_raskolnikov$ did not even turn his #head# $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ began getting up from his chair
one of her customers must have killed her $zossimov$ declared positively not a doubt of it replied $mr_razumihin$
$porfiry_petrovitch$ doesnt give his opinion but is examining all who have left pledges with her there examining them $mr_raskolnikov$ asked aloud
$koch$ has given the names of some of them other names are on the wrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves
yes what then nothing how does he get hold of them asked $zossimov$ it must have been a cunning and practised ruffian
the boldness of it the coolness that just what it wasnt interposed $mr_razumihin$ that what throws you all off the scent
but i maintain that he is not cunning not practised and probably this was his first crime the supposition that it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesnt work
suppose him to have been inexperienced and it clear that it was only a chance that saved him and chance may do anything
he took jewels worth ten or twenty #rouble# stuffing his #pocket# with them ransacked the old woman trunks her rags and they found fifteen hundred #rouble# besides notes in a box in the top drawer of the chest
why he did not foresee obstacles perhaps and how did he set to work he did not know how to rob he could only murder
it was his first crime i assure you his first crime he lost his #head# and he got off more by luck than good counsel
he was standing hat and gloves in #hand# but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrases
you are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker i believe $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ put in addressing $zossimov$ he was evidently anxious to make a favourable impression and his vanity overcame his prudence
yes you ve heard of it oh yes being in the neighbourhood do you know the details i cant say that but another circumstance interests me in the case the whole question so to say
not to speak of the fact that crime has been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last five years not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes too crime is increasing proportionately
in one place one hears of a student robbing the mail on the high road in another place people of good social position forge false banknotes in moscow of late a whole gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets and one of the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history then our secretary abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain
and if this old woman the pawnbroker has been murdered by someone of a higher class in society for peasants dont pawn gold trinkets how are we to explain this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society
there are many economic changes put in $zossimov$ how are we to explain it $mr_razumihin$ caught him up
it might be explained by our inveterate impracticality how do you mean what answer had your lecturer in moscow to make to the question why he was forging notes
everybody is getting rich one way or another so i want to make haste to get rich too i dont remember the exact words but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing without waiting or working
we ve grown used to having everything ready made to walking on crutches to having our food chewed for us then the great hour struck and every #man# showed himself in his true colours
the emancipation of the serfs in is meant translator note but morality and so to speak principles
but why do you worry about it $mr_raskolnikov$ interposed suddenly it in accordance with your theory in accordance with my theory
why carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now and it follows that people may be killed upon my word cried $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
no that not so put in $zossimov$ $mr_raskolnikov$ lay with a white face and twitching upper lip breathing painfully
there a measure in all things $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ went on superciliously economic ideas are not an incitement to murder and one has but to suppose
and is it true $mr_raskolnikov$ interposed once more suddenly again in a voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him is it true that you told your fiancée within an hour of her acceptance that what pleased you most was that she was a beggar because it was better to raise a wife from #poverty# so that you may have complete control over her and reproach her with your being her benefactor
excuse me allow me to assure you that the report which has reached you or rather let me say has been conveyed to you has no foundation in truth and i suspect who in a word this arrow in a word your mamma she seemed to me in other things with all her excellent qualities of a somewhat high flown and romantic way of thinking
upon my word $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ cried wrathfully and irritably crimson with #confusion# to distort my words in this way but i was a thousand miles from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in so fanciful a way
i tell you what cried $mr_raskolnikov$ raising himself on his pillow and fixing his piercing glittering eyes upon him i tell you what
and indeed indeed what $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ stood still waiting with a defiant and offended face silence lasted for some seconds
why if ever again you dare to mention a single word about my #mother# i shall send you flying downstairs
what the matter with you cried $mr_razumihin$ so that how it is $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ turned pale and bit his lip
let me tell you sir he began deliberately doing his utmost to restrain himself but breathing hard at the first moment i saw you you were ill disposed to me but i remained here on purpose to find out more
i could forgive a great deal in a sick #man# and a connection but you never after this i am not ill cried $mr_raskolnikov$
but $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ was already leaving without finishing his speech squeezing between the table and the chair $mr_razumihin$ got up this time to let him pass
without glancing at #anyone# and not even nodding to $zossimov$ who had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick #man# alone he went out lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid crushing it as he stooped to go out of the #door#
so much the worse go to hell and even the curve of his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received
how could you how could you $mr_razumihin$ said shaking his #head# in perplexity let me alone let me alone all of you
$mr_raskolnikov$ cried in a frenzy will you ever leave off tormenting me i am not afraid of you i am not afraid of #anyone# anyone now
get away from me i want to be alone alone alone come along said $zossimov$ nodding to $mr_razumihin$ but we cant leave him like this
come along $zossimov$ repeated insistently and he went out $mr_razumihin$ #thought# a minute and ran to overtake him it might be worse not to obey him said $zossimov$ on the stairs
he mustnt be irritated what the matter with him if only he could get some favourable shock that what would do it
at first he was better you know he has got #something# on his mind some fixed idea weighing on him i am very much afraid so he must have
from his conversation i gather he is going to marry his sister and that he had received a letter about it just before his illness
but have you noticed he takes no interest in anything he does not respond to anything except one #point# on which he seems excited that the murder
perhaps it that gentleman $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ yes confound the #man# he may have upset the case altogether yes yes $mr_razumihin$ agreed i noticed that too
he is interested frightened it gave him a shock on the #day# he was ill in the police office he fainted
tell me more about that this #evening# and i ll tell you #something# afterwards he interests me very much in half an hour i ll go and see him again
there ll be no inflammation though thanks and i ll wait with pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him through $nastasya$ $mr_raskolnikov$ left alone looked with impatience and #misery# at $nastasya$ but she still lingered
wont you have some tea now she asked later i am sleepy leave me he turned abruptly to the #wall# $nastasya$ went out
but as soon as she went out he got up latched the #door# undid the parcel which $mr_razumihin$ had brought in that #evening# and had tied up again and began dressing
strange to say he seemed immediately to have become perfectly calm not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic fear that had haunted him of late
chapter vi it was the first moment of a strange sudden calm his movements were precise and definite a firm purpose was evident in them
to #day# to #day# he muttered to himself he understood that he was still weak but his intense spiritual concentration gave him strength and self confidence
when he had dressed in entirely new clothes he looked at the money lying on the table and after a moment #thought# put it in his #pocket#
he hoped moreover that he would not fall down in the #street# it was twenty five #rouble# he took also all the copper change from the ten #rouble# spent by $mr_razumihin$ on the clothes
then he softly unlatched the #door# went out slipped downstairs and glanced in at the open kitchen #door# $nastasya$ was standing with her back to him blowing up the landlady samovar
she heard nothing who would have dreamed of his going out indeed a minute later he was in the #street# it was nearly eight clock the sun was setting
his #head# felt rather dizzy a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his feverish eyes and his wasted pale and yellow face
he did not know and did not think where he was going he had one #thought# only that all this must be ended to #day# once for all immediately that he would not return home without it because he would not go on living like that
it was as stifling as before but he eagerly drank in the stinking dusty town air how with what to make an #end#
he had not an idea about it he did not even want to think of it he drove away #thought# thought tortured him
all he knew all he felt was that everything must be changed one way or another he repeated with desperate and immovable self confidence and determination
a dark haired young #man# with a barrel organ was standing in the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very sentimental song
from old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the hay market he was accompanying a girl of fifteen who stood on the pavement in front of him
she was dressed up in a crinoline a mantle and a straw hat with a flame coloured feather in it all very old and shabby
in a strong and rather agreeable voice cracked and coarsened by #street# singing she sang in #hope# of getting a copper from the shop
she broke off abruptly on a sentimental high note shouted sharply to the organ grinder come on and both moved on to the next shop
$mr_raskolnikov$ joined two or three listeners took out a five copeck piece and put it in the girl #hand# do you like #street# music
i love to hear singing to a #street# organ said $mr_raskolnikov$ and his manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject i like it on cold dark damp autumn #evening# they must be damp when all the passers by have pale green sickly faces or better still when wet snow is falling straight down when there no wind you know what i mean and the #street# lamps shine through it
said $mr_raskolnikov$ addressing a middle aged #man# standing idly by him the #man# looked at him startled and wondering i dont know
muttered the stranger frightened by the question and $mr_raskolnikov$ strange manner and he crossed over to the other side of the #street#
$mr_raskolnikov$ walked straight on and came out at the #corner# of the hay market where the huckster and his wife had talked with $lizaveta_ivanovna$ but they were not there now
recognising the place he stopped looked round and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a corn chandler shop
excuse me isnt there a #man# who keeps a booth with his wife at this #corner# all sorts of people keep booths here answered the young #man# glancing superciliously at $mr_raskolnikov$
what his name what he was christened arent you a zaraïsky #man# too which province the young #man# looked at $mr_raskolnikov$ again
it not a province your excellency but a district graciously forgive me your excellency is that a tavern at the top there
yes it an eating house and there a billiard room and you ll find princesses there too la la $mr_raskolnikov$ crossed the square in that #corner# there was a dense crowd of peasants
he pushed his way into the thickest part of it looking at the faces he felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into conversation with people
but the peasants took no notice of him they were all shouting in groups together he stood and #thought# a little and took a turning to the right in the direction of
of late he had often felt drawn to wander about this district when he felt depressed that he might feel more so
he had often crossed that little #street# which turns at an angle leading from the market place to sadovy #street# now he walked along thinking of nothing
at that #point# there is a great block of buildings entirely let out in dram shops and eating houses women were continually running in and out bare headed and in their indoor clothes
here and there they gathered in groups on the pavement especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in the lower storeys
from one of these a loud din sounds of singing the tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment floated into the #street#
a crowd of women were thronging round the #door# some were sitting on the #step# others on the pavement others were standing talking
a drunken soldier smoking a cigarette was walking near them in the road swearing he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere but had forgotten where
one beggar was quarrelling with another and a #man# dead drunk was lying right across the road $mr_raskolnikov$ joined the throng of women who were talking in husky voices
they were bare headed and wore cotton dresses and goatskin shoes there were women of forty and some not more than seventeen almost all had blackened eyes
he felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and uproar in the saloon below someone could be heard within dancing frantically marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air
he listened intently gloomily and dreamily bending down at the entrance and peeping inquisitively in from the pavement oh my handsome soldier dont beat me for nothing trilled the thin voice of the singer
$mr_raskolnikov$ felt a great #desire# to make out what he was singing as though everything depended on that shall i go in
he #thought# they are laughing from drink shall i get drunk wont you come in one of the women asked him
her voice was still musical and less thick than the others she was young and not repulsive the only one of the group
why she pretty he said drawing himself up and looking at her she smiled much pleased at the compliment
you re very nice looking yourself she said isnt he thin though observed another woman in a deep bass have you just come out of a hospital
they re all generals daughters it seems but they have all snub noses interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face wearing a loose coat
see how jolly they are go along with you i ll go sweetie and he darted down into the saloon below
$mr_raskolnikov$ moved on i say sir the girl shouted after him what is it she hesitated i ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you #kind# gentleman but now i feel shy
give me six copecks for a drink there a nice young #man# $mr_raskolnikov$ gave her what came first fifteen copecks ah what a good natured gentleman
what your name ask for duclida well that too much one of the women observed shaking her #head# at duclida
i dont know how you can ask like that i believe i should drop with shame $mr_raskolnikov$ looked curiously at the speaker
she was a pock marked wench of thirty covered with bruises with her upper lip swollen she made her criticism quietly and earnestly
i ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks an hour before his death that if he had to live on some high rock on such a narrow ledge that he only room to stand and the ocean everlasting darkness everlasting solitude everlasting tempest around him if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his life a thousand years eternity it were better to live so than to die at once
where is it #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$ where is it only to live to live and live life whatever it may be
how true it is good god how true #man# is a vile creature and vile is he who calls him vile for that he added a moment later
he went into another #street# bah the palais de cristal $mr_razumihin$ was just talking of the palais de cristal but what on earth was it
i wanted yes the newspapers $zossimov$ said he read it in the papers have you the papers he asked going into a very spacious and positively clean restaurant consisting of several rooms which were however rather empty
two or three people were drinking tea and in a room further away were sitting four #man# drinking champagne $mr_raskolnikov$ fancied that $mr_zametov$ was one of them but he could not be sure at that distance
give me some tea and bring me the papers the old ones for the last five #day# and i ll give you #something#
what if it is he #thought# will you have vodka asked the waiter yes sir here to #day#
no vodka the old newspapers and the tea were brought $mr_raskolnikov$ sat down and began to look through them
an accident on a #staircase# spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol a fire in peski a fire in the petersburg quarter another fire in the petersburg quarter and another fire in the petersburg quarter
oh damn these are the items of intelligence ah here it is he found at last what he was seeking and began to read it
the lines danced before his eyes but he read it all and began eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers
he looked up it was the #head# clerk $mr_zametov$ looking just the same with the rings on his fingers and the watch chain with the curly black hair parted and pomaded with the smart waistcoat rather shabby coat and doubtful linen
his #hand# shook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets suddenly someone sat down beside him at his table he was in a good humour at least he was smiling very gaily and good humouredly
his dark face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk what you here he began in surprise speaking as though he known him all his life
why $mr_razumihin$ told me only yesterday you were unconscious how strange and do you know i ve been to see you
$mr_raskolnikov$ knew he would come up to him he laid aside the papers and turned to $mr_zametov$ there was a smile on his lips and a new shade of irritable impatience was apparent in that smile
i know you have he answered i ve heard it you looked for my sock and you know $mr_razumihin$ has lost his heart to you
he says you ve been with him to luise $katerina_ivanovna$ you know the woman you tried to befriend for whom you winked to the explosive lieutenant and he would not understand
do you remember how could he fail to understand it was quite clear wasnt it what a hot #head# he is
the explosive one no your #friend# $mr_razumihin$ you must have a jolly life $mr_zametov$ entrance free to the most agreeable places
who been pouring champagne into you just now we ve just been having a drink together you talk about pouring it into me
by way of a fee you profit by everything $mr_raskolnikov$ laughed it all right my dear boy he added slapping $mr_zametov$ on the shoulder
i am not speaking from #temper# but in a friendly way for sport as that workman of yours said when he was scuffling with $dmitri_prokofitch$ in the case of the old woman
how do you know about it perhaps i know more about it than you do how strange you are
i am sure you are still very unwell you oughtnt to have come out oh do i seem strange to you
yes what are you doing reading the papers yes there a lot about the fires no i am not reading about the fires
here he looked mysteriously at $mr_zametov$ his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile no i am not reading about the fires he went on winking at $mr_zametov$
but confess now my dear fellow you re awfully anxious to know what i am reading about i am not in the least
maynt i ask a question why do you keep on listen you are a #man# of culture and education i was in the sixth class at the gymnasium said $mr_zametov$ with some dignity
sixth class ah my cock sparrow with your parting and your rings you are a gentleman of fortune foo what a charming boy
here $mr_raskolnikov$ broke into a nervous laugh right in $mr_zametov$ face the latter drew back more amazed than offended
foo how strange you are $mr_zametov$ repeated very seriously i cant help thinking you are still delirious i am delirious
you are fibbing my cock sparrow so i am strange you find me curious do you yes curious shall i tell you what i was reading about what i was looking for
see what a lot of papers i ve made them bring me suspicious eh well what is it you prick up your ears
how do you mean prick up my ears i ll explain that afterwards but now my boy i declare to you no better i confess
no that not right either i make a deposition and you take it i depose that i was reading that i was looking and searching
i was searching and came here on purpose to do it for news of the murder of the old pawnbroker woman he articulated at last almost in a whisper bringing his face exceedingly close to the face of $mr_zametov$
he screwed up his eyes and paused $mr_zametov$ looked at him steadily without moving or drawing his face away
what struck $mr_zametov$ afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for exactly a minute and that they gazed at one another all the while
what if you have been reading about it he cried at last perplexed and impatient that no business of mine
the same old woman $mr_raskolnikov$ went on in the same whisper not heeding $mr_zametov$ explanation about whom you were talking in the police office you remember when i fainted
what of it well do you understand now what do you mean understand what $mr_zametov$ brought out almost alarmed
$mr_raskolnikov$ set and earnest face was suddenly transformed and he suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before as though utterly unable to restrain himself
and in one flash he recalled with extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past that moment when he stood with the axe behind the #door# while the latch trembled and the #man# outside swore and shook it and he had a sudden #desire# to shout at them to swear at them to put out his tongue at them to mock them to laugh and laugh and laugh
you are either mad or began $mr_zametov$ and he broke off as though stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind
or or what what come tell me nothing said $mr_zametov$ getting angry it all nonsense both were silent
after his sudden #fit# of laughter $mr_raskolnikov$ became suddenly thoughtful and melancholy he put his elbow on the table and leaned his #head# on his #hand#
he seemed to have completely forgotten $mr_zametov$ the silence lasted for some time why dont you drink your tea it getting cold said $mr_zametov$
$mr_raskolnikov$ sipped the glass put a morsel of bread in his mouth and suddenly looking at $mr_zametov$ seemed to remember everything and pulled himself together
what tea oh yes at the same moment his face resumed its original mocking expression he went on drinking tea
only the other #day# i read in the moscow news that a whole gang of false coiners had been caught in moscow
there have been a great many of these crimes lately said $mr_zametov$ it was a regular society they used to forge tickets
oh but it was a long time ago i read about it a month ago $mr_raskolnikov$ answered calmly so you consider them criminals
he added smiling of course they are criminals they they are #child# simpletons not criminals why half a hundred people meeting for such an object what an idea
three would be too many and then they want to have more faith in one another than in themselves one has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses
well let us suppose that these simpletons succeed and each makes a million and what follows for the rest of their lives
simpletons they engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes what a thing to trust to a casual stranger each is dependent on the others for the rest of his life
and they did not know how to change the notes either the #man# who changed the notes took five thousand #rouble# and his #hand# trembled
he counted the first four thousand but did not count the fifth thousand he was in such a hurry to get the money into his #pocket# and run away
better hang oneself at once of course he roused suspicion and the whole thing came to a crash through one fool
is it possible that his #hand# trembled observed $mr_zametov$ yes that quite possible that i feel quite sure is possible
sometimes one cant stand things cant stand that why could you stand it then no i couldnt for the sake of a hundred #rouble# to face such a terrible #experience#
to go with false notes into a bank where it their business to spot that sort of thing no i should not have the face to do it
would you $mr_raskolnikov$ had an intense #desire# again to put his tongue out shivers kept running down his spine
this is how i would change the notes i count the first thousand three or four times backwards and forwards looking at every note
i count that half way through and then hold some fifty #rouble# note to the light then turn it then hold it to the light again to see whether it was a good one
i am afraid i would say a relation of mine lost twenty five #rouble# the other #day# through a false note and then i tell them the whole #story#
and after i began counting the third no excuse me i would say i fancy i made a mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand i am not sure
i should do it quite differently $mr_raskolnikov$ began and then i set to the second thousand and so i would give up the third thousand and go back to the second
and when i had finished i pick out one from the fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light and ask again change them please and put the clerk into such a stew that he would not know how to get rid of me
and so on to the #end# when i finished and had gone out i come back no excuse me and ask for some explanation
that how i do it foo what terrible things you say said $mr_zametov$ laughing but all that is only talk
i dare say when it came to deeds you make a slip i believe that even a practised desperate #man# cannot always reckon on himself much less you and i
the murderer seems to have been a desperate fellow he risked everything in open daylight was saved by a miracle but his #hand# shook too
to take an example near home that old woman murdered in our district he did not succeed in robbing the place he couldnt stand it
that was clear from the $mr_raskolnikov$ seemed offended clear why dont you catch him then he cried maliciously gibing at $mr_zametov$
well they will catch him who you do you suppose you could catch him you ve a tough job a great #point# for you is whether a #man# is spending money or not
if he had no money and suddenly begins spending he must be the #man# so that any #child# can mislead you
a #man# will commit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes drinking in a tavern
the fact is they always do that though answered $mr_zametov$ they are caught spending money they are not all as cunning as you are
you wouldnt go to a tavern of course $mr_raskolnikov$ frowned and looked steadily at $mr_zametov$ you seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how i should behave in that case too
he asked with displeasure i should like to $mr_zametov$ answered firmly and seriously somewhat too much earnestness began to appear in his words and looks
this is how i should behave $mr_raskolnikov$ began again bringing his face close to $mr_zametov$ again staring at him and speaking in a whisper so that the latter positively shuddered
i should have taken the money and jewels i should have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place with fences round it and scarcely #anyone# to be seen some kitchen garden or place of that sort
i should have looked out beforehand some stone weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the #corner# from the time the house was built
i would lift that stone there would sure to be a hollow under it and i would put the jewels and money in that hole
then i roll the stone back so that it would look as before would press it down with my foot and walk away
very much very much all right then this is what i should have done and for a year or two three maybe i would not touch it
you are a madman said $mr_zametov$ and for some reason he too spoke in a whisper and moved away from $mr_raskolnikov$ whose eyes were glittering
and well they could search there be no trace he had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering
he bent down as close as possible to $mr_zametov$ and his lips began to move without uttering a word this lasted for half a minute he knew what he was doing but could not restrain himself
the terrible word trembled on his lips like the latch on that #door# in another moment it will break out in another moment he will let it go he will speak out
and what if it was i who murdered the old woman and $lizaveta_ivanovna$ he said suddenly and realised what he had done
$mr_zametov$ looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth his face wore a contorted smile but is it possible he brought out faintly
$mr_raskolnikov$ looked wrathfully at him own up that you believed it yes you did not a bit of it i believe it less than ever now $mr_zametov$ cried hastily
i ve caught my cock sparrow so you did believe it before if now you believe less than ever not at all cried $mr_zametov$ obviously embarrassed
have you been frightening me so as to lead up to this you dont believe it then what were you talking about behind my back when i went out of the police office
and why did the explosive lieutenant question me after i fainted hey there he shouted to the waiter getting up and taking his cap how much
thirty copecks the latter replied running up and there is twenty copecks for vodka see what a lot of money
he held out his shaking #hand# to $mr_zametov$ with notes in it red notes and blue twenty five #rouble# where did i get them
and where did my new clothes come from you know i had not a copeck you ve cross examined my landlady i ll be bound
he went out trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical sensation in which there was an element of insufferable rapture
well that enough assez causé till we meet again yet he was gloomy and terribly tired his face was twisted as after a #fit#
any shock any irritating sensation stimulated and revived his energies at once but his strength failed as quickly when the stimulus was removed
$mr_raskolnikov$ had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on a certain #point# and had made up his mind for him conclusively
his fatigue increased rapidly $mr_zametov$ left alone sat for a long time in the same place plunged in #thought# $ilya_petrovitch$ is a blockhead he decided
$mr_raskolnikov$ had hardly opened the #door# of the restaurant when he stumbled against $mr_razumihin$ on the #step# they did not see each other till they almost knocked against each other
for a moment they stood looking each other up and down $mr_razumihin$ was greatly astounded then anger real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes
so here you are he shouted at the top of his voice you ran away from your bed and here i ve been looking for you under the sofa
we went up to the #garret# i almost beat $nastasya$ on your account and here he is after all $rodya$ what is the meaning of it
tell me the whole truth confess do you hear it means that i sick to death of you all and i want to be alone $mr_raskolnikov$ answered calmly
when you are not able to walk when your face is as white as a sheet and you are gasping for breath
alone idiot what have you been doing in the palais de cristal own up at once let me go said $mr_raskolnikov$ and tried to pass him
this was too much for $mr_razumihin$ he gripped him firmly by the shoulder let you go you dare tell me to let you go
do you know what i ll do with you directly i ll pick you up tie you up in a bundle carry you home under my arm and lock you up
a strange #desire# you have to shower benefits on a #man# who curses them who feels them a burden in fact
listen $mr_razumihin$ $mr_raskolnikov$ began quietly apparently calm cant you see that i dont want your benevolence why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness
maybe i was very glad to die didnt i tell you plainly enough to #day# that you were torturing me that i was sick of you
you seem to want to torture people i assure you that all that is seriously hindering my recovery because it continually irritating me
you saw $zossimov$ went away just now to avoid irritating me you leave me alone too for goodness sake what right have you indeed to keep me by force
dont you see that i am in possession of all my faculties now how how can i persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness
i may be ungrateful i may be mean only let me be for god sake let me be let me be let me be
he began calmly gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was about to utter but finished panting for breath in a frenzy as he had been with $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
$mr_razumihin$ stood a moment #thought# and let his #hand# drop well go to hell then he said gently and thoughtfully
stay he roared as $mr_raskolnikov$ was about to move listen to me let me tell you that you are all a set of babbling posing idiots
if you ve any little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg and you are plagiarists even in that
there isnt a sign of independent life in you you are made of spermaceti ointment and you ve lymph in your veins instead of blood
i dont believe in #anyone# of you in any circumstances the first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being
stop he cried with redoubled fury noticing that $mr_raskolnikov$ was again making a movement hear me out you know i having a house warming this #evening#
and if you werent a fool a common fool a perfect fool if you were an original instead of a translation you see $rodya$ i recognise you re a clever fellow but you re a fool and if you werent a fool you come round to me this #evening# instead of wearing out your boots in the #street#
i dare say they ve arrived by now but i left my uncle there i just ran in to receive the guests since you have gone out there no help for it
i give you a snug easy chair my landlady has one a cup of tea company or you could lie on the sofa any way you would be with us
$zossimov$ will be there too will you come no rubbish $mr_razumihin$ shouted out of patience how do you know
you cant answer for yourself you dont know anything about it thousands of times i ve fought tooth and nail with people and run back to them afterwards
one feels ashamed and goes back to a #man# so remember potchinkov house on the third storey why $mr_razumihin$ i do believe you let anybody beat you from sheer benevolence
beat whom me i twist his nose off at the mere idea potchinkov house babushkin flat i shall not come $mr_razumihin$
$mr_raskolnikov$ turned and walked away i bet you will $mr_razumihin$ shouted after him i refuse to know you if you dont
stay hey is $mr_zametov$ in there yes did you see him yes talked to him yes what about confound you dont tell me then
potchinkov house babushkin flat remember $mr_raskolnikov$ walked on and turned the #corner# into sadovy #street# $mr_razumihin$ looked after him thoughtfully
then with a wave of his #hand# he went into the house but stopped short of the stairs confound it he went on almost aloud
he talked sensibly but yet i am a fool as if madmen didnt talk sensibly and this was just what $zossimov$ seemed afraid of
he struck his finger on his forehead what if how could i let him go off alone he may drown himself
ach what a blunder i cant and he ran back to overtake $mr_raskolnikov$ but there was no trace of him
$mr_raskolnikov$ walked straight to bridge stood in the middle and leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance
with a curse he returned with rapid #step# to the palais de cristal to question $mr_zametov$ on parting with $mr_razumihin$ he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this place
bending over the water he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the sunset at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight at one distant attic window on the left bank flashing as though on fire in the last rays of the setting sun at the darkening water of the canal and the water seemed to catch his attention
at last red circles flashed before his eyes the houses seemed moving the passers by the canal banks the carriages all danced before his eyes
he longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the #street# suddenly he started saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight
he became aware of someone standing on the right side of him he looked and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her #head# with a long yellow wasted face and red sunken eyes
suddenly she leaned her right #hand# on the parapet lifted her right leg over the railing then her left and threw herself into the canal
the filthy water parted and swallowed up its victim for a moment but an instant later the drowning woman floated to the surface moving slowly with the current her #head# and legs in the water her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back
a woman drowning shouted dozens of voices people ran up both banks were thronged with spectators on the bridge people crowded about $mr_raskolnikov$ pressing up behind him
she was looking straight at him but obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one a woman drowning mercy on it
it our afrosinya a woman cried tearfully close by mercy save her #kind# people pull her out a boat a boat was shouted in the crowd
but there was no need of a boat a policeman ran down the #step# to the canal threw off his great coat and his boots and rushed into the water
it was easy to reach her she floated within a couple of yards from the #step# he caught hold of her clothes with his right #hand# and with his left seized a pole which a comrade held out to him the drowning woman was pulled out at once
she soon recovered consciousness raised her #head# sat up and began sneezing and coughing stupidly wiping her wet dress with her #hand#
they laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment she said nothing she drunk herself out of her senses the same woman voice wailed at her side
i ran out to the shop just now left my little girl to look after her and here she in trouble again
out of her senses the other #day# she tried to hang herself we cut her down a neighbour gentleman a neighbour we live close by the second house from the #end# see yonder
the crowd broke up the police still remained round the woman someone mentioned the police station $mr_raskolnikov$ looked on with a strange sensation of indifference and apathy
he felt disgusted no that loathsome water it not good enough he muttered to himself nothing will come of it he added no use to wait
what about the police office and why isnt $mr_zametov$ at the police office the police office is open till ten clock
he turned his back to the railing and looked about him very well then he said resolutely he moved from the bridge and walked in the direction of the police office
even his depression had passed there was not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out to make an #end# of it all
his heart felt hollow and empty he did not want to think complete apathy had succeeded to it well it a way out of it he #thought# walking slowly and listlessly along the canal bank
anyway i ll make an #end# for i want to but is it a way out what does it matter there ll be the square yard of space ha
but what an #end# is it really the #end# shall i tell them or not ah damn how tired i am
if i could find somewhere to sit or lie down soon what i am most ashamed of is its being so stupid
but i dont care about that either what idiotic ideas come into one #head# to reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the second turning to the left
but at the first turning he stopped and after a minute #thought# turned into a side #street# and went two #street# out of his way possibly without any object or possibly to delay a minute and gain time
he walked looking at the ground suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear he lifted his #head# and saw that he was standing at the very gate of the house
it was only a few paces away he had not passed it he had not been near it since that #evening#
he went into the house passed through the gateway then into the first entrance on the right and began mounting the familiar #staircase# to the fourth storey
he stopped at each landing and looked round him with curiosity on the first landing the framework of the window had been taken out
an overwhelming unaccountable prompting drew him on the narrow steep #staircase# was very dark that wasnt so then he #thought#
here was the flat on the second storey where $nikolay$ and $dmitri_prokofitch$ had been working it shut up and the #door# newly painted
so it to let then the third storey and the fourth here he was perplexed to find the #door# of the flat wide open
there were #man# there he could hear voices he had not expected that after brief #hesitation# he mounted the last stairs and went into the flat
this seemed to amaze him he somehow fancied that he would find everything as he left it even perhaps the corpses in the same places on the floor
it too was being done up there were workmen in it and now bare #wall# no furniture it seemed strange he walked to the window and sat down on the window sill
they were papering the #wall# with a new white paper covered with lilac flowers instead of the old dirty yellow one
there were two workmen both young fellows but one much younger than the other $mr_raskolnikov$ for some reason felt horribly annoyed by this
the workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home
he looked at the new paper with dislike as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed they took no notice of $mr_raskolnikov$ coming in they were talking
$mr_raskolnikov$ folded his arms and listened she comes to me in the morning said the elder to the younger very early all dressed up
why are you preening and prinking says i i am ready to do anything to please you tit vassilitch that a way of going on
and she dressed up like a regular fashion book and what is a fashion book the younger one asked
a fashion book is a lot of pictures coloured and they come to the tailors here every saturday by post from abroad to show folks how to dress the male sex as well as the female
he obviously regarded the other as an authority they re pictures the gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies fluffles they re beyond anything you can fancy
there nothing you cant find in petersburg the younger cried enthusiastically except father and #mother# there everything except them there everything to be found my boy the elder declared sententiously
$mr_raskolnikov$ got up and walked into the other room where the strong box the bed and the chest of drawers had been the room seemed to him very tiny without furniture in it
the paper was the same the paper in the #corner# showed where the case of ikons had stood he looked at it and went to the window
the elder workman looked at him askance what do you want he asked suddenly instead of answering $mr_raskolnikov$ went into the passage and pulled the bell
the same bell the same cracked note he rang it a second and a third time he listened and remembered the hideous and agonisingly fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more vividly
he shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more satisfaction well what do you want who are you
the workman shouted going out to him $mr_raskolnikov$ went inside again i want to take a flat he said
i am looking round it not the time to look at rooms at night and you ought to come up with the porter
the floors have been washed will they be painted $mr_raskolnikov$ went on is there no blood what blood
why the old woman and her sister were murdered here there was a perfect pool there but who are you
the workman cried uneasy who am i yes you want to know come to the police station i ll tell you
the workmen looked at him in amazement it time for us to go we are late come along alyoshka
we must lock up said the elder workman very well come along said $mr_raskolnikov$ indifferently and going out first he went slowly downstairs
at the entrance several people were standing staring at the passers by the two porters a peasant woman a #man# in a long coat and a few others
hey porter he cried in the gateway $mr_raskolnikov$ went straight up to them what do you want asked one of the porters
have you been to the police office i ve just been there what do you want is it open of course
is the assistant there he was there for a time what do you want $mr_raskolnikov$ made no reply but stood beside them lost in #thought#
he been to look at the flat said the elder workman coming forward which flat where we are at work
why have you washed away the blood says he there has been a murder here says he and i ve come to take it
and he began ringing at the bell all but broke it come to the police station says he i ll tell you everything there
he wouldnt leave us the porter looked at $mr_raskolnikov$ frowning and perplexed who are you he shouted as impressively as he could
i am $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ $mr_raskolnikov$ formerly a student i live in shil house not far from here flat number ask the porter he knows me
$mr_raskolnikov$ said all this in a lazy dreamy voice not turning round but looking intently into the darkening #street#
why have you been to the flat to look at it what is there to look at
take him straight to the police station the #man# in the long coat jerked in abruptly $mr_raskolnikov$ looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the same slow lazy tones come along
yes take him the #man# went on more confidently why was he going into that what in his mind eh
he not drunk but god knows what the matter with him muttered the workman but what do you want
the porter shouted again beginning to get angry in earnest why are you hanging about you funk the police station then said $mr_raskolnikov$ jeeringly
how funk it why are you hanging about he a rogue shouted the peasant woman why waste time talking to him
cried the other porter a huge peasant in a full open coat and with keys on his belt get along
he is a rogue and no mistake get along and seizing $mr_raskolnikov$ by the shoulder he flung him into the #street#
he lurched forward but recovered his footing looked at the spectators in silence and walked away strange #man# observed the workman
there are strange folks about nowadays said the woman you should have taken him to the police station all the same said the #man# in the long coat
better have nothing to do with him decided the big porter a regular rogue just what he wants you may be sure but once take him up you wont get rid of him
#thought# $mr_raskolnikov$ standing in the middle of the thoroughfare at the cross roads and he looked about him as though expecting from someone a decisive word
but no sound came all was dead and silent like the stones on which he walked dead to him to him alone
all at once at the #end# of the #street# two hundred yards away in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts
we know the sort shall i go there or not in the middle of the crowd stood a carriage a light gleamed in the middle of the #street#
he seemed to clutch at everything and smiled coldly when he recognised it for he had fully made up his mind to go to the police station and knew that it would all soon be over
an elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of spirited grey horses there was no one in it and the coachman had got off his box and stood by the horses were being held by the bridle
what is it $mr_raskolnikov$ turned to the right and went up to the crowd chapter vii a mass of people had gathered round the police standing in front
one of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on #something# lying close to the wheels everyone was talking shouting exclaiming the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating what a misfortune
$mr_raskolnikov$ pushed his way in as far as he could and succeeded at last in seeing the object of the commotion and interest
on the ground a #man# who had been run over lay apparently unconscious and covered with blood he was very badly dressed but not like a workman
good lord what a misfortune blood was flowing from his #head# and face his face was crushed mutilated and disfigured he was evidently badly injured
merciful heaven wailed the coachman what more could i do if i been driving fast or had not shouted to him but i was going quietly not in a hurry
everyone could see i was going along just like everybody else a drunken #man# cant walk straight we all know i saw him crossing the #street# staggering and almost falling
i shouted again and a second and a third time then i held the horses in but he fell straight under their feet
either he did it on purpose or he was very tipsy the horses are young and ready to take fright they started he screamed that made them worse
that how it happened that just how it was a voice in the crowd confirmed he shouted that true he shouted three times another voice declared
three times it was we all heard it shouted a third but the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened
it was evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere the police of course were in no little anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements
all they had to do was to take the injured #man# to the police station and the hospital no one knew his name
meanwhile $mr_raskolnikov$ had squeezed in and stooped closer over him the lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate #man# face he recognised him
i know him i know him he shouted pushing to the front it a government clerk retired from the service $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$
he lives close by in kozel house make haste for a doctor i will pay see he pulled money out of his #pocket# and showed it to the policeman
$mr_raskolnikov$ gave his own name and address and as earnestly as if it had been his father he besought the police to carry the unconscious $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ to his lodging at once
he was in violent agitation the police were glad that they had found out who the #man# was just here three houses away he said eagerly the house belongs to kozel a rich german
he was going home no doubt drunk i know him he is a drunkard he has a family there a wife #child# he has one daughter
it will take time to take him to the hospital and there is sure to be a doctor in the house
i ll pay i ll pay at least he will be looked after at home they will help him at once but he ll die before you get him to the hospital
he managed to slip #something# unseen into the policeman #hand# but the thing was straightforward and legitimate and in any case help was closer here
they raised the injured #man# people volunteered to help kozel house was thirty yards away $mr_raskolnikov$ walked behind carefully holding $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ #head# and showing the way
this way this way we must take him upstairs #head# foremost turn round i ll pay i ll make it worth your while he muttered
$katerina_ivanovna$ had just begun as she always did at every free moment walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and back again with her arms folded across her chest talking to herself and coughing
of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest girl $polenka$ a #child# of ten who though there was much she did not understand understood very well that her #mother# needed her and so always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost to appear to understand
this time $polenka$ was undressing her little brother who had been unwell all #day# and was going to bed the boy was waiting for her to take off his shirt which had to be washed at night
he was sitting straight and motionless on a chair with a silent serious face with his legs stretched out straight before him heels together and toes turned out
he was listening to what his #mother# was saying to his sister sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and wide open eyes just as all good little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed
the #door# on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other rooms and brought on long terrible #fit# of coughing in the poor consumptive woman
$katerina_ivanovna$ seemed to have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than ever
you wouldnt believe you cant imagine $polenka$ she said walking about the room what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa house and how this drunkard has brought me and will bring you all to ruin
papa was a civil colonel and only a #step# from being a governor so that everyone who came to see him said we look upon you ivan mihailovitch as our governor
a little girl still younger dressed literally in rags stood at the screen waiting for her turn when i when
she coughed violently oh cursed life she cried clearing her throat and pressing her #hand# to her breast when i when at the last ball at the marshal
princess bezzemelny saw me who gave me the blessing when your father and i were married $polenka$ she asked at once isnt that the pretty girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking up
you must mend that tear you must take your needle and darn it as i showed you or to morrow cough cough cough he will make the hole bigger she articulated with effort
he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to make me an offer next #day# but i thanked him in flattering expressions and told him that my heart had long been another
prince schegolskoy a kammerjunker had just come from petersburg then that other was your father polya papa was fearfully angry
lida said she to the youngest one you must manage without your chemise to night and lay your stockings out with it
is the water ready give me the shirt and the stockings i ll wash them together how is it that drunken vagabond doesnt come in
he has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish clout he has torn it to rags i do it all together so as not to have to work two nights running
oh dear cough cough cough cough again what this she cried noticing a crowd in the passage and the #man# who were pushing into her room carrying a burden
what is it what are they bringing mercy on us where are we to put him asked the policeman looking round when $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ unconscious and covered with blood had been carried in
on the sofa put him straight on the sofa with his #head# this way $mr_raskolnikov$ showed him run over in the road
drunk someone shouted in the passage $katerina_ivanovna$ stood turning white and gasping for breath the #child# were terrified little lida screamed rushed to $polenka$ and clutched at her trembling all over
he said speaking quickly he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage dont be frightened he will come to i told them bring him here
having laid $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ down $mr_raskolnikov$ flew to $katerina_ivanovna$ for god sake be calm dont be frightened i ve been here already you remember
he will come to i ll pay he done it this time $katerina_ivanovna$ cried despairingly and she rushed to her husband
she instantly placed under the luckless #man# #head# a pillow which no one had #thought# of and began undressing and examining him
she kept her #head# forgetting herself biting her trembling lips and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her
$mr_raskolnikov$ noticed at once that she was not one of those women who swoon easily $mr_raskolnikov$ meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor
there was a doctor it appeared next #door# but one i ve sent for a doctor he kept assuring $katerina_ivanovna$ dont be uneasy i ll pay
havent you water and give me a napkin or a towel anything as quick as you can he is injured but not killed believe me
$katerina_ivanovna$ ran to the window there on a broken chair in the #corner# a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood in readiness for washing her #child# and husband linen that night
we shall see what the doctor says this washing was done by $katerina_ivanovna$ at night at least twice a week if not oftener
for the family had come to such a pass that they were practically without change of linen and $katerina_ivanovna$ could not endure uncleanliness and rather than see dirt in the house she preferred to wear herself out at night working beyond her strength when the rest were asleep so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry by the morning
she took up the basin of water at $mr_raskolnikov$ request but almost fell down with her burden but the latter had already succeeded in finding a towel wetted it and began washing the blood off $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ face
$katerina_ivanovna$ stood by breathing painfully and pressing her #hand# to her breast she was in need of attention herself $mr_raskolnikov$ began to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured #man# brought here
if you dont find her at home leave word that her father has been run over and that she is to come here at once when she comes in
the policeman too stood in #hesitation# $polenka$ cried $katerina_ivanovna$ run to $sonia$ make haste run $polenka$ there put on the shawl
cried the little boy on the chair suddenly after which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity with round eyes his heels thrust forward and his toes spread out
the policemen left all except one who remained for a time trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs
almost all madame lippevechsel lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms of the flat at first they were squeezed together in the doorway but afterwards they overflowed into the room
run your fastest meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldnt have dropped a pin $katerina_ivanovna$ flew into a fury
you might let him die in peace at least she shouted at the crowd is it a spectacle for you to gape at
with cigarettes cough cough cough you might as well keep your hats on and there is one in his hat
get away you should respect the dead at least her cough choked her but her reproaches were not without result they evidently stood in some awe of $katerina_ivanovna$
the lodgers one after another squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden accident even in those nearest and dearest to the victim from which no living #man# is exempt even in #spite# of the sincerest sympathy and compassion
voices outside were heard however speaking of the hospital and saying that they no business to make a disturbance here
no business to die cried $katerina_ivanovna$ and she was rushing to the #door# to vent her wrath upon them but in the doorway came face to face with madame lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident and ran in to restore order
she was a particularly quarrelsome and irresponsible german ah my god she cried clasping her #hand# your husband drunken horses have trampled
$amalia_ludwigovna$ i beg you to recollect what you are saying $katerina_ivanovna$ began haughtily she always took a haughty tone with the landlady that she might remember her place and even now could not deny herself this satisfaction
to the hospital with him i am the landlady $amalia_ludwigovna$ i have you once before told that you to call me
you are not amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ but $amalia_ludwigovna$ and as i am not one of your despicable flatterers like mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ who laughing behind the #door# at this moment a laugh and a cry of they are at it again
$amalia_ludwigovna$ may not dare i am amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ was in fact audible at the #door# so i shall always call you $amalia_ludwigovna$ though i fail to understand why you dislike that name
you can see for yourself what has happened to $semyon_zaharovitch$ he is dying i beg you to close that #door# at once and to admit no one
let him at least die in peace or i warn you the governor general himself shall be informed of your conduct to morrow
everyone knows that $semyon_zaharovitch$ had many #friend# and protectors whom he abandoned himself from an honourable pride knowing his unhappy weakness but now she pointed to $mr_raskolnikov$ a generous young #man# has come to our assistance who has wealth and connections and whom $semyon_zaharovitch$ has known from a #child#
the prince knew me as a girl he remembers $semyon_zaharovitch$ well and has often been a benefactor to him you may rest assured $amalia_ludwigovna$
all this was uttered with extreme rapidity getting quicker and quicker but a cough suddenly cut short $katerina_ivanovna$ eloquence
at that instant the dying #man# recovered consciousness and uttered a groan she ran to him the injured #man# opened his eyes and without recognition or understanding gazed at $mr_raskolnikov$ who was bending over him
he drew deep slow painful breaths blood oozed at the #corner# of his mouth and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead
not recognising $mr_raskolnikov$ he began looking round uneasily $katerina_ivanovna$ looked at him with a sad but stern face and tears trickled from her eyes
my god his whole chest is crushed how he is bleeding she said in despair we must take off his clothes
turn a little $semyon_zaharovitch$ if you can she cried to him $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ recognised her a priest he articulated huskily
$katerina_ivanovna$ walked to the window laid her #head# against the window frame and exclaimed in despair oh cursed life a priest the dying #man# said again after a moment silence
they ve gone for him $katerina_ivanovna$ shouted to him he obeyed her shout and was silent with sad and timid eyes he looked for her she returned and stood by his pillow
soon his eyes rested on little lida his favourite who was shaking in the #corner# as though she were in a #fit# and staring at him with her wondering childish eyes
he seemed a little easier but not for long a ah he signed towards her uneasily he wanted to say #something#
what now cried $katerina_ivanovna$ barefoot barefoot he muttered indicating with frenzied eyes the #child# bare feet
the doctor came in a precise little old #man# a german looking about him mistrustfully he went up to the sick #man# took his pulse carefully felt his #head# and with the help of $katerina_ivanovna$ he unbuttoned the blood stained shirt and bared the injured #man# chest
be silent $katerina_ivanovna$ cried irritably you know why she is barefooted thank god the doctor exclaimed $mr_raskolnikov$ relieved it was gashed crushed and fractured several ribs on the right side were broken
on the left side just over the heart was a large sinister looking yellowish black bruise a cruel kick from the horse hoof the doctor frowned
the policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and turned round with it for thirty yards on the road
it wonderful that he has recovered consciousness the doctor whispered softly to $mr_raskolnikov$ what do you think of him
he asked he will die immediately is there really no #hope# not the faintest he is at the last gasp
his #head# is badly injured too hm i could bleed him if you like but it would be useless he is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes
at that moment other #step# were heard the crowd in the passage parted and the priest a little grey old #man# appeared in the doorway bearing the sacrament
better bleed him then if you like but i warn you it will be perfectly useless a policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident
the doctor changed places with him exchanging glances with him $mr_raskolnikov$ begged the doctor to remain a little while he shrugged his shoulders and remained
all stepped back the confession was soon over the dying #man# probably understood little he could only utter indistinct broken sounds
$katerina_ivanovna$ took little lida lifted the boy from the chair knelt down in the #corner# by the stove and made the #child# kneel in front of her
the little girl was still trembling but the boy kneeling on his little bare knees lifted his #hand# rhythmically crossing himself with precision and bowed down touching the floor with his forehead which seemed to afford him especial satisfaction
$katerina_ivanovna$ bit her lips and held back her tears she prayed too now and then pulling straight the boy shirt and managed to cover the girl bare shoulders with a kerchief which she took from the chest without rising from her knees or ceasing to pray
in the passage the crowd of spectators from all the flats on the #staircase# grew denser and denser but they did not venture beyond the threshold
meanwhile the #door# from the inner rooms was opened inquisitively again a single candle #end# lighted up the scene at that moment $polenka$ forced her way through the crowd at the #door#
she came in panting from running so fast took off her kerchief looked for her #mother# went up to her and said she coming i met her in the #street#
timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd and strange was her appearance in that room in the midst of want rags death and despair
she too was in rags her attire was all of the cheapest but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose
her #mother# made her kneel beside her $sonia$ stopped short in the doorway and looked about her bewildered unconscious of everything
she forgot her fourth #hand# gaudy silk dress so unseemly here with its ridiculous long train and her immense crinoline that filled up the whole doorway and her light coloured shoes and the parasol she brought with her though it was no use at night and the absurd round straw hat with its flaring flame coloured feather
under this rakishly tilted hat was a pale frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in terror $sonia$ was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair rather pretty with wonderful blue eyes
she looked intently at the bed and the priest she too was out of breath with running at last whispers some words in the crowd probably reached her
she looked down and took a #step# forward into the room still keeping close to the #door# the service was over
$katerina_ivanovna$ went up to her husband again the priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and consolation to $katerina_ivanovna$ on leaving
what am i to do with these she interrupted sharply and irritably pointing to the little ones god is merciful look to the most high for succour the priest began
ach he is merciful but not to us that a sin a sin madam observed the priest shaking his #head#
perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to compensate you at least for the loss of his earnings
and isnt that a sin cried $katerina_ivanovna$ pointing to the dying #man# you dont understand cried $katerina_ivanovna$ angrily waving her #hand#
and why should they compensate me why he was drunk and threw himself under the horses what earnings he brought us in nothing but #misery#
he drank everything away the drunkard he robbed us to get drink he wasted their lives and mine for drink and thank god he dying
one less to keep you must forgive in the hour of death that a sin madam such feelings are a great sin
$katerina_ivanovna$ was busy with the dying #man# she was giving him water wiping the blood and sweat from his #head# setting his pillow straight and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest
now she flew at him almost in a frenzy ah father that words and only words forgive if he not been run over he have come home to #day# drunk and his only shirt dirty and in rags
and he have fallen asleep like a log and i should have been sousing and rinsing till daybreak washing his rags and the #child# and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight
i should have been darning them that how i spend my nights what the use of talking of forgiveness i have forgiven as it is
she put her handkerchief to her lips and showed it to the priest pressing her other #hand# to her aching chest
a terrible hollow cough interrupted her words the handkerchief was covered with blood the priest bowed his #head# and said nothing
$sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ was in the last #agony# he did not take his eyes off the face of $katerina_ivanovna$ who was bending over him again
he kept trying to say #something# to her he began moving his tongue with difficulty and articulating indistinctly but $katerina_ivanovna$ understanding that he wanted to ask her forgiveness called peremptorily to him be silent
and the sick #man# was silent but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the doorway and he saw $sonia$
no need i know what you want to say till then he had not noticed her she was standing in the shadow in a #corner#
he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice in agitation turning his eyes in horror towards the #door# where his daughter was standing and trying to sit up
who that who that lie down lie do own cried $katerina_ivanovna$ with unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his elbow
he looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter as though not recognising her he had never seen her before in such attire
suddenly he recognised her crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and gaudy finery meekly awaiting her turn to say good bye to her dying father
he cried and he tried to hold out his #hand# to her but losing his balance he fell off the sofa face downwards on the floor
his face showed intense suffering $sonia$ daughter forgive they rushed to pick him up they put him on the sofa but he was dying
$sonia$ with a faint cry ran up embraced him and remained so without moving he died in her arms he got what he wanted $katerina_ivanovna$ cried seeing her husband dead body
well what to be done now how am i to bury him what can i give them to morrow to eat
$mr_raskolnikov$ went up to $katerina_ivanovna$ katerina $katerina_ivanovna$ he began last week your husband told me all his life and circumstances
from that #evening# when i learnt how devoted he was to you all and how he loved and respected you especially $katerina_ivanovna$ in #spite# of his unfortunate weakness from that #evening# we became #friend#
believe me he spoke of you with passionate reverence allow me now to do #something# to repay my debt to my dead #friend#
here are twenty #rouble# i think and if that can be of any assistance to you then i in short i will come again i will be sure to come again
i shall perhaps come again to morrow good bye and he went quickly out of the room squeezing his way through the crowd to the stairs
but in the crowd he suddenly jostled against $nikodim_fomitch$ who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions in person
they had not met since the scene at the police station but $nikodim_fomitch$ knew him instantly ah is that you
he asked him he dead answered $mr_raskolnikov$ the doctor and the priest have been all as it should have been
dont worry the poor woman too much she is in consumption as it is try and cheer her up if possible
you are a #kind# hearted #man# i know he added with a smile looking straight in his face but you are spattered with blood observed $nikodim_fomitch$ noticing in the lamplight some fresh stains on $mr_raskolnikov$ waistcoat
he walked down slowly and deliberately feverish but not conscious of it entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly within him
yes i covered with blood $mr_raskolnikov$ said with a peculiar air then he smiled nodded and went downstairs this sensation might be compared to that of a #man# condemned to death who has suddenly been pardoned
halfway down the #staircase# he was overtaken by the priest on his way home $mr_raskolnikov$ let him pass exchanging a silent greeting with him
he was just descending the last #step# when he heard rapid footsteps behind him someone overtook him it was $polenka$ she was running after him calling wait wait
he turned round she was at the bottom of the #staircase# and stopped short a #step# above him a dim light came in from the yard
$mr_raskolnikov$ could distinguish the #child# thin but pretty little face looking at him with a bright childish smile she had run after him with a message which she was evidently glad to give
tell me what is your name and where do you live she said hurriedly in a breathless voice he laid both #hand# on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of rapture
it was such a joy to him to look at her he could not have said why who sent you
sister $sonia$ sent me answered the girl smiling still more brightly i knew it was sister $sonia$ sent you
mamma sent me too when sister $sonia$ was sending me mamma came up too and said run fast $polenka$ do you love sister $sonia$
i love her more than #anyone# $polenka$ answered with a peculiar earnestness and her smile became graver and will you love me
by way of answer he saw the little girl face approaching him her full lips naïvely held out to kiss him
suddenly her arms as thin as sticks held him tightly her #head# rested on his shoulder and the little girl wept softly pressing her face against him
i am sorry for father she said a moment later raising her tear stained face and brushing away the tears with her #hand#
it nothing but misfortunes now she added suddenly with that peculiarly sedate air which #child# try hard to assume when they want to speak like grown up people
he loved lida most she went on very seriously without a smile exactly like grown up people he loved her because she is little and because she is ill too
did your father love you and he always used to bring her presents but he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture too she added with dignity
and #mother# never used to say anything but we knew that she liked it and father knew it too and #mother# wants to teach me french for it time my education began
i say my prayers to myself as i am a big girl now but $kolya$ and lida say them aloud with #mother#
first they repeat the ave maria and then another prayer lord forgive and bless sister $sonia$ and then another lord forgive and bless our second father
and do you know your prayers of course we do we knew them long ago for our elder father is dead and this is another one but we do pray for the other as well
i ll pray for you all the rest of my life the little girl declared hotly and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him warmly once more
$polenka$ my name is $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ pray sometimes for me too and thy servant $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ nothing more $mr_raskolnikov$ told her his name and address and promised to be sure to come next #day#
the #child# went away quite enchanted with him it was past ten when he came out into the #street# in five minutes he was standing on the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in
enough he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly i ve done with fancies imaginary terrors and phantoms life is real havent i lived just now
my life has not yet died with that old woman the kingdom of heaven to her and now enough madam leave me in peace
now for the reign of reason and light and of will and of strength and now we will see we will try our strength
he added defiantly as though challenging some power of darkness and i was ready to consent to live in a square of space
i am very weak at this moment but i believe my illness is all over i knew it would be over when i went out
by the way potchinkov house is only a few #step# away i certainly must go to $mr_razumihin$ even if it were not close by let him win his bet
strength strength is what one wants you can get nothing without it and strength must be won by strength that what they dont know he added proudly and self confidently
let us give him some satisfaction too no matter and he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge pride and self confidence grew continually stronger in him he was becoming a different #man# every moment
he did not know himself like a #man# catching at a straw he suddenly felt that he too could live that there was still life for him that his life had not died with the old woman
what was it had happened to work this revolution in him perhaps he was in too great a hurry with his conclusions but he did not think of that
but i did ask her to remember thy servant $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ in her prayers the idea struck him well that was in case of emergency he added and laughed himself at his boyish sally
he easily found $mr_razumihin$ the new lodger was already known at potchinkov and the porter at once showed him the way
he was in the best of spirits half way upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big gathering of people
the #door# was wide open on the stairs he could hear exclamations and discussion $mr_razumihin$ room was fairly large the company consisted of fifteen people
$mr_raskolnikov$ stopped in the entry where two of the landlady servants were busy behind a screen with two samovars bottles plates and dishes of pie and savouries brought up from the landlady kitchen
at the first glance it was apparent that he had had a great deal to drink and though no amount of liquor made $mr_razumihin$ quite drunk this time he was perceptibly affected by it
listen $mr_raskolnikov$ hastened to say i ve only just come to tell you you ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to him
$mr_raskolnikov$ sent in for $mr_razumihin$ he ran out delighted i cant come in i am so weak that i shall fall down directly
and so good #evening# and good bye come and see me to morrow do you know what i ll see you home if you say you re weak yourself you must
and your visitors who is the curly headed one who has just peeped out he goodness only knows some #friend# of uncle i expect or perhaps he has come without being invited
i ll leave uncle with them he is an invaluable person pity i cant introduce you to him now but confound them all now
they wont notice me and i need a little fresh air for you ve come just in the nick of time another two minutes
and i should have come to blows they are talking such a lot of wild stuff you simply cant imagine what #man# will say
though why shouldnt you imagine dont we talk nonsense ourselves and let them that the way to learn not to wait a minute i ll fetch $zossimov$
you must go to bed at once he pronounced examining the patient as far as he could and take #something# for the night
$zossimov$ pounced upon $mr_raskolnikov$ almost greedily he showed a special interest in him soon his face brightened will you take it
i got it ready some time ago a powder two if you like answered $mr_raskolnikov$ the powder was taken at once
it a good thing you are taking him home observed $zossimov$ to $mr_razumihin$ we shall see how he is to morrow to #day#
he not at all amiss a considerable change since the afternoon live and learn do you know what $zossimov$ whispered to me when we were coming out
$mr_razumihin$ blurted out as soon as they were in the #street# i wont tell you everything brother because they are such fools
$zossimov$ told me to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me and afterwards i am to tell him about it for he got a notion in his #head# that you are mad or close on it
in the first place you ve three times the brains he has in the second if you are not mad you neednt care a hang that he has got such a wild idea and thirdly that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental #disease# and what brought him to this conclusion about you was your conversation to #day# with $mr_zametov$
only fancy $mr_zametov$ told you all about it yes and he did well now i understand what it all means and so does $mr_zametov$
well the fact is $rodya$ the #point# is i am a little drunk now but that no matter the #point# is that this idea you understand was just being hatched in their brains
that is no one ventured to say it aloud because the idea is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter that bubble burst and gone for ever
i gave $mr_zametov$ a bit of a thrashing at the time that between ourselves brother please dont let out a hint that you know of it i ve noticed he is a ticklish subject it was at luise $katerina_ivanovna$
you understand but why are they such fools but to #day# to #day# it all cleared up that $ilya_petrovitch$ is at the bottom of it
he took advantage of your fainting at the police station but he is ashamed of it himself now i know that
$mr_raskolnikov$ listened greedily $mr_razumihin$ was drunk enough to talk too freely i fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint said $mr_raskolnikov$
no need to explain that and it wasnt the paint only the fever had been coming on for a month $zossimov$ testifies to that
but how crushed that boy is now you wouldnt believe i am not worth his little finger he says yours he means
he has good feelings at times brother but the lesson the lesson you gave him to #day# in the palais de cristal that was too good for anything
you almost convinced him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense and then you suddenly put out your tongue at him there now what do you make of it
you frightened him at first you know he nearly went into convulsions it was perfect he is crushed annihilated now it was masterly by jove it what they deserve
ah that i wasnt there he was hoping to see you awfully $porfiry_petrovitch$ too wants to make your acquaintance ah
he too but why did they put me down as mad oh not mad i must have said too much brother
now it clear why it did interest you knowing all the circumstances and how that irritated you and worked in with your illness
what struck him you see was that only that subject seemed to interest you i am a little drunk brother only confound him he has some idea of his own
i tell you he mad on mental #disease# but dont you mind him for half a minute both were silent
listen $mr_razumihin$ began $mr_raskolnikov$ i want to tell you plainly i ve just been at a death bed a clerk who died
i gave them all my money and besides i ve just been kissed by someone who if i had killed #anyone# would just the same
in fact i saw someone else there with a flame coloured feather but i am talking nonsense i am very weak support me
we shall be at the stairs directly what the matter what the matter with you $mr_razumihin$ asked anxiously
i am a little giddy but that not the #point# i am so sad so sad like a woman look what that
they were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs at the level of the landlady #door# and they could as a fact see from below that there was a light in $mr_raskolnikov$ #garret#
look look what is it dont you see a light in my room you see through the crack
queer $nastasya$ perhaps observed $mr_razumihin$ she is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago but
i dont care good bye what do you mean i am coming with you we ll come in together i know we are going in together but i want to shake #hand# here and say good bye to you here
so give me your #hand# good bye what the matter with you $rodya$ nothing come along you shall be witness
they began mounting the stairs and the idea struck $mr_razumihin$ that perhaps $zossimov$ might be right after all ah i ve upset him with my chatter
he muttered to himself when they reached the #door# they heard voices in the room what is it cried $mr_razumihin$
$mr_raskolnikov$ was the first to open the #door# he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway dumbfoundered his #mother# and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an hour and a half for him
why had he never expected never #thought# of them though the news that they had started were on their way and would arrive immediately had been repeated to him only that #day#
they had spent that hour and a half plying $nastasya$ with questions she was standing before them and had told them everything by now
they were beside themselves with alarm when they heard of his running away to #day# ill and as they understood from her #story# delirious
good heavens what had become of him both had been weeping both had been in anguish for that hour and a half
a cry of joy of ecstasy greeted $mr_raskolnikov$ entrance both rushed to him but he stood like one dead a sudden intolerable sensation struck him like a thunderbolt
he did not lift his arms to embrace them he could not his #mother# and sister clasped him in their arms kissed him laughed and cried
$mr_razumihin$ who was standing in the doorway flew into the room seized the sick #man# in his strong arms and in a moment had him on the sofa
he took a #step# tottered and fell to the ground fainting anxiety cries of horror moans it nothing nothing he cried to the #mother# and sister it only a faint a mere trifle
only just now the doctor said he was much better that he is perfectly well water see he is coming to himself he is all right again
and seizing $dounia$ by the arm so that he almost dislocated it he made her bend down to see that he is all right again
they had heard already from $nastasya$ all that had been done for their $rodya$ during his illness by this very competent young #man# as $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ $mr_raskolnikov$ called him that #evening# in conversation with $dounia$
the #mother# and sister looked on him with emotion and gratitude as their providence part iii chapter i $mr_raskolnikov$ got up and sat down on the sofa
he waved his #hand# weakly to $mr_razumihin$ to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations he was addressing to his #mother# and sister took them both by the #hand# and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking
his #mother# was alarmed by his expression it revealed an emotion agonisingly poignant and at the same time #something# immovable almost insane
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ began to cry $avdotya_romanovna$ was pale her #hand# trembled in her brother go home with him he said in a broken voice pointing to $mr_razumihin$ good bye till to morrow to morrow everything
is it long since you arrived this #evening# $rodya$ answered $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ the train was awfully late but $rodya$ nothing would induce me to leave you now
i will spend the night here near you dont torture me he said with a gesture of irritation i will stay with him cried $mr_razumihin$ i wont leave him for a moment
bother all my visitors let them rage to their hearts content my uncle is presiding there how how can i thank you
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was beginning once more pressing $mr_razumihin$ #hand# but $mr_raskolnikov$ interrupted her again i cant have it i cant have it
come mamma come out of the room at least for a minute $dounia$ whispered in dismay we are distressing him that evident
he repeated irritably dont worry me enough go away i cant stand it maynt i look at him after three years wept $pulcheria_alexandrovna$
stay he stopped them again you keep interrupting me and my ideas get muddled have you seen $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ no $rodya$ but he knows already of our arrival
we have heard $rodya$ that $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ was so #kind# as to visit you today $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ added somewhat timidly
yes he was so #kind# $dounia$ i promised $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ i throw him downstairs and told him to go to hell
$rodya$ what are you saying surely you dont mean to tell us $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ began in alarm but she stopped looking at $dounia$
both of them had heard of the quarrel from $nastasya$ so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it and were in painful perplexity and suspense
$dounia$ $mr_raskolnikov$ continued with an effort i dont want that marriage so at the first opportunity to morrow you must refuse $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ so that we may never hear his name again
$avdotya_romanovna$ was looking attentively at her brother waiting for what would come next good heavens cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$
brother think what you are saying $avdotya_romanovna$ began impetuously but immediately checked herself you are not #fit# to talk now perhaps you are tired she added gently
you think i am delirious no you are marrying $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ for my sake but i wont accept the sacrifice and so write a letter before to morrow to refuse him
let me read it in the morning and that will be the #end# of it that i cant do the girl cried offended what right
have you $dounia$ you are hasty too be quiet to morrow dont you see the #mother# interposed in dismay better come away
he is raving $mr_razumihin$ cried tipsily or how would he dare to morrow all this nonsense will be over to #day# he certainly did drive him away
that was so and $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ got angry too he made speeches here wanted to show off his learning and he went out crest fallen
then it true cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ good bye till to morrow brother said $dounia$ compassionately let us go #mother# good bye $rodya$
do you hear sister he repeated after them making a last effort i am not delirious this marriage is an infamy let me act like a scoundrel but you mustnt
one is enough and though i am a scoundrel i wouldnt own such a sister it me or $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ go now
but you re out of your mind despot roared $mr_razumihin$ but $mr_raskolnikov$ did not and perhaps could not answer he lay down on the sofa and turned to the #wall# utterly exhausted
$avdotya_romanovna$ looked with interest at $mr_razumihin$ her black eyes flashed $mr_razumihin$ positively started at her glance $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ stood overwhelmed
nothing would induce me to go she whispered in despair to $mr_razumihin$ i will stay somewhere here escort $dounia$ home
you ll spoil everything $mr_razumihin$ answered in the same whisper losing patience come out on to the stairs anyway $nastasya$ show a light
i assure you he went on in a half whisper on the stairs that he was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon
do you understand the doctor himself even he gave way and left him so as not to irritate him i remained downstairs on guard but he dressed at once and slipped off
and he will slip off again if you irritate him at this time of night and will do himself some mischief
what are you saying and $avdotya_romanovna$ cant possibly be left in those lodgings without you just think where you are staying
that blackguard $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ couldnt find you better lodgings but you know i ve had a little to drink and that what makes me
but i ll go to the landlady here $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ insisted i ll beseech her to find some #corner# for $dounia$ and me for the night
swear dont mind it i cant leave him like that i cannot this conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady #door#
half an hour earlier while he was bringing $mr_raskolnikov$ home he had indeed talked too freely but he was aware of it himself and his #head# was clear in #spite# of the vast quantities he had imbibed
now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy and all that he had drunk seemed to fly to his #head# with redoubled effect
he stood with the two ladies seizing both by their #hand# persuading them and giving them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech and at almost every word he uttered probably to emphasise his arguments he squeezed their #hand# painfully as in a vise
$nastasya$ lighted them from a #step# below $mr_razumihin$ was in extraordinary excitement he stared at $avdotya_romanovna$ without the least regard for good manners
they sometimes pulled their #hand# out of his huge bony paws but far from noticing what was the matter he drew them all the closer to him
if they told him to jump #head# foremost from the #staircase# he would have done it without #thought# or #hesitation# in their service
though $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ felt that the young #man# was really too eccentric and pinched her #hand# too much in her anxiety over her $rodya$
but though $avdotya_romanovna$ shared her anxiety and was not of timorous disposition she could not see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm
it was only the unbounded confidence inspired by $nastasya$ account of her brother queer #friend# which prevented her from trying to run away from him and to persuade her #mother# to do the same
she looked on his presence as providential and was unwilling to notice all his peculiarities she realised too that even running away was perhaps impossible now
ten minutes later however she was considerably reassured it was characteristic of $mr_razumihin$ that he showed his true nature at once whatever mood he might be in so that people quickly saw the sort of #man# they had to deal with
if you stay though you are his #mother# you ll drive him to a frenzy and then goodness knows what will happen
you cant go to the landlady that perfect nonsense he cried listen i ll tell you what i ll do $nastasya$ will stay with him now and i ll conduct you both home
then i ll run straight back here and a quarter of an hour later on my word of honour i ll bring you news how he is whether he is asleep and all that
you cant be in the #street# alone petersburg is an awful place in that way but no matter then listen
a lot of #friend# there all drunk i ll fetch $zossimov$ that the doctor who is looking after him he is there too but he is not drunk he is not drunk he is never drunk
i ll drag him to $rodya$ and then to you so that you ll get two reports in the hour from the doctor you understand from the doctor himself
then i ll run home in a twinkling i ve that a very different thing from my account of him if there anything wrong i swear i ll bring you here myself but if it all right you go to bed
and i ll spend the night here in the passage he wont hear me and i ll tell $zossimov$ to sleep at the landlady to be at #hand#
but the landlady is out of the question it all right for me but it out of the question for you she wouldnt take you for she
she be jealous on my account of $avdotya_romanovna$ and of you too if you want to know of $avdotya_romanovna$ certainly
which is better for him you or the doctor so come home then for she a fool she is an absolutely absolutely unaccountable character
but i am a fool too no matter come along do you trust me come do you trust me or not
he has saved $rodya$ already and if the doctor really will consent to spend the night here what could be better
let us go #mother# said $avdotya_romanovna$ he will certainly do what he has promised you see you you understand me because you are an angel
$mr_razumihin$ cried in ecstasy let us go $nastasya$ fly upstairs and sit with him with a light i ll come in a quarter of an hour
though $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was not perfectly convinced she made no further resistance $mr_razumihin$ gave an arm to each and drew them down the stairs
he still made her uneasy as though he was competent and good natured was he capable of carrying out his promise he seemed in such a condition
$mr_razumihin$ broke in upon her #thought# guessing them as he strolled along the pavement with huge #step# so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him a fact he did not observe however
ah i see you think i am in such a condition nonsense that is i am drunk like a fool but that not it i am not drunk from wine
it seeing you has turned my #head# but dont mind me dont take any notice i am talking nonsense i am not worthy of you
the minute i ve taken you home i ll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over my #head# in the gutter here and then i shall be all right
i am utterly unworthy of you if only you knew how i love you both dont laugh and dont be angry
you may be angry with #anyone# but not with me i am his #friend# and therefore i am your #friend# too i want to be
i had a presentiment last year there was a moment though it wasnt a presentiment really for you seem to have fallen from heaven
and i expect i shant sleep all night $zossimov$ was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad that why he mustnt be irritated
what do you say cried the #mother# did the doctor really say that asked $avdotya_romanovna$ alarmed
yes but it not so not a bit of it he gave him some medicine a powder i saw it and then your coming here
ah it would have been better if you had come to morrow it a good thing we went away and in an hour $zossimov$ himself will report to you about everything
he is not drunk and i shant be drunk and what made me get so tight because they got me into an argument damn them
i ve sworn never to argue they talk such trash i almost came to blows i ve left my uncle to preside would you believe they insist on complete absence of individualism and that just what they relish
not to be themselves to be as unlike themselves as they can that what they regard as the highest #point# of progress
if only their nonsense were their own but as it is listen $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ interrupted timidly but it only added fuel to the flames
what do you think shouted $mr_razumihin$ louder than ever you think i am attacking them for talking nonsense not a bit
i like them to talk nonsense that #man# one privilege over all creation through error you come to the truth i am a #man# because i err
you never reach any truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and fourteen and a fine thing too in its way but we cant even make mistakes on our own account
talk nonsense but talk your own nonsense and i ll kiss you for it to go wrong in one own way is better than to go right in someone else
in the first case you are a #man# in the second you re no better than a bird truth wont escape you but life can be cramped
in science development #thought# invention ideals aims liberalism judgment #experience# and everything everything everything we are still in the preparatory class at school
there have been examples and what are we doing now we prefer to live on other people ideas it what we are used to
am i right am i right cried $mr_razumihin$ pressing and shaking the two ladies #hand# oh mercy i do not know cried poor $pulcheria_alexandrovna$
yes yes though i dont agree with you in everything added $avdotya_romanovna$ earnestly and at once uttered a cry for he squeezed her #hand# so painfully
yes you say yes well after that you you he cried in a transport you are a fount of goodness purity sense and perfection
give me your #hand# you give me yours too i want to kiss your #hand# here at once on my knees
and he fell on his knees on the pavement fortunately at that time deserted leave off i entreat you what are you doing
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ cried greatly distressed get up get up said $dounia$ laughing though she too was upset not for anything till you let me kiss your #hand#
that it enough i get up and we ll go on i am a luckless fool i am unworthy of you and drunk and i am ashamed
i am not worthy to love you but to do homage to you is the duty of every #man# who is not a perfect beast
and i ve done homage here are your lodgings and for that alone $rodya$ was right in driving your $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ away
how dare he how dare he put you in such lodgings it a scandal do you know the sort of people they take in here
and you his betrothed you are his betrothed yes well then i ll tell you your fiancé is a scoundrel excuse me $mr_razumihin$ you are forgetting
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was beginning yes yes you are right i did forget myself i am ashamed of it $mr_razumihin$ made haste to apologise
but but you cant be angry with me for speaking so for i speak sincerely and not because hm hm
that would be disgraceful in fact not because i in hm well anyway i wont say why i darent but we all saw to #day# when he came in that that #man# is not of our sort
not because he had his hair curled at the barber not because he was in such a hurry to show his wit but because he is a spy a speculator because he is a skin flint and a buffoon
that evident do you think him clever no he is a fool a fool and is he a match for you
he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms though all my #friend# there are drunk yet they are all honest and though we do talk a lot of trash and i do too yet we shall talk our way to the truth at last for we are on the right path while $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ is not on the right path
though i ve been calling them all sorts of names just now i do respect them all though i dont respect $mr_zametov$ i like him for he is a puppy and that bullock $zossimov$ because he is an honest #man# and knows his work
good heavens do you see ladies but enough it all said and forgiven is it forgiven well then let go on
i know this corridor i ve been here there was a scandal here at number where are you here which number
in a quarter of an hour i ll come back with news and half an hour later i ll bring $zossimov$ you ll see
eight well lock yourselves in for the night then dont let anybody in good bye i ll run good heavens $dounia$ what is going to happen said $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay
dont worry yourself #mother# said $dounia$ taking off her hat and cape god has sent this gentleman to our aid though he has come from a drinking party
we can depend on him i assure you and all that he has done for $rodya$ ah $dounia$ goodness knows whether he will come
how could i bring myself to leave $rodya$ and how different how different i had fancied our meeting how sullen he was as though not pleased to see us
tears came into her eyes no it not that #mother# you didnt see you were crying all the time
and how he talked to you $dounia$ said the #mother# looking timidly at her daughter trying to read her #thought# and already half consoled by $dounia$ standing up for her brother which meant that she had already forgiven him
he is quite unhinged by serious illness that the reason ah that illness what will happen what will happen i am sure he will think better of it to morrow she added probing her further
and i am sure that he will say the same to morrow about that $avdotya_romanovna$ said finally and of course there was no going beyond that
for this was a #point# which $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was afraid to discuss $dounia$ went up and kissed her #mother# the latter warmly embraced her without speaking
then she sat down to wait anxiously for $mr_razumihin$ return timidly watching her daughter who walked up and down the room with her arms folded lost in #thought#
this walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of $avdotya_romanovna$ and the #mother# was always afraid to break in on her daughter mood at such moments
yet apart from his eccentric condition many people would have #thought# it justified if they had seen $avdotya_romanovna$ especially at that moment when she was walking to and fro with folded arms pensive and melancholy
$avdotya_romanovna$ was remarkably good looking she was tall strikingly well proportioned strong and self reliant the latter quality was apparent in every gesture though it did not in the least detract from the grace and softness of her movements
$mr_razumihin$ of course was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation for $avdotya_romanovna$ in face she resembled her brother but she might be described as really beautiful
her hair was dark brown a little lighter than her brother there was a proud light in her almost black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness
her mouth was rather small the full red lower lip projected a little as did her chin it was the only irregularity in her beautiful face but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty expression
her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay but how well smiles how well youthful lighthearted irresponsible laughter suited her face
it was natural enough that a warm open simple hearted honest giant like $mr_razumihin$ who had never seen #anyone# like her and was not quite sober at the time should lose his #head# immediately
besides as chance would have it he saw $dounia$ for the first time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at meeting him
afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation at her brother insolent cruel and ungrateful words and his fate was sealed
he had spoken the truth moreover when he blurted out in his drunken talk on the stairs that praskovya pavlovna $mr_raskolnikov$ eccentric landlady would be jealous of $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ as well as of $avdotya_romanovna$ on his account
although $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was forty three her face still retained traces of her former beauty she looked much younger than her age indeed which is almost always the case with women who retain serenity of spirit sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age
she was pale but it was a healthy pallor her face was radiant with freshness and vigour we may add in parenthesis that to preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age
her hair had begun to grow grey and thin there had long been little crow foot wrinkles round her eyes her cheeks were hollow and sunken from anxiety and grief and yet it was a handsome face
she was $dounia$ over again twenty years older but without the projecting underlip $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was emotional but not sentimental timid and yielding but only to a certain #point#
she could give way and accept a great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions but there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty principle and the deepest convictions which nothing would induce her to cross
exactly twenty minutes after $mr_razumihin$ departure there came two subdued but hurried knocks at the #door# he had come back
i wont come in i havent time he hastened to say when the #door# was opened he sleeps like a top soundly quietly and god grant he may sleep ten hours
now i am fetching $zossimov$ he will report to you and then you better turn in i can see you are too tired to do anything
$nastasya$ with him i told her not to leave till i came and he ran off down the corridor
what a very competent and devoted young #man# cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ exceedingly delighted he seems a splendid person $avdotya_romanovna$ replied with some warmth resuming her walk up and down the room
it was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor and another knock at the #door# both women waited this time completely relying on $mr_razumihin$ promise he actually had succeeded in bringing $zossimov$
$zossimov$ had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to go to $mr_raskolnikov$ but he came reluctantly and with the greatest suspicion to see the ladies mistrusting $mr_razumihin$ in his exhilarated condition
but his vanity was at once reassured and flattered he saw that they were really expecting him as an oracle he stayed just ten minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting $pulcheria_alexandrovna$
he did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the slightest #desire# to enter into more personal relations with the two ladies
remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of $avdotya_romanovna$ he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and addressed himself solely to $pulcheria_alexandrovna$
he spoke with marked sympathy but with the reserve and extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation all this gave him extraordinary inward satisfaction
according to his observations the patient illness was due partly to his unfortunate material surroundings during the last few months but it had partly also a moral origin was so to speak the product of several material and moral influences anxieties apprehensions troubles certain ideas and so on
he declared that he #thought# the invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily noticing stealthily that $avdotya_romanovna$ was following his words with close attention $zossimov$ allowed himself to enlarge on this theme
on $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ anxiously and timidly inquiring as to some suspicion of insanity he replied with a composed and candid smile that his words had been exaggerated that certainly the patient had some fixed idea #something# approaching a monomania he $zossimov$ was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine but that it must be recollected that until to #day# the patient had been in delirium and and that no doubt the presence of his family would have a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind if only all fresh shocks can be avoided he added significantly
then he got up took leave with an impressive and affable bow while blessings warm gratitude and entreaties were showered upon him and $avdotya_romanovna$ spontaneously offered her #hand# to him
he went out exceedingly pleased with his visit and still more so with himself we ll talk to morrow go to bed at once
$mr_razumihin$ said in conclusion following $zossimov$ out i ll be with you to morrow morning as early as possible with my report
that a fetching little girl $avdotya_romanovna$ remarked $zossimov$ almost licking his lips as they both came out into the #street#
fetching you said fetching roared $mr_razumihin$ and he flew at $zossimov$ and seized him by the throat
if you ever dare do you understand do you understand he shouted shaking him by the collar and squeezing him against the #wall#
let me go you drunken devil said $zossimov$ struggling and when he had let him go he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw
do you hear $mr_razumihin$ stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection of course i am an ass he observed sombre as a storm cloud but still
they walked along in silence and only when they were close to $mr_raskolnikov$ lodgings $mr_razumihin$ broke the silence in considerable anxiety
listen he said you re a first rate fellow but among your other failings you re a loose fish that i know and a dirty one too
you are a feeble nervous wretch and a mass of whims you re getting fat and lazy and cant deny yourself anything and i call that dirty because it leads one straight into the dirt
you ve let yourself get so slack that i dont know how it is you are still a good even a devoted doctor
you are another no brother not at all such another i am not dreaming of any folly you a doctor sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your patients
in another three or four years you wont get up for your patients but hang it all that not the #point#
you are going to spend to night in the landlady flat here hard work i ve had to persuade her and i ll be in the kitchen
so here a chance for you to get to know her better it not as you think there not a trace of anything of the sort brother
but i dont think here you have modesty brother silence bashfulness a savage virtue and yet she sighing and melting like wax simply melting
save me from her by all that unholy she most prepossessing i ll repay you i ll do anything $zossimov$ laughed more violently than ever
well you are smitten but what am i to do with her it wont be much trouble i assure you
talk any rot you like to her as long as you sit by her and talk you re a doctor too try curing her of #something#
i swear you wont regret it she has a piano and you know i strum a little i have a song there a genuine russian one i shed hot tears
she likes the genuine article and well it all began with that song now you re a regular performer a maître a rubinstein
i assure you you wont regret it but have you made her some promise #something# signed a promise of marriage perhaps
nothing nothing absolutely nothing of the #kind# besides she is not that sort at all tchebarov tried that well then drop her
but i cant drop her like that why cant you well i cant that all about it there an element of attraction here brother
then why have you fascinated her i havent fascinated her perhaps i was fascinated myself in my folly but she wont care a straw whether it you or i so long as somebody sits beside her sighing
look here you are good at mathematics and working at it now begin teaching her the integral calculus upon my soul i not joking i in earnest it ll be just the same to her
i talked to her once for two #day# at a time about the prussian house of lords for one must talk of #something# she just sighed and perspired
i cant explain the position brother she will gaze at you and sigh for a whole year together and you mustnt talk of love she bashful to hysterics but just let her see you cant tear yourself away
that enough it fearfully comfortable you re quite at home you can read sit lie about write you may even venture on a kiss if you re careful
but what do i want with her ach i cant make you understand you see you are made for each other
i have often been reminded of you you ll come to it in the #end# so does it matter whether it sooner or later
there an attraction here here you have the #end# of the world an anchorage a quiet haven the navel of the earth the three fishes that are the foundation of the world the essence of pancakes of savoury fish pies of the #evening# samovar of soft sighs and warm shawls and hot stoves to sleep on as snug as though you were dead and yet you re alive the advantages of both at once
there the feather bed element here brother ach and not only that well hang it brother what stuff i talking it bedtime listen
i sometimes wake up at night so i ll go in and look at him but there no need it all right
dont you worry yourself yet if you like you might just look in once too but if you notice anything delirium or fever wake me at once
but there cant be chapter ii $mr_razumihin$ waked up next morning at eight clock troubled and serious he found himself confronted with many new and unlooked for perplexities
he remembered every detail of the previous #day# and he knew that a perfectly novel #experience# had befallen him that he had received an impression unlike anything he had known before
at the same time he recognised clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly unattainable so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it and he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties bequeathed him by that thrice accursed yesterday
the most awful recollection of the previous #day# was the way he had shown himself base and mean not only because he had been drunk but because he had taken advantage of the young girl position to abuse her fiancé in his stupid jealousy knowing nothing of their mutual relations and obligations and next to nothing of the #man# himself
he had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that and what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner
who had asked for his opinion was it thinkable that such a creature as $avdotya_romanovna$ would be marrying an unworthy #man# for money
so there must be #something# in him the lodgings but after all how could he know the character of the lodgings
he was furnishing a flat foo how despicable it all was and what justification was it that he was drunk such a stupid excuse was even more degrading
in wine is truth and the truth had all come out that is all the uncleanness of his coarse and envious heart
and would such a dream ever be permissible to him $mr_razumihin$ what was he beside such a girl he the drunken noisy braggart of last night
$mr_razumihin$ blushed desperately at the very idea and suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of $avdotya_romanovna$
was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical a juxtaposition that was simply intolerable he brought his fist down heavily on the kitchen stove hurt his #hand# and sent one of the bricks flying
of course he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of self abasement of course all these infamies can never be wiped out or smoothed over
and so it useless even to think of it and i must go to them in silence and do my duty in silence too and not ask forgiveness and say nothing for all is lost now
and yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual he hadnt another suit if he had had perhaps he wouldnt have put it on
but in any case he could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven he had no right to offend the feelings of others especially when they were in need of his assistance and asking him to see them
i would have made a #point# of not putting it on he brushed his clothes carefully his linen was always decent in that respect he was especially clean
when it came to the question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not praskovya pavlovna had capital razors that had been left by her late husband the question was angrily answered in the negative
he washed that morning scrupulously he got some soap from $nastasya$ he washed his hair his neck and especially his #hand# let it stay as it is
and the worst of it was he was so coarse so dirty he had the manners of a pothouse and and even admitting that he knew he had some of the essentials of a gentleman
what if they think that i shaved on purpose to they certainly would think so not on any account what was there in that to be proud of
everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that and all the same he remembered he too had done little things not exactly dishonest and yet
and what #thought# he sometimes had hm and to set all that beside $avdotya_romanovna$ confound it so be it
well he make a #point# then of being dirty greasy pothouse in his manners and he wouldnt care he be worse
he was engaged in such monologues when $zossimov$ who had spent the night in praskovya pavlovna parlour came in he was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first
$mr_razumihin$ informed him that $mr_raskolnikov$ was sleeping like a dormouse $zossimov$ gave orders that they shouldnt wake him and promised to see him again about eleven
if he is still at home he added damn it all if one cant control one patients how is one to cure them
they are coming i think said $mr_razumihin$ understanding the object of the question and they will discuss their family affairs no doubt
do you know whether he will go to them or whether they are coming here i ll be off you as the doctor have more right to be here than i
but i am not a father confessor i shall come and go away i ve plenty to do besides looking after them
one thing worries me interposed $mr_razumihin$ frowning on the way home i talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him
all sorts of things and amongst them that you were afraid that he might become insane you told the ladies so too
i know it was stupid you may beat me if you like did you think so seriously that nonsense i tell you how could i think it seriously
you yourself described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to him and we added fuel to the fire yesterday you did that is with your #story# about the painter it was a nice conversation when he was perhaps mad on that very #point#
if only i known what happened then at the police station and that some wretch had insulted him with this suspicion
hm i would not have allowed that conversation yesterday these monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole hill and see their fancies as solid realities
why i know one case in which a hypochondriac a #man# of forty cut the throat of a little boy of eight because he couldnt endure the jokes he made every #day# at table
as far as i remember it was $mr_zametov$ #story# that cleared up half the mystery to my mind and in this case his rags the insolent police officer the fever and this suspicion
all that working upon a #man# half frantic with hypochondria and with his morbid exceptional vanity that may well have been the starting #point# of illness
and by the way that $mr_zametov$ certainly is a nice fellow but hm he shouldnt have told all that last night
well bother it all he is an awful chatterbox but whom did he tell it to you and me
and $porfiry_petrovitch$ what does that matter and by the way have you any influence on them his #mother# and sister
tell them to be more careful with him to #day# they ll get on all right $mr_razumihin$ answered reluctantly why is he so set against this $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
a #man# with money and she doesnt seem to dislike him and they havent a farthing i suppose eh but what business is it of yours
$mr_razumihin$ cried with annoyance how can i tell whether they ve a farthing ask them yourself and perhaps you ll find out
foo what an ass you are sometimes last night wine has not gone off yet good bye thank your praskovya pavlovna from me for my night lodging
she locked herself in made no reply to my bonjour through the #door# she was up at seven clock the samovar was taken into her from the kitchen
i was not vouchsafed a personal interview at nine clock precisely $mr_razumihin$ reached the lodgings at bakaleyev house both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience
they had risen at seven clock or earlier he entered looking as black as night bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it
he had reckoned without his host $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ fairly rushed at him seized him by both #hand# and was almost kissing them
he glanced timidly at $avdotya_romanovna$ but her proud countenance wore at that moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness such complete and unlooked for respect in place of the sneering looks and ill disguised contempt he had expected that it threw him into greater #confusion# than if he had been met with abuse
hearing that everything was going well and that $rodya$ had not yet waked $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ declared that she was glad to hear it because she had #something# which it was very very necessary to talk over beforehand
then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation to have it with them they had waited to have it with him
$avdotya_romanovna$ rang the bell it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter and they asked him to bring tea which was served at last but in such a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed
$mr_razumihin$ vigorously attacked the lodgings but remembering $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ stopped in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ questions which showered in a continual stream upon him
he talked for three quarters of an hour being constantly interrupted by their questions and succeeded in describing to them all the most important facts he knew of the last year of $mr_raskolnikov$ life concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness
fortunately there was a subject for conversation and he made haste to snatch at it he omitted however many things which were better omitted including the scene at the police station with all its consequences
they listened eagerly to his #story# and when he #thought# he had finished and satisfied his listeners he found that they considered he had hardly begun
tell me tell me what do you think excuse me i still dont know your name $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ put in hastily
i should like very very much to know $dmitri_prokofitch$ how he looks on things in general now that is how can i explain what are his likes and dislikes
$dmitri_prokofitch$ is he always so irritable tell me if you can what are his #hope# and so to say his dreams
under what influences is he now in a word i should like ah #mother# how can he answer all that at once
observed $dounia$ good heavens i had not expected to find him in the least like this $dmitri_prokofitch$ naturally answered $mr_razumihin$
i have no #mother# but my uncle comes every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me even in appearance though he is a clever #man# and your three years separation means a great deal
i have known $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ for a year and a half he is morose gloomy proud and haughty and of late and perhaps for a long time before he has been suspicious and fanciful
what am i to tell you he has a noble nature and a #kind# heart he does not like showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his heart freely
sometimes though he is not at all morbid but simply cold and inhumanly callous it as though he were alternating between two characters
sometimes he is fearfully reserved he says he is so busy that everything is a hindrance and yet he lies in bed doing nothing
he doesnt jeer at things not because he hasnt the wit but as though he hadnt time to waste on such trifles
he never listens to what is said to him he is never interested in what interests other people at any given moment
he thinks very highly of himself and perhaps he is right well what more i think your arrival will have a most beneficial influence upon him
god grant it may cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ distressed by $mr_razumihin$ account of her $rodya$ and $mr_razumihin$ ventured to look more boldly at $avdotya_romanovna$ at last
$avdotya_romanovna$ sat at the table listening attentively then got up again and began walking to and fro with her arms folded and her lips compressed occasionally putting in a question without stopping her walk
he glanced at her often while he was talking but only for a moment and looked away again at once she had the same habit of not listening to what was said
she was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a white transparent scarf round her neck $mr_razumihin$ soon detected signs of extreme #poverty# in their belongings
had $avdotya_romanovna$ been dressed like a queen he felt that he would not be afraid of her but perhaps just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the #misery# of her surroundings his heart was filled with dread and he began to be afraid of every word he uttered every gesture he made which was very trying for a #man# who already felt diffident
you ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother character and have told it impartially i am glad
i #thought# that you were too uncritically devoted to him observed $avdotya_romanovna$ with a smile i think you are right that he needs a woman care she added thoughtfully
i didnt say so but i daresay you are right only what he loves no one and perhaps he never will $mr_razumihin$ declared decisively
you mean he is not capable of love do you know $avdotya_romanovna$ you are awfully like your brother in everything indeed
he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise but remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with #confusion#
$avdotya_romanovna$ couldnt help laughing when she looked at him you may both be mistaken about $rodya$ $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ remarked slightly piqued
what $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ writes in this letter and what you and i have supposed may be mistaken but you cant imagine $dmitri_prokofitch$ how moody and so to say capricious he is
i am not talking of our present difficulty $dounia$ i never could depend on what he would do when he was only fifteen
well for instance do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave me a shock that nearly killed me
and i am sure that he might do #something# now that nobody else would think of doing when he had the idea of marrying that girl what was her name his landlady daughter
do you suppose that my tears my entreaties my illness my possible death from grief our #poverty# would have made him pause
did you hear about that affair asked $avdotya_romanovna$ do you suppose $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ continued warmly no he would calmly have disregarded all obstacles
and yet it isnt that he doesnt love us he has never spoken a word of that affair to me $mr_razumihin$ answered cautiously
but i did hear #something# from praskovya pavlovna herself though she is by no means a gossip and what i heard certainly was rather strange
i only learned that the marriage which only failed to take place through the girl death was not at all to praskovya pavlovna liking
they say too the girl was not at all pretty in fact i am told positively ugly and such an invalid and queer
and what did you hear both the ladies asked at once well nothing very special but she seems to have had some good qualities
she must have had some good qualities or it quite inexplicable she had no money either and he wouldnt have considered her money
but it always difficult to judge in such matters i am sure she was a good girl $avdotya_romanovna$ observed briefly
though i dont know which of them would have caused most #misery# to the other he to her or she to him $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ concluded
then she began tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous #day# with $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ hesitating and continually glancing at $dounia$ obviously to the latter annoyance
god forgive me i simply rejoiced at her death this incident more than all the rest evidently caused her uneasiness even consternation
$mr_razumihin$ described it in detail again but this time he added his own conclusions he openly blamed $mr_raskolnikov$ for intentionally insulting $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ not seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness
he had planned it before his illness he added i think so too $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ agreed with a dejected air
but she was very much surprised at hearing $mr_razumihin$ express himself so carefully and even with a certain respect about $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
$avdotya_romanovna$ too was struck by it so this is your opinion of $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ could not resist asking
i can have no other opinion of your daughter future husband $mr_razumihin$ answered firmly and with warmth and i dont say it simply from vulgar politeness but because simply because $avdotya_romanovna$ has of her own free will deigned to accept this #man#
if i spoke so rudely of him last night it was because i was disgustingly drunk and mad besides yes mad crazy i lost my #head# completely and this morning i am ashamed of it
he crimsoned and ceased speaking $avdotya_romanovna$ flushed but did not break the silence she had not uttered a word from the moment they began to speak of $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
without her support $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ obviously did not know what to do at last faltering and continually glancing at her daughter she confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance
you see $dmitri_prokofitch$ she began i ll be perfectly open with $dmitri_prokofitch$ $dounia$ of course #mother# said $avdotya_romanovna$ emphatically
this is what it is she began in haste as though the permission to speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind
very early this morning we got a note from $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ in reply to our letter announcing our arrival
he promised to meet us at the station you know instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these lodgings and to show us the way and he sent a message that he would be here himself this morning
but this morning this note came from him you better read it yourself there is one #point# in it which worries me very much
you will soon see what that is and tell me your candid opinion $dmitri_prokofitch$ you know $rodya$ character better than #anyone# and no one can advise us better than you can
$dounia$ i must tell you made her decision at once but i still dont feel sure how to act and i
$mr_razumihin$ opened the note which was dated the previous #evening# and read as follows dear madam $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ i have the honour to inform you that owing to unforeseen obstacles i was rendered unable to meet you at the railway station i sent a very competent person with the same object in view
i likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with you to morrow morning by business in the senate that does not admit of delay and also that i may not intrude on your family circle while you are meeting your son and $avdotya_romanovna$ her brother
i shall have the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings not later than to morrow #evening# at eight clock precisely and herewith
i venture to present my earnest and i may add imperative request that $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ may not be present at our interview as he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my visit to him in his illness yesterday and moreover since i #desire# from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation upon a certain #point# in regard to which i wish to learn your own interpretation
i have the honour to inform you in anticipation that if in #spite# of my request i meet $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ i shall be compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to blame
i write on the assumption that $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ who appeared so ill at my visit suddenly recovered two hours later and so being able to leave the house may visit you also
i was confirmed in that belief by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken #man# who was run over and has since died to whose daughter a young woman of notorious behaviour he gave twenty five #rouble# on the pretext of the funeral which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to raise that sum
herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable daughter $avdotya_romanovna$ i beg you to accept the respectful homage of your humble servant $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
i ve been waiting for your opinion what am i to do now $dmitri_prokofitch$ began $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ almost weeping
how can i ask $rodya$ not to come yesterday he insisted so earnestly on our refusing $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and now we are ordered not to receive $rodya$
he will come on purpose if he knows and what will happen then act on $avdotya_romanovna$ decision $mr_razumihin$ answered calmly at once
she says that it would be best at least not that it would be best but that it absolutely necessary that $rodya$ should make a #point# of being here at eight clock and that they must meet
i didnt want even to show him the letter but to prevent him from coming by some stratagem with your help because he is so irritable
besides i dont understand about that drunkard who died and that daughter and how he could have given the daughter all the money
oh dear me she says goodness knows what she says she doesnt explain her object which which cost you such sacrifice #mother# put in $avdotya_romanovna$
he was not himself yesterday $mr_razumihin$ said thoughtfully if you only knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday though there was sense in it too
he did say #something# as we were going home yesterday #evening# about a dead #man# and a girl but i didnt understand a word
hm but last night i myself the best thing #mother# will be for us to go to him ourselves
besides it getting late good heavens it past ten she cried looking at a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin venetian chain and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her dress
and there i assure you we shall see at once what to be done a present from her fiancé #thought# $mr_razumihin$
we must start $dounia$ we must start her #mother# cried in a flutter he will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday from our coming so late
merciful heavens while she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle $dounia$ too put on her things
her gloves as $mr_razumihin$ noticed were not merely shabby but had holes in them and yet this evident #poverty# gave the two ladies an air of special dignity which is always found in people who know how to wear poor clothes
the queen who mended her stockings in prison he #thought# must have looked then every inch a queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levées
my god exclaimed $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ little did i think that i should ever fear seeing my son my darling darling $rodya$
$mr_razumihin$ looked reverently at $dounia$ and felt proud of escorting her i am afraid $dmitri_prokofitch$ she added glancing at him timidly
dont be afraid #mother# said $dounia$ kissing her better have faith in him oh dear i have faith in him but i havent slept all night exclaimed the poor woman
they came out into the #street# do you know $dounia$ when i dozed a little this morning i dreamed of $marfa_petrovna$
she came up to me took my #hand# and shook her #head# at me but so sternly as though she were blaming me
she was all in white is that a good omen oh dear me you dont know $dmitri_prokofitch$ that $marfa_petrovna$ dead
no i didnt know who is $marfa_petrovna$ she died suddenly and only fancy afterwards mamma put in $dounia$
he doesnt know who $marfa_petrovna$ is ah you dont know and i was thinking that you knew all about us
i look upon you really as a providence for us and so i took it for granted that you knew all about us
forgive me $dmitri_prokofitch$ i dont know what i am thinking about these last few #day# i look on you as a relation
dont be angry with me for saying so dear me what the matter with your right #hand# have you knocked it
yes i bruised it muttered $mr_razumihin$ overjoyed i sometimes speak too much from the heart so that $dounia$ finds fault with me
but dear me what a cupboard he lives in i wonder whether he is awake does this woman his landlady consider it a room
listen you say he does not like to show his feelings so perhaps i shall annoy him with my weaknesses do advise me $dmitri_prokofitch$ how am i to treat him
dont question him too much about anything if you see him frown dont ask him too much about his health he doesnt like that
i feel quite distracted you know ah $dmitri_prokofitch$ how hard it is to be a #mother# but here are the stairs
#mother# you are quite pale dont distress yourself darling said $dounia$ caressing her then with flashing eyes she added he ought to be happy at seeing you and you are tormenting yourself so
the ladies slowly followed $mr_razumihin$ who went on before and when they reached the landlady #door# on the fourth storey they noticed that her #door# was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching them from the darkness within
what an awful #staircase# wait i ll peep in and see whether he has waked up when their eyes met the #door# was suddenly shut with such a slam that $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ almost cried out
chapter iii he is well quite well $zossimov$ cried cheerfully as they entered he had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place as before on the sofa
$mr_raskolnikov$ was sitting in the opposite #corner# fully dressed and carefully washed and combed as he had not been for some time past
$mr_raskolnikov$ really was almost well as compared with his condition the #day# before but he was still pale listless and sombre
the room was immediately crowded yet $nastasya$ managed to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen he looked like a wounded #man# or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering
his brows were knitted his lips compressed his eyes feverish he spoke little and reluctantly as though performing a duty and there was a restlessness in his movements
he only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete the impression of a #man# with a painful abscess or a broken arm
the pale sombre face lighted up for a moment when his #mother# and sister entered but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering in place of its listless dejection
the light soon died away but the look of suffering remained and $zossimov$ watching and studying his patient with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise noticed in him no joy at the arrival of his #mother# and sister but a sort of bitter hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable torture
he saw later that almost every word of the following conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it
but at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous #day# had like a monomaniac fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word
yes i see myself now that i am almost well said $mr_raskolnikov$ giving his #mother# and sister a kiss of welcome which made $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ radiant at once
and i dont say this as i did yesterday he said addressing $mr_razumihin$ with a friendly pressure of his #hand#
yes indeed i am quite surprised at him to #day# began $zossimov$ much delighted at the ladies entrance for he had not succeeded in keeping up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes
in another three or four #day# if he goes on like this he will be just as before that is as he was a month ago or two or perhaps even three
this has been coming on for a long while eh confess now that it has been perhaps your own fault
he added with a tentative smile as though still afraid of irritating him it is very possible answered $mr_raskolnikov$ coldly
now that one can talk to you i should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the elementary so to speak fundamental causes tending to produce your morbid condition in that case you will be cured if not it will go from bad to worse
i should say too continued $zossimov$ with zest that your complete recovery depends solely on yourself these fundamental causes i dont know but they must be known to you
you are an intelligent #man# and must have observed yourself of course i fancy the first stage of your derangement coincides with your leaving the university
you must not be left without occupation and so work and a definite aim set before you might i fancy be very beneficial
yes yes you are perfectly right i will make haste and return to the university and then everything will go smoothly
$zossimov$ who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before the ladies was certainly somewhat mystified when glancing at his patient he observed unmistakable mockery on his face
this lasted an instant however $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ began at once thanking $zossimov$ especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night
what he saw you last night $mr_raskolnikov$ asked as though startled then you have not slept either after your journey
ach $rodya$ that was only till two clock $dounia$ and i never go to bed before two at home i dont know how to thank him either $mr_raskolnikov$ went on suddenly frowning and looking down
setting aside the question of payment forgive me for referring to it he turned to $zossimov$ i really dont know what i have done to deserve such special attention from you
i simply dont understand it and and it weighs upon me indeed because i dont understand it i tell you so candidly
assume that you are my first patient well we fellows just beginning to practise love our first patients as if they were our #child# and some almost fall in love with them
i say nothing about him added $mr_raskolnikov$ pointing to $mr_razumihin$ though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble
dont be irritated $zossimov$ forced himself to laugh and of course i am not rich in patients
if he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no trace of sentimentality in him but #something# indeed quite the opposite
what nonsense he is talking why you are in a sentimental mood to #day# are you shouted $mr_razumihin$ but $avdotya_romanovna$ noticed it
she was intently and uneasily watching her brother as for you #mother# i dont dare to speak he went on as though repeating a lesson learned by heart
it is only to #day# that i have been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here yesterday waiting for me to come back
when he had said this he suddenly held out his #hand# to his sister smiling without a word but in this smile there was a flash of real unfeigned feeling
$dounia$ caught it at once and warmly pressed his #hand# overjoyed and thankful it was the first time he had addressed her since their dispute the previous #day#
the #mother# face lighted up with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken reconciliation yes that is what i love him for
$mr_razumihin$ exaggerating it all muttered to himself with a vigorous turn in his chair he has these movements
what generous impulses he has and how simply how delicately he put an #end# to all the misunderstanding with his sister simply by holding out his #hand# at the right minute and looking at her like that
and how well he does it all the #mother# was thinking to herself and what fine eyes he has and how fine his whole face is
he is even better looking than $dounia$ but good heavens what a suit how terribly he dressed vasya the messenger boy in afanasy ivanitch shop is better dressed
i could rush at him and hug him weep over him but i am afraid oh dear he so strange he talking kindly but i afraid
oh $rodya$ you wouldnt believe she began suddenly in haste to answer his words to her how unhappy $dounia$ and i were yesterday
why what am i afraid of now that it all over and done with and we are quite happy again i can tell you
fancy we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace you and that woman ah here she is good morning $nastasya$
she told us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away from the doctor in delirium and they were looking for you in the #street#
you cant imagine how we felt i couldnt help thinking of the tragic #end# of lieutenant potanchikov a #friend# of your father s
you cant remember him $rodya$ who ran out in the same way in a high fever and fell into the well in the court yard and they couldnt pull him out till next #day#
of course we exaggerated things we were on the #point# of rushing to find $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ to ask him to help
because we were alone utterly alone she said plaintively and stopped short suddenly recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ although we are quite happy again
yes yes of course it very annoying $mr_raskolnikov$ muttered in reply but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that $dounia$ gazed at him in perplexity
what else was it i wanted to say he went on trying to recollect oh yes #mother# and you too
$dounia$ please dont think that i didnt mean to come and see you to #day# and was waiting for you to come first
what are you saying $rodya$ cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ she too was surprised is he answering us as a duty
$dounia$ wondered is he being reconciled and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating a lesson
i ve only just waked up and wanted to go to you but was delayed owing to my clothes i forgot yesterday to ask her
$nastasya$ to wash out the blood i ve only just dressed blood what blood $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ asked in alarm
it was when i was wandering about yesterday rather delirious i chanced upon a #man# who had been run over a clerk
oh nothing dont be uneasy delirious but you remember everything $mr_razumihin$ interrupted that true $mr_raskolnikov$ answered with special carefulness
i remember everything even to the slightest detail and yet why i did that and went there and said that i cant clearly explain now
a familiar phenomenon interposed $zossimov$ actions are sometimes performed in a masterly and most cunning way while the direction of the actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions it like a dream
perhaps it a good thing really that he should think me almost a madman #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$ why people in perfect health act in the same way too observed $dounia$ looking uneasily at $zossimov$
in that sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen but with the slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder for we must draw a line
there is some truth in your observation the latter replied a normal #man# it is true hardly exists among dozens perhaps hundreds of thousands hardly one is to be met with
at the word madman carelessly dropped by $zossimov$ in his chatter on his favourite subject everyone frowned $mr_raskolnikov$ sat seeming not to pay attention plunged in #thought# with a strange smile on his pale lips
he was still meditating on #something# well what about the #man# who was run over i interrupted you $mr_razumihin$ cried hastily
what $mr_raskolnikov$ seemed to wake up oh i got spattered with blood helping to carry him to his lodging
by the way mamma i did an unpardonable thing yesterday i was literally out of my mind i gave away all the money you sent me to his wife for the funeral
she a widow now in consumption a poor creature three little #child# starving nothing in the house there a daughter too
perhaps you have given it yourself if you seen them but i had no right to do it i admit especially as i knew how you needed the money yourself
to help others one must have the right to do it or else crevez chiens si vous êtes pas contents
he laughed that right isnt it $dounia$ no it not answered $dounia$ firmly bah you too have ideals he muttered looking at her almost with hatred and smiling sarcastically
and if you reach a line you wont overstep you will be unhappy and if you overstep it maybe you will be still unhappier
i ought to have considered that well that praiseworthy and it better for you but all that nonsense he added irritably vexed at being carried away
i only meant to say that i beg your forgiveness #mother# he concluded shortly and abruptly that enough $rodya$ i am sure that everything you do is very good said his #mother# delighted
there was a certain constraint in all this conversation and in the silence and in the reconciliation and in the forgiveness and all were feeling it
it is as though they were afraid of me $mr_raskolnikov$ was thinking to himself looking askance at his #mother# and sister
dont be too sure he answered twisting his mouth into a smile a silence followed $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent
yet in their absence i seemed to love them so much flashed through his mind do you know $rodya$ $marfa_petrovna$ is dead $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ suddenly blurted out
what $marfa_petrovna$ oh mercy on us $marfa_petrovna$ $mr_svidrigaïlov$ i wrote you so much about her a a yes i remember
so she dead oh really he roused himself suddenly as if waking up what did she die of
only imagine quite suddenly $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ answered hurriedly encouraged by his curiosity on the very #day# i was sending you that letter
would you believe it that awful #man# seems to have been the cause of her death they say he beat her dreadfully
why were they on such bad terms he asked addressing his sister not at all quite the contrary indeed
in fact all those seven years of their married life he gave way to her too much so indeed in many cases
with her he was always very patient considerate even all of a sudden he seems to have lost patience then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven years
you seem to be defending him $dounia$ no no he an awful #man# i can imagine nothing more awful $dounia$ answered almost with a shudder knitting her brows and sinking into #thought#
that had happened in the morning $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ went on hurriedly and directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner
she always used to drive to the town in such cases she ate a very good dinner i am told after the beating
that was always her habit and immediately after dinner so as not to be late in starting she went to the bath house
they have a cold spring there and she used to bathe in it regularly every #day# and no sooner had she got into the water when she suddenly had a stroke
you see she was undergoing some treatment with baths i should think so said $zossimov$ and did he beat her badly
but i dont know why you want to tell us such gossip #mother# said $mr_raskolnikov$ irritably as it were in #spite# of himself
what does that matter put in $dounia$ m ah my dear i dont know what to talk about broke from $pulcheria_alexandrovna$
why are you all afraid of me he asked with a constrained smile that certainly true said $dounia$ looking directly and sternly at her brother
#mother# was crossing herself with terror as she came up the stairs his face worked as though in convulsion
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ began overwhelmed you see coming here i was dreaming all the way in the train how we should meet how we should talk over everything together
ach what are you saying $dounia$ dont be angry please $rodya$ why did you say that $dounia$ and i was so happy
i did not notice the journey but what am i saying i am happy now you should not $dounia$ i am happy now simply in seeing you $rodya$
hush #mother# he muttered in #confusion# not looking at her but pressing her #hand# we shall have time to speak freely of everything
as he said this he was suddenly overwhelmed with #confusion# and turned pale again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly chill over his soul
again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to him that he had just told a fearful lie that he would never now be able to speak freely of everything that he would never again be able to speak of anything to #anyone#
the anguish of this #thought# was such that for a moment he almost forgot himself he got up from his seat and not looking at #anyone# walked towards the #door#
what are you about cried $mr_razumihin$ clutching him by the arm he sat down again and began looking about him in silence
they were all looking at him in perplexity but what are you all so dull for he shouted suddenly and quite unexpectedly
do say #something# what the use of sitting like this come do speak let us talk we meet together and sit in silence
come anything thank god i was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning again said $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ crossing herself
what is the matter $rodya$ asked $avdotya_romanovna$ distrustfully oh nothing i remembered #something# he answered and suddenly laughed
well if you remembered #something# that all right i was beginning to think muttered $zossimov$ getting up from the sofa
it is time for me to be off i will look in again perhaps if i can he made his bows and went out
yes excellent splendid well educated intelligent $mr_raskolnikov$ began suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity and a liveliness he had not shown till then
what an excellent #man# observed $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ i cant remember where i met him before my illness i believe i have met him somewhere
and this is a good #man# too he nodded at $mr_razumihin$ do you like him $dounia$ he asked her and suddenly for some unknown reason laughed
very much answered $dounia$ foo what a pig you are $mr_razumihin$ protested blushing in terrible #confusion# and he got up from his chair
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ smiled faintly but $mr_raskolnikov$ laughed aloud where are you off to i must go you need not at all
stay $zossimov$ has gone so you must dont go what the time is it twelve clock what a pretty watch you have got $dounia$
but why are you all silent again i do all the talking it was a present from $marfa_petrovna$ answered $dounia$
and a very expensive one added $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ a ah what a big one hardly like a lady
i like that sort said $dounia$ so it is not a present from her fiancé #thought# $mr_razumihin$ and was unreasonably delighted
i #thought# it was $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ present observed $mr_raskolnikov$ no he has not made $dounia$ any presents yet
he said suddenly looking at his #mother# who was disconcerted by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it
a ah and do you remember #mother# i was in love and wanted to get married oh yes my dear
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ exchanged glances with $dounia$ and $mr_razumihin$ m yes what shall i tell you i dont remember much indeed
she was fond of giving alms to the poor and was always dreaming of a nunnery and once she burst into tears when she began talking to me about it
she was such a sickly girl he went on growing dreamy and looking down again quite an invalid yes yes i remember
i remember very well she was an ugly little thing i really dont know what drew me to her then i think it was because she was always ill
if she had been lame or hunchback i believe i should have liked her better still he smiled dreamily yes it was a sort of spring delirium
no it was not only spring delirium said $dounia$ with warm feeling he fixed a strained intent look on his sister but did not hear or did not understand her words
then completely lost in #thought# he got up went up to his #mother# kissed her went back to his place and sat down
you love her even now said $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ touched her now oh yes you ask about her no that all now as it were in another world and so long ago
and indeed everything happening here seems somehow far away he looked attentively at them you now i seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away
but goodness knows why we are talking of that and what the use of asking about it he added with annoyance and biting his nails fell into dreamy silence again
what a wretched lodging you have $rodya$ it like a tomb said $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ suddenly breaking the oppressive silence
i am sure it quite half through your lodging you have become so melancholy my lodging he answered listlessly
yes the lodging had a great deal to do with it i #thought# that too if only you knew though what a strange thing you said just now #mother# he said laughing strangely
a little more and their companionship this #mother# and this sister with him after three years absence this intimate tone of conversation in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything would have been beyond his power of endurance
but there was one urgent matter which must be settled one way or the other that #day# so he had decided when he woke
listen $dounia$ he began gravely and drily of course i beg your pardon for yesterday but i consider it my duty to tell you again that i do not withdraw from my chief #point#
now he was glad to remember it as a means of escape it is me or $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ if i am a scoundrel you must not be
one is enough if you marry $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ i cease at once to look on you as a sister $rodya$ rodya it is the same as yesterday again $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ cried mournfully
and why do you call yourself a scoundrel i cant bear it you said the same yesterday brother $dounia$ answered firmly and with the same dryness
in all this there is a mistake on your part i #thought# it over at night and found out the mistake
it is all because you seem to fancy i am sacrificing myself to someone and for someone that is not the case at all
i am simply marrying for my own sake because things are hard for me though of course i shall be glad if i succeed in being useful to my family
but that is not the chief motive for my decision she is lying he #thought# to himself biting his nails vindictively
proud creature she wont admit she wants to do it out of charity too haughty oh base characters they even love as though they hate
oh how i hate them all in fact continued $dounia$ i am marrying $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ because of two evils i choose the less
i intend to do honestly all he expects of me so i am not deceiving him why did you smile just now
she too flushed and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes all he asked with a malignant grin
within certain limits both the manner and form of $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ courtship showed me at once what he wanted he may of course think too well of himself but i #hope# he esteems me too
why are you laughing again and why are you blushing again you are lying sister you are intentionally lying simply from feminine obstinacy simply to hold your own against me
so you are selling yourself for money and so in any case you are acting basely and i am glad at least that you can blush for it
you cannot respect $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ i have seen him and talked with him it is not true i am not lying cried $dounia$ losing her composure
i would not marry him if i were not convinced that he esteems me and thinks highly of me i would not marry him if i were not firmly convinced that i can respect him
fortunately i can have convincing proof of it this very #day# and such a marriage is not a vileness as you say
and even if you were right if i really had determined on a vile action is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that
why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either it is despotism it is tyranny if i ruin #anyone# it is only myself
i am not committing a murder why do you look at me like that why are you so pale $rodya$ darling what the matter
good heavens you have made him faint cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ no no nonsense it nothing a little giddiness not fainting you have fainting on the brain
in what way will you get convincing proof to #day# that you can respect him and that he esteems you as you said
h yes what was i saying oh yes i think you said to #day# #mother# show $rodya$ $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ letter said $dounia$
with trembling #hand# $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ gave him the letter he took it with great interest but before opening it he suddenly looked with a sort of wonder at $dounia$
it is strange he said slowly as though struck by a new idea what am i making such a fuss for
he said this as though to himself but said it aloud and looked for some time at his sister as though puzzled
what is it all about marry whom you like he opened the letter at last still with the same look of strange wonder on his face
then slowly and attentively he began reading and read it through twice $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ showed marked anxiety and all indeed expected #something# particular
what surprises me he began after a short pause handing the letter to his #mother# but not addressing #anyone# in particular is that he is a business #man# a lawyer and his conversation is pretentious indeed and yet he writes such an uneducated letter
they all started they had expected #something# quite different but they all write like that you know $mr_razumihin$ observed abruptly
have you read it yes we showed him $rodya$ we consulted him just now $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ began embarrassed that just the jargon of the courts $mr_razumihin$ put in
legal documents are written like that to this #day# legal yes it just legal business language not so very uneducated and not quite educated business language
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap education he is proud indeed of having made his own way $avdotya_romanovna$ observed somewhat offended by her brother tone
you seem to be offended sister at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the letter and to think that i speak of such trifling matters on purpose to annoy you
it is quite the contrary an observation apropos of the style occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand
there is one expression blame yourselves put in very significantly and plainly and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if i am present
that threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon you both if you are disobedient and to abandon you now after summoning you to petersburg
can one resent such an expression from $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ as we should if he he pointed to $mr_razumihin$ had written it or $zossimov$ or one of us
well if he proud of it he has reason i dont deny it well what do you think no
answered $dounia$ with more animation i saw clearly that it was too naïvely expressed and that perhaps he simply has no skill in writing
that is a true criticism brother i did not expect indeed it is expressed in legal style and sounds coarser than perhaps he intended
but i must disillusion you a little there is one expression in the letter one slander about me and rather a contemptible one
i gave the money last night to the widow a woman in consumption crushed with trouble and not on the pretext of the funeral but simply to pay for the funeral and not to the daughter a young woman as he writes of notorious behaviour whom i saw last night for the first time in my life but to the widow
it is expressed again in legal jargon that is to say with a too obvious display of the aim and with a very naïve eagerness
in all this i see a too hasty #desire# to slander me and to raise dissension between us he is a #man# of intelligence but to act sensibly intelligence is not enough
it all shows the #man# and i dont think he has a great esteem for you i tell you this simply to warn you because i sincerely wish for your good
$dounia$ did not reply her resolution had been taken she was only awaiting the #evening# then what is your decision $rodya$
asked $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ who was more uneasy than ever at the sudden new businesslike tone of his talk what decision
you see $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ writes that you are not to be with us this #evening# and that he will go away if you come
that of course is not for me to decide but for you first if you are not offended by such a request and secondly by $dounia$ if she too is not offended
so will you come i will do what you think best he added drily $dounia$ has already decided and i fully agree with her $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ hastened to declare
i decided to ask you $rodya$ to urge you not to fail to be with us at this interview said $dounia$
will you come yes i will ask you too to be with us at eight clock she said addressing $mr_razumihin$
#mother# i am inviting him too quite right $dounia$ well since you have decided added $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ so be it
i shall feel easier myself i do not like concealment and deception better let us have the whole truth $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ may be angry or not now
chapter iv at that moment the #door# was softly opened and a young girl walked into the room looking timidly about her
everyone turned towards her with surprise and curiosity at first sight $mr_raskolnikov$ did not recognise her it was $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$
he had seen her yesterday for the first time but at such a moment in such surroundings and in such a dress that his memory retained a very different image of her
now she was a modestly and poorly dressed young girl very young indeed almost like a #child# with a modest and refined manner with a candid but somewhat frightened looking face
she was wearing a very plain indoor dress and had on a shabby old fashioned hat but she still carried a parasol
unexpectedly finding the room full of people she was not so much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness like a little #child#
she was even about to retreat oh it you said $mr_raskolnikov$ extremely astonished and he too was confused he at once recollected that his #mother# and sister knew through $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ letter of some young woman of notorious behaviour
he had only just been protesting against $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ calumny and declaring that he had seen the girl last night for the first time and suddenly she had walked in
all this passed vaguely and fleetingly through his brain but looking at her more intently he saw that the humiliated creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her
he remembered too that he had not protested against the expression of notorious behaviour when she made a movement to retreat in terror it sent a pang to his heart
i did not expect you he said hurriedly with a look that made her stop please sit down you come no doubt from $katerina_ivanovna$
at $sonia$ entrance $mr_razumihin$ who had been sitting on one of $mr_raskolnikov$ three chairs close to the #door# got up to allow her to enter
$mr_raskolnikov$ had at first shown her the place on the sofa where $zossimov$ had been sitting but feeling that the sofa which served him as a bed was too familiar a place he hurriedly motioned her to $mr_razumihin$ chair
allow me not there sit here you sit here he said to $mr_razumihin$ putting him on the sofa $sonia$ sat down almost shaking with terror and looked timidly at the two ladies
at the #thought# of it she was so frightened that she hurriedly got up again and in utter #confusion# addressed $mr_raskolnikov$
it was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she could sit down beside them i i have come for one minute
forgive me for disturbing you she began falteringly i come from $katerina_ivanovna$ and she had no one to send
$katerina_ivanovna$ told me to beg you to be at the service in the morning at mitrofanievsky and then to us to her to do her the honour
she told me to beg you $sonia$ stammered and ceased speaking i will try certainly most certainly answered $mr_raskolnikov$ he too stood up and he too faltered and could not finish his #sentence#
you are perhaps in a hurry but please be so #kind# spare me two minutes and he drew up a chair for her
$sonia$ sat down again and again timidly she took a hurried frightened look at the two ladies and dropped her eyes
please sit down he said suddenly i want to talk to you $mr_raskolnikov$ pale face flushed a shudder passed over him his eyes glowed
#mother# he said firmly and insistently this is $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ the daughter of that unfortunate mr $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ who was run over yesterday before my eyes and of whom i was just telling you
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ glanced at $sonia$ and slightly screwed up her eyes in #spite# of her embarrassment before $rodya$ urgent and challenging look she could not deny herself that satisfaction
$dounia$ gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl face and scrutinised her with perplexity $sonia$ hearing herself introduced tried to raise her eyes again but was more embarrassed than ever
i wanted to ask you said $mr_raskolnikov$ hastily how things were arranged yesterday you were not worried by the police for instance
no that was all right it was too evident the cause of death they did not worry us only the lodgers are angry
why at the body remaining so long you see it is hot now so that to #day# they will carry it to the cemetery into the chapel until to morrow
she begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to morrow for the service and then to be present at the funeral lunch
at first $katerina_ivanovna$ was unwilling but now she sees herself that it necessary to #day# then she is giving a funeral lunch
yes just a little she told me to thank you very much for helping us yesterday but for you we should have had nothing for the funeral
all at once her lips and chin began trembling but with an effort she controlled herself looking down again during the conversation $mr_raskolnikov$ watched her carefully
she could not have been called pretty but her blue eyes were so clear and when they lighted up there was such a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help being attracted
she had a thin very thin pale little face rather irregular and angular with a sharp little nose and chin her face and her whole figure indeed had another peculiar characteristic
in #spite# of her eighteen years she looked almost a little girl almost a #child# and in some of her gestures this childishness seemed almost absurd
but has $katerina_ivanovna$ been able to manage with such small means does she even mean to have a funeral lunch
$mr_raskolnikov$ asked persistently keeping up the conversation the coffin will be plain of course and everything will be plain so it wont cost much
$katerina_ivanovna$ and i have reckoned it all out so that there will be enough left and $katerina_ivanovna$ was very anxious it should be so
you know one cant it a comfort to her she is like that you know i understand i understand of course why do you look at my room like that
you gave us everything yesterday $sonia$ said suddenly in reply in a loud rapid whisper and again she looked down in #confusion#
my #mother# has just said it is like a tomb her lips and chin were trembling once more she had been struck at once by $mr_raskolnikov$ poor surroundings and now these words broke out spontaneously
a silence followed there was a light in $dounia$ eyes and even $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ looked kindly at $sonia$ $rodya$ she said getting up we shall have dinner together of course
and you $rodya$ had better go for a little walk and then rest and lie down before you come to see us
come $dounia$ i am afraid we have exhausted you yes yes i ll come he answered getting up fussily but i have #something# to see to
but surely you will have dinner together cried $mr_razumihin$ looking in surprise at $mr_raskolnikov$ what do you mean
yes yes i am coming of course of course and you stay a minute you do not want him just now do you #mother#
or perhaps i am taking him from you oh no no and will you $dmitri_prokofitch$ do us the favour of dining with us
please do added $dounia$ $mr_razumihin$ bowed positively radiant for one moment they were all strangely embarrassed good bye $rodya$ that is till we meet
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ meant to greet $sonia$ too but it somehow failed to come off and she went in a flutter out of the room
i do not like saying good bye good bye $nastasya$ ah i have said good bye again but $avdotya_romanovna$ seemed to await her turn and following her #mother# out gave $sonia$ an attentive courteous bow
there was a look of poignant discomfort in her face as though $avdotya_romanovna$ courtesy and attention were oppressive and painful to her
$sonia$ in #confusion# gave a hurried frightened curtsy $dounia$ good bye called $mr_raskolnikov$ in the passage give me your #hand#
why i did give it to you have you forgotten said $dounia$ turning warmly and awkwardly to him never mind give it to me again
and he squeezed her fingers warmly $dounia$ smiled flushed pulled her #hand# away and went off quite happy come that capital he said to $sonia$ going back and looking brightly at her
god give peace to the dead the living have still to live that is right isnt it $sonia$ looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face
he looked at her for some moments in silence the whole history of the dead father floated before his memory in those moments
heavens $dounia$ $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ began as soon as they were in the #street# i really feel relieved myself at coming away more at ease
how little did i think yesterday in the train that i could ever be glad of that i tell you again #mother# he is still very ill
dont you see it perhaps worrying about us upset him we must be patient and much much can be forgiven
well you were not very patient $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ caught her up hotly and jealously do you know $dounia$ i was looking at you two
you are the very portrait of him and not so much in face as in soul you are both melancholy both morose and hot tempered both haughty and both generous
surely he cant be an egoist $dounia$ eh when i think of what is in store for us this #evening# my heart sinks
dont be uneasy #mother# what must be will be $dounia$ only think what a position we are in what if $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ breaks it off
poor $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ blurted out incautiously he wont be worth much if he does answered $dounia$ sharply and contemptuously
we did well to come away $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ hurriedly broke in he was in a hurry about some business or other
if he gets out and has a breath of air it is fearfully close in his room but where is one to get a breath of air here
the very #street# here feel like shut up rooms good heavens what a town stay this side they will crush you carrying #something#
why it is a piano they have got i declare how they push i am very much afraid of that young woman too
what young woman #mother# why that $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ who was there just now why i have a presentiment $dounia$
well you may believe it or not but as soon as she came in that very minute i felt that she was the chief cause of the trouble
nothing of the sort cried $dounia$ in vexation what nonsense with your presentiments #mother# he only made her acquaintance the #evening# before and he did not know her when she came in
well you will see she worries me but you will see you will see i was so frightened she was gazing at me with those eyes
i could scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her do you remember it seems so strange but $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ writes like that about her and he introduces her to us to you
so he must think a great deal of her people will write anything we were talked about and written about too
have you forgotten i am sure that she is a good girl and that it is all nonsense god grant it may be
and $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ is a contemptible slanderer $dounia$ snapped out suddenly $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was crushed the conversation was not resumed
i will tell you what i want with you said $mr_raskolnikov$ drawing $mr_razumihin$ to the window then i will tell $katerina_ivanovna$ that you are coming $sonia$ said hurriedly preparing to depart
one minute $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ we have no secrets you are not in our way i want to have another word or two with you
listen he turned suddenly to $mr_razumihin$ again you know that what his name $porfiry_petrovitch$ i should think so
he is a relation why added the latter with interest is not he managing that case you know about that murder
he was inquiring for people who had pawned things and i have some pledges there too trifles a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when i left home and my father silver watch they are only worth five or six #rouble# altogether
you were speaking about it yesterday yes well $mr_razumihin$ eyes opened wide but i value them so what am i to do now
i do not want to lose the things especially the watch i was quaking just now for fear #mother# would ask to look at it when we spoke of $dounia$ watch
it is the only thing of father left us she would be ill if it were lost you know what women are
i know i ought to have given notice at the police station but would it not be better to go straight to $porfiry_petrovitch$
so tell me what to do eh what do you think the matter might be settled more quickly you see #mother# may ask for it before dinner
certainly not to the police station certainly to $porfiry_petrovitch$ $mr_razumihin$ shouted in extraordinary excitement well how glad i am let us go at once
it is a couple of #step# we shall be sure to find him very well let us go and he will be very very glad to make your acquaintance
i have often talked to him of you at different times i was speaking of you yesterday let us go so you knew the old woman
so that it it is all turning out splendidly oh yes $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ $katerina_ivanovna$ $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ corrected $mr_raskolnikov$ $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ this is my #friend# $mr_razumihin$ and he is a good #man#
if you have to go now $sonia$ was beginning not looking at $mr_razumihin$ at all and still more embarrassed
let us go decided $mr_raskolnikov$ i will come to you to #day# $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ only tell me where you live
he was not exactly ill at ease but seemed hurried and avoided her eyes $sonia$ gave her address and flushed as she did so
they all went out together dont you lock up asked $mr_razumihin$ following him on to the stairs never answered $mr_raskolnikov$
i have been meaning to buy a lock for these two years people are happy who have no need of locks he said laughing to $sonia$
they stood still in the gateway do you go to the right $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ how did you find me by the way
he added as though he wanted to say #something# quite different he wanted to look at her soft clear eyes but this was not easy
why you gave your address to $polenka$ yesterday $polenka$ oh yes $polenka$ that is the little girl she is your sister
did i give her the address why had you forgotten no i remember i had heard my father speak of you
only i did not know your name and he did not know it and now i came and as i had learnt your name i asked to #day# where does $mr_raskolnikov$ live
she was extremely glad to escape at last she went away looking down hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible to walk the twenty #step# to the turning on the right and to be at last alone and then moving rapidly along looking at no one noticing nothing to think to remember to meditate on every word every detail
i did not know you had only a room too good bye i will tell $katerina_ivanovna$ never never had she felt anything like this
she remembered suddenly that $mr_raskolnikov$ meant to come to her that #day# perhaps at once only not to #day# please not to #day#
dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was opening before her she kept muttering with a sinking heart as though entreating someone like a frightened #child#
she was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who was watching her and following at her heels
at the moment when $mr_razumihin$ $mr_raskolnikov$ and she stood still at parting on the pavement this gentleman who was just passing started on hearing $sonia$ words and i asked where $mr_raskolnikov$ lived
he turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three especially upon $mr_raskolnikov$ to whom $sonia$ was speaking then looked back and noted the house
all this was done in an instant as he passed and trying not to betray his interest he walked on more slowly as though waiting for #something#
mercy to me to that room he will see oh dear he had accompanied her from the gateway he was waiting for $sonia$ he saw that they were parting and that $sonia$ was going home
home where i ve seen that face somewhere he #thought# i must find out at the turning he crossed over looked round and saw $sonia$ coming the same way noticing nothing
she turned the #corner# he followed her on the other side after about fifty paces he crossed over again overtook her and kept two or three yards behind her
he was a #man# about fifty rather tall and thickly set with broad high shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little
he wore good and fashionable clothes and looked like a gentleman of position he carried a handsome cane which he tapped on the pavement at each #step# his gloves were spotless
his flaxen hair was still abundant and only touched here and there with grey and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair
he had a broad rather pleasant face with high cheek bones and a fresh colour not often seen in petersburg his eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look his lips were crimson
he was a remarkedly well preserved #man# and looked much younger than his years when $sonia$ came out on the canal bank they were the only two persons on the pavement
he observed her dreaminess and preoccupation on reaching the house where she lodged $sonia$ turned in at the gate he followed her seeming rather surprised
in the courtyard she turned to the right #corner# bah muttered the unknown gentleman and mounted the stairs behind her
only then $sonia$ noticed him she reached the third storey turned down the passage and rang at no on the #door# was inscribed in chalk kapernaumov tailor
bah the stranger repeated again wondering at the strange coincidence and he rang next #door# at no the #door# were two or three yards apart
you lodge at kapernaumov he said looking at $sonia$ and laughing he altered a waistcoat for me yesterday i am staying close here at $madame_resslich$
how odd $sonia$ looked at him attentively we are neighbours he went on gaily i only came to town the #day# before yesterday
good bye for the present $sonia$ made no reply the #door# opened and she slipped in she felt for some reason ashamed and uneasy
on the way to $porfiry_petrovitch$ $mr_razumihin$ was obviously excited that capital brother he repeated several times and i am glad
i am glad what are you glad about $mr_raskolnikov$ #thought# to himself i didnt know that you pledged things at the old woman too
and was it long ago i mean was it long since you were there what a simple hearted fool he is
when was it $mr_raskolnikov$ stopped still to recollect two or three #day# before her death it must have been
but i am not going to redeem the things now he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous solicitude about the things
i ve not more than a silver #rouble# left after last night accursed delirium he laid special emphasis on the delirium
yes yes $mr_razumihin$ hastened to agree with what was not clear then that why you were stuck partly you know in your delirium you were continually mentioning some rings or chains
here this #man# will go to the stake for me and i find him delighted at having it cleared up why i spoke of rings in my delirium
yes yes that clear it all clear now hullo how that idea must have got about among them what a hold the idea must have on all of them
shall we find him he asked suddenly oh yes $mr_razumihin$ answered quickly he is a nice fellow you will see brother
rather clumsy that is to say he is a #man# of polished manners but i mean clumsy in a different sense
he is an intelligent fellow very much so indeed but he has his own range of ideas he is incredulous sceptical cynical he likes to impose on people or rather to make fun of them
his is the old circumstantial method but he understands his work thoroughly last year he cleared up a case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue
he is very very anxious to make your acquaintance on what grounds is he so anxious oh it not exactly
so when he heard about you about your being a law student and not able to finish your studies he said what a pity
and so i concluded from everything together not only that yesterday $mr_zametov$ you know $rodya$ i talked some nonsense on the way home to you yesterday when i was drunk
you see since you ve been ill i happen to have mentioned you several times i am afraid brother of your exaggerating it you see
what that they think i am a madman maybe they are right he said with a constrained smile yes yes
that is pooh no but all that i said and there was #something# else too it was all nonsense drunken nonsense
but why are you apologising i am so sick of it all $mr_raskolnikov$ cried with exaggerated irritability it was partly assumed however
i know i know i understand believe me i understand one ashamed to speak of it if you are ashamed then dont speak of it
both were silent $mr_razumihin$ was more than ecstatic and $mr_raskolnikov$ perceived it with repulsion he was alarmed too by what $mr_razumihin$ had just said about $porfiry_petrovitch$
i shall have to pull a long face with him too he #thought# with a beating heart and he turned white and do it naturally too
but the most natural thing would be to do nothing at all carefully do nothing at all no carefully would not be natural again
oh well we shall see how it turns out we shall see directly is it a good thing to go or not
the most important thing does $porfiry_petrovitch$ know that i was at the old hag flat yesterday and asked about the blood
i must find that out instantly as soon as i go in find out from his face otherwise i ll find out if it my ruin
i say brother he said suddenly addressing $mr_razumihin$ with a sly smile i have been noticing all #day# that you seem to be curiously excited
the butterfly flies to the light my heart is beating that what bad in this grey house said $mr_razumihin$ isnt it so
why you sat on your chair in a way you never do sit on the edge somehow and you seemed to be writhing all the time
excited not a bit of it said $mr_razumihin$ stung to the quick yes brother i assure you it noticeable you kept jumping up for nothing
one moment you were angry and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat you even blushed especially when you were invited to dinner you blushed awfully
nothing of the sort nonsense what do you mean but why are you wriggling out of it like a schoolboy
by jove there he blushing again what a pig you are but why are you so shamefaced about it
romeo stay i ll tell of you to #day# ha ha ha i ll make #mother# laugh and someone else too listen listen listen this is serious
what next you fiend $mr_razumihin$ was utterly overwhelmed turning cold with horror what will you tell them come brother foo
what a pig you are you are like a summer rose and if only you knew how it suits you a romeo over six foot high
and how you ve washed to #day# you cleaned your nails i declare eh that #something# unheard of why i do believe you ve got pomatum on your hair
this is what $mr_raskolnikov$ wanted from within they could be heard laughing as they came in still guffawing in the passage
bend down pig $mr_raskolnikov$ laughed as though he could not restrain himself so laughing they entered $porfiry_petrovitch$ flat not a word here or i ll brain you
$mr_razumihin$ whispered furiously seizing $mr_raskolnikov$ by the shoulder chapter $mr_raskolnikov$ was already entering the room he came in looking as though he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again
behind him $mr_razumihin$ strode in gawky and awkward shamefaced and red as a peony with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression
$mr_raskolnikov$ not waiting for an introduction bowed to $porfiry_petrovitch$ who stood in the middle of the room looking inquiringly at them
he held out his #hand# and shook #hand# still apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few words to introduce himself
but he had no sooner succeeded in assuming a serious air and muttering #something# when he suddenly glanced again as though accidentally at $mr_razumihin$ and could no longer control himself his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried to restrain it
the extraordinary ferocity with which $mr_razumihin$ received this spontaneous mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most genuine fun and naturalness
his face and whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified $mr_raskolnikov$ laughter $mr_razumihin$ strengthened this impression as though on purpose
you fiend he roared waving his arm which at once struck a little round table with an empty tea glass on it
fool everything was sent flying and crashing but why break chairs gentlemen you know it a loss to the crown $porfiry_petrovitch$ quoted gaily
$mr_raskolnikov$ was still laughing with his #hand# in $porfiry_petrovitch$ but anxious not to overdo it awaited the right moment to put a natural #end# to it
$mr_razumihin$ completely put to #confusion# by upsetting the table and smashing the glass gazed gloomily at the fragments cursed and turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance seeing nothing
$mr_zametov$ had been sitting in the #corner# but he rose at the visitors entrance and was standing in expectation with a smile on his lips though he looked with surprise and even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at $mr_raskolnikov$ with a certain embarrassment
$porfiry_petrovitch$ laughed and was ready to go on laughing but obviously looked for explanations $mr_zametov$ unexpected presence struck $mr_raskolnikov$ unpleasantly
i ve got to think of that he #thought# excuse me please he began affecting extreme embarrassment $mr_raskolnikov$ not at all very pleasant to see you and how pleasantly you ve come in
why wont he even say good morning $porfiry_petrovitch$ nodded at $mr_razumihin$ upon my honour i dont know why he is in such a rage with me
i only told him as we came along that he was like romeo and proved it and that was all i think
pig ejaculated $mr_razumihin$ without turning round there must have been very grave grounds for it if he is so furious at the word $porfiry_petrovitch$ laughed
damn you all snapped $mr_razumihin$ and suddenly bursting out laughing himself he went up to $porfiry_petrovitch$ with a more cheerful face as though nothing had happened
this is my #friend# $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ $mr_raskolnikov$ in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make your acquaintance and secondly he has a little matter of business with you
oh you sharp lawyer that ll do we are all fools to come to business bah $mr_zametov$ what brought you here
have you met before have you known each other long what does this mean #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$ uneasily $mr_zametov$ seemed taken aback but not very much so
why it was at your rooms we met yesterday he said easily then i have been spared the trouble
all last week he was begging me to introduce him to you $porfiry_petrovitch$ and you have sniffed each other out without me
where is your tobacco $porfiry_petrovitch$ was wearing a dressing gown very clean linen and trodden down slippers he was a #man# of about five and thirty short stout even to corpulence and clean shaven
he wore his hair cut short and had a large round #head# particularly prominent at the back his soft round rather snub nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression
it would have been good natured except for a look in the eyes which shone with a watery mawkish light under almost white blinking eyelashes
the expression of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish figure and gave it #something# far more serious than could be guessed at first sight
as soon as $porfiry_petrovitch$ heard that his visitor had a little matter of business with him he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down himself on the other #end# waiting for him to explain his business with that careful and over serious attention which is at once oppressive and embarrassing especially to a stranger and especially if what you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such exceptional solemnity
but in brief and coherent phrases $mr_raskolnikov$ explained his business clearly and exactly and was so well satisfied with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at $porfiry_petrovitch$
$mr_razumihin$ sitting opposite at the same table listened warmly and impatiently looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive interest
you have to give information to the police $porfiry_petrovitch$ replied with a most businesslike air that having learnt of this incident that is of the murder you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such and such things belong to you and that you #desire# to redeem them or but they will write to you
that just the #point# that at the present moment $mr_raskolnikov$ tried his utmost to feign embarrassment i am not quite in funds and even this trifling sum is beyond me
i only wanted you see for the present to declare that the things are mine and that when i have money
that no matter answered $porfiry_petrovitch$ receiving his explanation of his pecuniary position coldly but you can if you prefer write straight to me to say that having been informed of the matter and claiming such and such as your property you beg
$porfiry_petrovitch$ did not once take his eyes off him fool $mr_raskolnikov$ swore to himself on an ordinary sheet of paper
oh the most ordinary and suddenly $porfiry_petrovitch$ looked with obvious irony at him screwing up his eyes and as it were winking at him
$mr_raskolnikov$ interrupted eagerly again interested in the financial side of the question but perhaps it was $mr_raskolnikov$ fancy for it all lasted but a moment
there was certainly #something# of the sort $mr_raskolnikov$ could have sworn he winked at him goodness knows why he knows flashed through his mind like lightning
forgive my troubling you about such trifles he went on a little disconcerted the things are only worth five #rouble# but i prize them particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me and i must confess that i was alarmed when i heard
that why you were so much struck when i mentioned to $zossimov$ that $porfiry_petrovitch$ was inquiring for everyone who had pledges
$mr_raskolnikov$ could not help glancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes but immediately recollected himself
$mr_razumihin$ put in with obvious #intention# this was really unbearable you seem to be jeering at me brother he said to him with a well feigned irritability
i dare say i do seem to you absurdly anxious about such trash but you mustnt think me selfish or grasping for that and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes
i told you just now that the silver watch though it not worth a cent is the only thing left us of my father
you may laugh at me but my #mother# is here he turned suddenly to $porfiry_petrovitch$ and if she knew he turned again hurriedly to $mr_razumihin$ carefully making his voice tremble that the watch was lost she would be in despair
you know what women are not a bit of it i didnt mean that at all quite the contrary shouted $mr_razumihin$ distressed
was it right was it natural did i overdo it $mr_raskolnikov$ asked himself in a tremor why did i say that about women
oh your #mother# is with you $porfiry_petrovitch$ inquired yes when did she come last night $porfiry_petrovitch$ paused as though reflecting
your things would not in any case be lost he went on calmly and coldly i have been expecting you here for some time
and as though that was a matter of no importance he carefully offered the ash tray to $mr_razumihin$ who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash over the carpet
$mr_raskolnikov$ shuddered but $porfiry_petrovitch$ did not seem to be looking at him and was still concerned with $mr_razumihin$ cigarette what
expecting him why did you know that he had pledges there cried $mr_razumihin$ $porfiry_petrovitch$ addressed himself to $mr_raskolnikov$
your things the ring and the watch were wrapped up together and on the paper your name was legibly written in pencil together with the date on which you left them with her
$mr_raskolnikov$ smiled awkwardly doing his very utmost to look him straight in the face but he failed and suddenly added i say that because i suppose there were a great many pledges that it must be difficult to remember them all
how observant you are but you remember them all so clearly and and stupid feeble he #thought#
but we know all who had pledges and you are the only one who hasnt come forward $porfiry_petrovitch$ answered with hardly perceptible irony
why did i add that i havent been quite well i heard that too i heard indeed that you were in great distress about #something#
you look pale still i am not pale at all no i am quite well $mr_raskolnikov$ snapped out rudely and angrily completely changing his tone
his anger was mounting he could not repress it and in my anger i shall betray myself flashed through his mind again
why are they torturing me not quite well $mr_razumihin$ caught him up what next he was unconscious and delirious all yesterday
would you believe $porfiry_petrovitch$ as soon as our backs were turned he dressed though he could hardly stand and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight delirious all the time
would you believe it extraordinary really delirious you dont say so $porfiry_petrovitch$ shook his #head# in a womanish way nonsense dont you believe it
but you dont believe it anyway $mr_raskolnikov$ let slip in his anger but $porfiry_petrovitch$ did not seem to catch those strange words
but how could you have gone out if you hadnt been delirious $mr_razumihin$ got hot suddenly what did you go out for
what was the object of it and why on the sly were you in your senses when you did it now that all danger is over i can speak plainly
$mr_raskolnikov$ addressed $porfiry_petrovitch$ suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance i ran away from them to take lodgings where they wouldnt find me and took a lot of money with me
i was awfully sick of them yesterday $mr_zametov$ there saw it i say $mr_zametov$ was i sensible or delirious yesterday settle our dispute
he could have strangled $mr_zametov$ at that moment so hateful were his expression and his silence to him in my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully but you were extremely irritable $mr_zametov$ pronounced dryly
and $nikodim_fomitch$ was telling me to #day# put in $porfiry_petrovitch$ that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a #man# who had been run over
and there said $mr_razumihin$ werent you mad then you gave your last penny to the widow for the funeral
if you wanted to help give fifteen or twenty even but keep three #rouble# for yourself at least but he flung away all the twenty five at once
maybe i found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it so that why i was liberal yesterday $mr_zametov$ knows i ve found a treasure
excuse us please for disturbing you for half an hour with such trivialities he said turning to $porfiry_petrovitch$ with trembling lips
we are boring you arent we oh no quite the contrary quite the contrary if only you knew how you interest me
it interesting to look on and listen and i am really glad you have come forward at last but you might give us some tea
my throat dry cried $mr_razumihin$ capital idea perhaps we will all keep you company wouldnt you like #something# more essential before tea
get along with you $porfiry_petrovitch$ went out to order tea $mr_raskolnikov$ #thought# were in a whirl he was in terrible exasperation
the worst of it is they dont disguise it they dont care to stand on ceremony and how if you didnt know me at all did you come to talk to $nikodim_fomitch$ about me
so they dont care to hide that they are tracking me like a pack of dogs they simply spit in my face
he was shaking with rage come strike me openly dont play with me like a cat with a mouse it hardly civil $porfiry_petrovitch$ but perhaps i wont allow it
i shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly faces and you ll see how i despise you
he could hardly breathe and what if it only my fancy what if i am mistaken and through inexperience i get angry and dont keep up my nasty part
perhaps it all unintentional all their phrases are the usual ones but there is #something# about them it all might be said but there is #something#
why did he say bluntly with her why did $mr_zametov$ add that i spoke artfully why do they speak in that tone
yes the tone $mr_razumihin$ is sitting here why does he see nothing that innocent blockhead never does see anything feverish again
did $porfiry_petrovitch$ wink at me just now of course it nonsense what could he wink for are they trying to upset my nerves or are they teasing me
either it ill fancy or they know even $mr_zametov$ is rude is $mr_zametov$ rude $mr_zametov$ has changed his mind i foresaw he would change his mind
he is at home here while it my first visit $porfiry_petrovitch$ does not consider him a visitor sits with his back to him
they re as thick as thieves no doubt over me not a doubt they were talking about me before we came do they know about the flat
if only they make haste when i said that i ran away to take a flat he let it pass i put that in cleverly about a flat it may be of use afterwards
delirious indeed ha ha ha he knows all about last night he didnt know of my #mother# arrival the hag had written the date on in pencil
you are wrong you wont catch me there are no facts it all supposition you produce facts the flat even isnt a fact but delirium
i know what to say to them do they know about the flat i wont go without finding out what did i come for
but my being angry now maybe is a fact fool how irritable i am perhaps that right to play the invalid
he is feeling me he will try to catch me why did i come all this flashed like lightning through his mind
$porfiry_petrovitch$ returned quickly he became suddenly more jovial your party yesterday brother has left my #head# rather and i am out of sorts altogether he began in quite a different tone laughing to $mr_razumihin$
was it interesting i left you yesterday at the most interesting #point# who got the best of it oh no one of course
they got on to everlasting questions floated off into space only fancy $rodya$ what we got on to yesterday whether there is such a thing as crime
i told you that we talked our #head# off what is there strange it an everyday social question $mr_raskolnikov$ answered casually
the question wasnt put quite like that observed $porfiry_petrovitch$ not quite that true $mr_razumihin$ agreed at once getting warm and hurried as usual
listen $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ and tell us your opinion i want to hear it i was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to help me
you know their doctrine crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more and nothing more no other causes admitted
you are wrong there cried $porfiry_petrovitch$ he was noticeably animated and kept laughing as he looked at $mr_razumihin$ which made him more excited than ever
i told them you were coming it began with the socialist doctrine nothing is admitted $mr_razumihin$ interrupted with heat
i am not wrong i ll show you their pamphlets everything with them is the influence of environment and nothing else their favourite phrase
from which it follows that if society is normally organised all crime will cease at once since there will be nothing to protest against and all #man# will become righteous in one instant
they dont recognise that humanity developing by a historical living process will become at last a normal society but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant quicker than any living process
human nature is not taken into account it is excluded it not supposed to exist that why they instinctively dislike history nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it and they explain it all as stupidity
the living soul demands life the soul wont obey the rules of mechanics the soul is an object of suspicion the soul is retrograde
but what they want though it smells of death and can be made of india rubber at least is not alive has no will is servile and wont revolt
and it comes in the #end# to their reducing everything to the building of #wall# and the planning of rooms and passages in a phalanstery
the phalanstery is ready indeed but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery it wants life it hasnt completed its vital process it too soon for the graveyard
that why they so dislike the living process of life they dont want a living soul you cant skip over nature by logic
logic presupposes three possibilities but there are millions cut away a million and reduce it all to the question of comfort
that the easiest solution of the problem it seductively clear and you musnt think about it that the great thing you mustnt think
the whole secret of life in two pages of print now he is off beating the drum catch hold of him do laughed $porfiry_petrovitch$
can you imagine he turned to $mr_raskolnikov$ six people holding forth like that last night in one room with punch as a preliminary
no brother you are wrong environment accounts for a great deal in crime i can assure you of that
oh i know it does but just tell me a #man# of forty violates a #child# of ten was it environment drove him to it
well strictly speaking it did $porfiry_petrovitch$ observed with noteworthy gravity a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the influence of environment
$mr_razumihin$ was almost in a frenzy oh if you like he roared i ll prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the church of ivan
the great being two hundred and fifty feet high and i will prove it clearly exactly progressively and even with a liberal tendency
i undertake to will you bet on it done let hear please how he will prove it he is always humbugging confound him cried $mr_razumihin$ jumping up and gesticulating
what the use of talking to you he does all that on purpose you dont know him $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ he took their side yesterday simply to make fools of them
and the things he said yesterday and they were delighted he can keep it up for a fortnight together last year he persuaded us that he was going into a monastery he stuck to it for two months
not long ago he took it into his #head# to declare he was going to get married that he had everything ready for the wedding
he ordered new clothes indeed we all began to congratulate him there was no bride nothing all pure fantasy ah you are wrong
i got the clothes before it was the new clothes in fact that made me think of taking you in are you such a good dissembler
$mr_raskolnikov$ asked carelessly you wouldnt have supposed it eh wait a bit i shall take you in too ha ha ha no i ll tell you the truth
all these questions about crime environment #child# recall to my mind an article of yours which interested me at the time
on crime or #something# of the sort i forget the title i read it with pleasure two months ago in the periodical review
i certainly did write an article upon a book six months ago when i left the university but i sent it to the weekly review
my article in the periodical review $mr_raskolnikov$ asked in astonishment but it came out in the periodical
that true but when it ceased to exist the weekly review was amalgamated with the periodical and so your article appeared two months ago in the latter
and the weekly review ceased to exist so that why it wasnt printed at the time didnt you know
$mr_raskolnikov$ had not known why you might get some money out of them for the article what a strange person you are
you lead such a solitary life that you know nothing of matters that concern you directly it a fact i assure you
bravo $rodya$ i knew nothing about it either cried $mr_razumihin$ i ll run to #day# to the reading room and ask for the number
two months ago what was the date it doesnt matter though i will find it think of not telling us how did you find out that the article was mine
it only signed with an initial i only learnt it by chance the other #day# through the editor i know him
i was very much interested i analysed if i remember the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime
very very original but it was not that part of your article that interested me so much but an idea at the #end# of the article which i regret to say you merely suggested without working it out clearly
there is if you recollect a suggestion that there are certain persons who can that is not precisely are able to but have a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes and that the law is not for them
yes and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness $mr_raskolnikov$ smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his idea
what what do you mean a right to crime but not because of the influence of environment $mr_razumihin$ inquired with some alarm even
no not exactly because of it answered $porfiry_petrovitch$ in his article all #man# are divided into ordinary and extraordinary
ordinary #man# have to live in submission have no right to transgress the law because dont you see they are ordinary
but extraordinary #man# have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way just because they are extraordinary
that was your idea if i am not mistaken what do you mean that cant be right $mr_razumihin$ muttered in bewilderment
$mr_raskolnikov$ smiled again he saw the #point# at once and knew where they wanted to drive him he decided to take up the challenge
that wasnt quite my contention he began simply and modestly yet i admit that you have stated it almost correctly perhaps if you like perfectly so
the only difference is that i dont contend that extraordinary people are always bound to commit breaches of morals as you call it
it almost gave him pleasure to admit this in fact i doubt whether such an argument could be published
i simply hinted that an extraordinary #man# has the right that is not an official right but an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep certain obstacles and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his idea sometimes perhaps of benefit to the whole of humanity
you say that my article isnt definite i am ready to make it as clear as i can perhaps i am right in thinking you want me to very well
i maintain that if the discoveries of kepler and newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one a dozen a hundred or more #man# newton would have had the right would indeed have been in duty bound to eliminate the dozen or the hundred #man# for the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity
but it does not follow from that that newton had a right to murder people right and left and to steal every #day# in the market
then i remember i maintain in my article that all well legislators and leaders of #man# such as lycurgus solon mahomet $napoleon$ and so on were all without exception criminals from the very fact that making a new law they transgressed the ancient one handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people and they did not stop short at bloodshed either if that bloodshed often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence of ancient law were of use to their cause
in short i maintain that all great #man# or even #man# a little out of the common that is to say capable of giving some new word must from their very nature be criminals more or less of course
otherwise it hard for them to get out of the common rut and to remain in the common rut is what they cant submit to from their very nature again and to my mind they ought not indeed to submit to it
it remarkable in fact that the majority indeed of these benefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible carnage you see that there is nothing particularly new in all that
as for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary i acknowledge that it somewhat arbitrary but i dont insist upon exact numbers
i only believe in my leading idea that #man# are in general divided by a law of nature into two categories inferior ordinary that is so to say material that serves only to reproduce its #kind# and #man# who have the gift or the talent to utter a new word
the same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before there are of course innumerable sub divisions but the distinguishing features of both categories are fairly well marked
the first category generally speaking are #man# conservative in #temperament# and law abiding they live under control and love to be controlled
to my thinking it is their duty to be controlled because that their vocation and there is nothing humiliating in it for them
the crimes of these #man# are of course relative and varied for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake of the better
but if such a one is forced for the sake of his idea to #step# over a corpse or wade through blood he can i maintain find within himself in his conscience a sanction for wading through blood that depends on the idea and its dimensions note that
it only in that sense i speak of their right to crime in my article you remember it began with the legal question
there no need for such anxiety however the masses will scarcely ever admit this right they punish them or hang them more or less and in doing so fulfil quite justly their conservative vocation
the second category all transgress the law they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their capacities but the same masses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them more or less
the first category is always the #man# of the present the second the #man# of the future the first preserve the world and people it the second move the world and lead it to its goal
each class has an equal right to exist in fact all have equal rights with me and vive la guerre éternelle till the new jerusalem of course
i do $mr_raskolnikov$ answered firmly as he said these words and during the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet
then you believe in the new jerusalem do you and and do you believe in god excuse my curiosity
i do repeated $mr_raskolnikov$ raising his eyes to $porfiry_petrovitch$ and do you believe in lazarus rising from the dead i
i do why do you ask all this you believe it literally literally you dont say so i asked from curiosity
excuse me but let us go back to the question they are not always executed some on the contrary triumph in their lifetime
oh yes some attain their #end# in this life and then they begin executing other people if it necessary indeed for the most part they do
your remark is very witty thank you but tell me this how do you distinguish those extraordinary people from the ordinary ones
excuse the natural anxiety of a practical law abiding citizen but couldnt they adopt a special uniform for instance couldnt they wear #something# be branded in some way
for you know if #confusion# arises and a member of one category imagines that he belongs to the other begins to eliminate obstacles as you so happily expressed it then
are there signs at their birth i feel there ought to be more exactitude more external definition oh that very often happens
no reason to but take note that the mistake can only arise in the first category that is among the ordinary people as i perhaps unfortunately called them
in #spite# of their predisposition to obedience very many of them through a playfulness of nature sometimes vouchsafed even to the cow like to imagine themselves advanced people destroyers and to push themselves into the new movement and this quite sincerely
that remark is wittier than the other thank you meanwhile the really new people are very often unobserved by them or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling tendencies
but i dont think there is any considerable danger here and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far
of course they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away with them and to teach them their place but no more in fact even this isnt necessary as they castigate themselves for they are very conscientious some perform this service for one another and others chastise themselves with their own #hand#
they will impose various public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying effect in fact you ve nothing to be uneasy about
it a law of nature well you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score but there another thing worries me
i am ready to bow down to them of course but you must admit it alarming if there are a great many of them eh
tell me please are there many people who have the right to kill others these extraordinary people oh you neednt worry about that either $mr_raskolnikov$ went on in the same tone
people with new ideas people with the faintest capacity for saying #something# new are extremely few in number extraordinarily so in fact
one thing only is clear that the appearance of all these grades and sub divisions of #man# must follow with unfailing regularity some law of nature
that law of course is unknown at present but i am convinced that it exists and one #day# may become known
the vast mass of mankind is mere material and only exists in order by some great effort by some mysterious process by means of some crossing of races and stocks to bring into the world at last perhaps one #man# out of a thousand with a spark of independence
one in ten thousand perhaps i speak roughly approximately is born with some independence and with still greater independence one in a hundred thousand
the #man# of genius is one of millions and the great geniuses the crown of humanity appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions
in fact i have not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place but there certainly is and must be a definite law it cannot be a matter of chance
why are you both joking $mr_razumihin$ cried at last there you sit making fun of one another are you serious $rodya$
$mr_raskolnikov$ raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply and the unconcealed persistent nervous and discourteous sarcasm of $porfiry_petrovitch$ seemed strange to $mr_razumihin$ beside that quiet and mournful face
well brother if you are really serious you are right of course in saying that it not new that it like what we ve read and heard a thousand times already but what is really original in all this and is exclusively your own to my horror is that you sanction bloodshed in the name of conscience and excuse my saying so with such fanaticism
that i take it is the #point# of your article but that sanction of bloodshed by conscience is to my mind more terrible than the official legal sanction of bloodshed
you are quite right it is more terrible $porfiry_petrovitch$ agreed yes you must have exaggerated there is some mistake i shall read it
you cant think that i shall read it all that is not in the article there only a hint of it said $mr_raskolnikov$
yes yes $porfiry_petrovitch$ couldnt sit still your attitude to crime is pretty clear to me now but excuse me for my impertinence
i am really ashamed to be worrying you like this you see you ve removed my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed but there are various practical possibilities that make me uneasy
what if some #man# or youth imagines that he is a lycurgus or mahomet a future one of course and suppose he begins to remove all obstacles
he has some great enterprise before him and needs money for it and tries to get it do you see
$mr_zametov$ gave a sudden guffaw in his #corner# $mr_raskolnikov$ did not even raise his eyes to him i must admit he went on calmly that such cases certainly must arise
the vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that snare young people especially yes you see well then
what then $mr_raskolnikov$ smiled in reply that not my fault so it is and so it always will be he said just now he nodded at $mr_razumihin$ that i sanction bloodshed
society is too well protected by prisons banishment criminal investigators penal servitude there no need to be uneasy you have but to catch the thief
and what if we do catch him then he gets what he deserves you are certainly logical but what of his conscience
why do you care about that simply from humanity if he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake
that will be his punishment as well as the prison but the real geniuses asked $mr_razumihin$ frowning those who have the right to murder
oughtnt they to suffer at all even for the blood they ve shed why the word ought it not a matter of permission or prohibition
he will suffer if he is sorry for his victim pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart
the really great #man# must i think have great sadness on earth he added dreamily not in the tone of the conversation
he raised his eyes looked earnestly at them all smiled and took his cap he was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance and he felt this
everyone got up well you may abuse me be angry with me if you like $porfiry_petrovitch$ began again but i cant resist
allow me one little question i know i am troubling you there is just one little notion i want to express simply that i may not forget it
very good tell me your little notion $mr_raskolnikov$ stood waiting pale and grave before him well you see i really dont know how to express it properly
when you were writing your article surely you couldnt have helped he he fancying yourself just a little an extraordinary #man# uttering a new word in your sense
and if so could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties and hardship or for some service to humanity to overstep obstacles
it a playful psychological idea that so isnt it quite possibly $mr_raskolnikov$ answered contemptuously $mr_razumihin$ made a movement for instance to rob and murder
and again he winked with his left eye and laughed noiselessly just as before if i did i certainly should not tell you $mr_raskolnikov$ answered with defiant and haughty contempt
no i was only interested on account of your article from a literary #point# of view foo how obvious and insolent that is
allow me to observe he answered dryly that i dont consider myself a mahomet or a $napoleon$ nor any personage of that #kind# and not being one of them i cannot tell you how i should act
$mr_raskolnikov$ #thought# with repulsion oh come dont we all think ourselves napoleons now in russia $porfiry_petrovitch$ said with alarming familiarity
#something# peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice perhaps it was one of these future napoleons who did for alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ last week
$mr_zametov$ blurted out from the #corner# $mr_raskolnikov$ did not speak but looked firmly and intently at $porfiry_petrovitch$ $mr_razumihin$ was scowling gloomily
he seemed before this to be noticing #something# he looked angrily around there was a minute of gloomy silence $mr_raskolnikov$ turned to go
are you going already $porfiry_petrovitch$ said amiably holding out his #hand# with excessive politeness very very glad of your acquaintance
as for your request have no uneasiness write just as i told you or better still come to me there yourself in a #day# or two to morrow indeed
as one of the last to be there you might perhaps be able to tell us #something# he added with a most good natured expression
i shall be there at eleven clock for certain we ll arrange it all we ll have a talk you want to cross examine me officially in due form
$mr_raskolnikov$ asked sharply oh why that not necessary for the present you misunderstand me i lose no opportunity you see and
i ve talked with all who had pledges i obtained evidence from some of them and you are the last yes by the way he cried seemingly suddenly delighted i just remember what was i thinking of
of course i know i know very well he turned to $mr_raskolnikov$ that the fellow is innocent but what is one to do
he turned to $mr_razumihin$ you were talking my ears off about that $nikolay$ we had to trouble $dmitri_prokofitch$ too this is the #point# this is all when you went up the stairs it was past seven wasnt it
yes answered $mr_raskolnikov$ with an unpleasant sensation at the very moment he spoke that he need not have said it
then when you went upstairs between seven and eight didnt you see in a flat that stood open on a second storey do you remember
two workmen or at least one of them they were painting there didnt you notice them it very very important for them
no i didnt see them $mr_raskolnikov$ answered slowly as though ransacking his memory while at the same instant he was racking every nerve almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything
painters no i didnt see them and i dont think i noticed a flat like that open but on the fourth storey he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant
i remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ i remember i remember it clearly some porters were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the #wall#
no i dont remember that there were any painters and i dont think that there was a flat open anywhere no there wasnt
why it was on the #day# of the murder the painters were at work and he was there three #day# before
but painters what do you mean $mr_razumihin$ shouted suddenly as though he had reflected and realised what are you asking
foo i have muddled it $porfiry_petrovitch$ slapped himself on the forehead deuce take it this business is turning my brain
it would be such a great thing for us to find out whether #anyone# had seen them between seven and eight at the flat so i fancied you could perhaps have told us #something#
he addressed $mr_raskolnikov$ somewhat apologetically i quite muddled it then you should be more careful $mr_razumihin$ observed grimly the last words were uttered in the passage
$porfiry_petrovitch$ saw them to the #door# with excessive politeness they went out into the #street# gloomy and sullen and for some #step# they did not say a word
$mr_raskolnikov$ drew a deep breath chapter vi i dont believe it i cant believe it repeated $mr_razumihin$ trying in perplexity to refute $mr_raskolnikov$ arguments
$mr_razumihin$ kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion confused and excited by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about it
they were by now approaching bakaleyev lodgings where $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ and $dounia$ had been expecting them a long while dont believe it then answered $mr_raskolnikov$ with a cold careless smile
that is why you weighed their words m certainly i agree $porfiry_petrovitch$ tone was rather strange and still more that wretch $mr_zametov$
you were noticing nothing as usual but i was weighing every word you are suspicious you are right there was #something# about him but why
if they had that brainless idea they would do their utmost to hide it and conceal their cards so as to catch you afterwards
why he has changed his mind since last night quite the contrary but it was all impudent and careless
if they had had facts i mean real facts or at least grounds for suspicion then they would certainly have tried to hide their game in the #hope# of getting more they would have made a search long ago besides
but they have no facts not one it is all mirage all ambiguous simply a floating idea so they try to throw me out by impudence
and perhaps he was irritated at having no facts and blurted it out in his vexation or perhaps he has some plan he seems an intelligent #man#
perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to know they have a psychology of their own brother but it is loathsome explaining it all
stop and it insulting insulting i understand you but since we have spoken openly now and it is an excellent thing that we have at last i am glad
i will own now frankly that i noticed it in them long ago this idea of course the merest hint only an insinuation but why an insinuation even
simply because a poor student unhinged by #poverty# and hypochondria on the eve of a severe delirious illness note that suspicious vain proud who has not seen a soul to speak to for six months in rags and in boots without soles has to face some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence and the unexpected debt thrust under his nose the i u presented by tchebarov the new paint thirty degrees reaumur and a stifling atmosphere a crowd of people the talk about the murder of a person where he had been just before and all that on an empty stomach he might well have a fainting #fit#
how dare they what foundation have they if only you knew how furious i have been think only and that that is what they found it all on
i understand how annoying it is but in your place $rodya$ i would laugh at them or better still spit in their ugly faces and spit a dozen times in all directions
damn them i hit out in all directions neatly too and so i put an #end# to it damn them dont be downhearted
it a shame he really has put it well though $mr_raskolnikov$ #thought# damn them but the cross examination again to morrow he said with bitterness
must i really enter into explanations with them i feel vexed as it is that i condescended to speak to $mr_zametov$ yesterday in the restaurant
i will squeeze it out of him as one of the family he must let me know the ins and outs of it all
damn it i will go myself to $porfiry_petrovitch$ and as for $mr_zametov$ at last he sees through him #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$ stay
cried $mr_razumihin$ seizing him by the shoulder again stay you were wrong i have #thought# it out you are wrong
but if you had done that could you have said you had seen them painting the flat and the workmen
how was that a trap you say that the question about the workmen was a trap on the contrary you would have seen nothing even if you had seen it
if i had done that thing i should certainly have said that i had seen the workmen and the flat $mr_raskolnikov$ answered with reluctance and obvious disgust
who would own it against himself but why speak against yourself because only peasants or the most inexperienced novices deny everything flatly at examinations
if a #man# is ever so little developed and experienced he will certainly try to admit all the external facts that cant be avoided but will seek other explanations of them will introduce some special unexpected turn that will give them another significance and put them in another light
$porfiry_petrovitch$ might well reckon that i should be sure to answer so and say i had seen them to give an air of truth and then make some explanation
but he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been there two #day# before and that therefore you must have been there on the #day# of the murder at eight clock
yes that is what he was reckoning on that i should not have time to reflect and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer and so would forget that the workmen could not have been there two #day# before
and so he would have caught you over a detail but how could you forget it nothing easier
it is in just such stupid things clever people are most easily caught the more cunning a #man# is the less he suspects that he will be caught in a simple thing
the more cunning a #man# is the simpler the trap he must be caught in $porfiry_petrovitch$ is not such a fool as you think
but at the very moment he was struck by the strangeness of his own frankness and the eagerness with which he had made this explanation though he had kept up all the preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion obviously with a motive from necessity
he is a knave then if that is so $mr_raskolnikov$ could not help laughing i am getting a relish for certain aspects
but almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy as though an unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him
he #thought# to himself his uneasiness kept on increasing they had just reached the entrance to bakaleyev go in alone said $mr_raskolnikov$ suddenly
i will be back directly where are you going why we are just here i cant help it
i will come in half an hour tell them say what you like i will come with you you too want to torture me
he stood for some time on the #step# looking gloomily at $mr_raskolnikov$ striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging
at last gritting his teeth and clenching his fist he swore he would squeeze $porfiry_petrovitch$ like a lemon that very #day# and went up the stairs to reassure $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ who was by now alarmed at their long absence
he screamed with such bitter irritation such despair in his eyes that $mr_razumihin$ #hand# dropped when $mr_raskolnikov$ got home his hair was soaked with sweat and he was breathing heavily
then in senseless terror he rushed to the #corner# to that hole under the paper where he had put the things put his #hand# in and for some minutes felt carefully in the hole in every crack and fold of the paper
he went rapidly up the stairs walked into his unlocked room and at once fastened the latch finding nothing he got up and drew a deep breath
as he was reaching the #step# of bakaleyev he suddenly fancied that #something# a chain a stud or even a bit of paper in which they had been wrapped with the old woman handwriting on it might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack and then might suddenly turn up as unexpected conclusive evidence against him
he stood as though lost in #thought# and a strange humiliated half senseless smile strayed on his lips he took his cap at last and went quietly out of the room
his ideas were all tangled he went dreamily through the gateway here he is himself shouted a loud voice he raised his #head#
the porter was standing at the #door# of his little room and was pointing him out to a short #man# who looked like an artisan wearing a long coat and a waistcoat and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman
from his wrinkled flabby face he looked over fifty his little eyes were lost in fat and they looked out grimly sternly and discontentedly
he stooped and his #head# in a greasy cap hung forward what is it $mr_raskolnikov$ asked going up to the porter
the #man# stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him attentively deliberately then he turned slowly and went out of the gate into the #street# without saying a word
what is it cried $mr_raskolnikov$ why he there was asking whether a student lived here mentioned your name and whom you lodged with
the porter too seemed rather puzzled but not much so and after wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room
$mr_raskolnikov$ ran after the stranger and at once caught sight of him walking along the other side of the #street# with the same even deliberate #step# with his eyes fixed on the ground as though in meditation
i saw you coming and pointed you out and he went away it funny he soon overtook him but for some time walked behind him
the #man# noticed him at once looked at him quickly but dropped his eyes again and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word
at last moving on to a level with him he looked at his face you were inquiring for me of the porter
$mr_raskolnikov$ said at last but in a curiously quiet voice the #man# made no answer he didnt even look at him
again they were both silent why do you come and ask for me and say nothing what the meaning of it
$mr_raskolnikov$ voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words clearly the #man# raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at $mr_raskolnikov$
his legs felt suddenly weak a cold shiver ran down his spine and his heart seemed to stand still for a moment then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free
murderer he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice $mr_raskolnikov$ went on walking beside him so they walked for about a hundred paces side by side in silence
the #man# did not look at him what do you mean what is who is a murderer muttered $mr_raskolnikov$ hardly audibly
you are a murderer the #man# answered still more articulately and emphatically with a smile of triumphant hatred and again he looked straight into $mr_raskolnikov$ pale face and stricken eyes
they had just reached the cross roads the #man# turned to the left without looking behind him $mr_raskolnikov$ remained standing gazing after him
$mr_raskolnikov$ could not see clearly but he fancied that he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph
he saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still standing there with slow faltering #step# with shaking knees $mr_raskolnikov$ made his way back to his little #garret# feeling chilled all over
he took off his cap and put it on the table and for ten minutes he stood without moving then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he stretched himself on it
some #thought# or fragments of #thought# some images without order or coherence floated before his mind faces of people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once whom he would never have recalled the belfry of the church at the billiard table in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards the smell of cigars in some underground tobacco shop a tavern room a back #staircase# quite dark all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg shells and the sunday bells floating in from somewhere
so he lay for half an hour he #thought# of nothing the images followed one another whirling like a hurricane some of them he liked and tried to clutch at but they faded and
all the while there was an oppression within him but it was not overwhelming sometimes it was even pleasant the slight shivering still persisted but that too was an almost pleasant sensation
$mr_razumihin$ opened the #door# and stood for some time in the doorway as though hesitating then he stepped softly into the room and went cautiously to the sofa
he heard the hurried footsteps of $mr_razumihin$ he closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep $mr_raskolnikov$ heard $nastasya$ whisper dont disturb him
let him sleep he can have his dinner later quite so answered $mr_razumihin$ both withdrew carefully and closed the #door#
another half hour passed $mr_raskolnikov$ opened his eyes turned on his back again clasping his #hand# behind his #head# who is he
who is that #man# who sprang out of the earth where was he what did he see he has seen it all that clear
where was he then and from where did he see why has he only now sprung out of the earth and how could he see
is it possible hm continued $mr_raskolnikov$ turning cold and shivering and the jewel case $nikolay$ found behind the #door# was that possible
a clue you miss an infinitesimal line and you can build it into a pyramid of evidence a fly flew by and saw it
is it possible he felt with sudden loathing how weak how physically weak he had become i ought to have known it he #thought# with a bitter smile
and how dared i knowing myself knowing how i should be take up an axe and shed blood i ought to have known beforehand
ah but i did know he whispered in despair at times he came to a standstill at some #thought#
the real master to whom all is permitted storms toulon makes a massacre in paris forgets an army in egypt wastes half a million #man# in the moscow expedition and gets off with a jest at vilna
no those #man# are not made so and altars are set up to him after his death and so all is permitted
$napoleon$ the pyramids waterloo and a wretched skinny old woman a pawnbroker with a red trunk under her bed it a nice hash for $porfiry_petrovitch$ to digest
no such people it seems are not of flesh but of bronze one sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh how can they digest it
it too inartistic a $napoleon$ creep under an old woman bed ugh how loathsome at moments he felt he was raving
he sank into a state of feverish excitement the old woman is of no consequence he #thought# hotly and incoherently
the old woman was a mistake perhaps but she is not what matters the old woman was only an illness
i was in a hurry to overstep i didnt kill a human being but a principle i killed the principle but i didnt overstep i stopped on this side
i was only capable of killing and it seems i wasnt even capable of that principle why was that fool $mr_razumihin$ abusing the socialists
they are industrious commercial people the happiness of all is their case no life is only given to me once and i shall never have it again i dont want to wait for the happiness of all
i simply couldnt pass by my #mother# starving keeping my #rouble# in my #pocket# while i waited for the happiness of all
i want to live myself or else better not live at all i am putting my little brick into the happiness of all
and so my heart is at peace ha ha why have you let me slip i only live once i too want
yes i am certainly a louse he went on clutching at the idea gloating over it and playing with it with vindictive pleasure
in the first place because i can reason that i am one and secondly because for a month past i have been troubling benevolent providence calling it to witness that not for my own fleshly lusts did i undertake it but with a grand and noble object ha ha
ech i am an æsthetic louse and nothing more he added suddenly laughing like a madman thirdly because i aimed at carrying it out as justly as possible weighing measuring and calculating
of all the lice i picked out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as i needed for the first #step# no more nor less so the rest would have gone to a monastery according to her will ha ha
and what shows that i am utterly a louse he added grinding his teeth is that i am perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse i killed and i felt beforehand that i should tell myself so after killing her
can anything be compared with the horror of that the vulgarity the abjectness i understand the prophet with his sabre on his steed allah commands and trembling creation must obey
the prophet is right he is right when he sets a battery across the #street# and blows up the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain
it for you to obey trembling creation and not to have #desire# for that not for you i shall never never forgive the old woman
his hair was soaked with sweat his quivering lips were parched his eyes were fixed on the ceiling #mother# sister how i loved them
why do i hate them now yes i hate them i feel a physical hatred for them i cant bear them near me
i went up to my #mother# and kissed her i remember to embrace her and think if she only knew shall i tell her then
that just what i might do she must be the same as i am he added straining himself to think as it were struggling with delirium
ah how i hate the old woman now i feel i should kill her again if she came to life
poor $lizaveta_ivanovna$ why did she come in it strange though why is it i scarcely ever think of her as though i hadnt killed her
$lizaveta_ivanovna$ $sonia$ poor gentle things with gentle eyes dear women why dont they weep why dont they moan they give up everything their eyes are soft and gentle
$sonia$ sonia gentle $sonia$ he lost consciousness it seemed strange to him that he didnt remember how he got into the #street#
the twilight had fallen and the full moon was shining more and more brightly but there was a peculiar breathlessness in the air
there were crowds of people in the #street# workmen and business people were making their way home other people had come out for a walk there was a smell of mortar dust and stagnant water
$mr_raskolnikov$ walked along mournful and anxious he was distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose of having to do #something# in a hurry but what it was he had forgotten
it was late #evening# suddenly he stood still and saw a #man# standing on the other side of the #street# beckoning to him
he crossed over to him but at once the #man# turned and walked away with his #head# hanging as though he had made no sign to him
when he was within ten paces he recognised him and was frightened it was the same #man# with stooping shoulders in the long coat
$mr_raskolnikov$ followed him at a distance his heart was beating they went down a turning the #man# still did not look round
stay did he really beckon $mr_raskolnikov$ wondered but he tried to overtake him does he know i am following him #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$
the #man# went into the gateway of a big house $mr_raskolnikov$ hastened to the gate and looked in to see whether he would look round and sign to him
in the court yard the #man# did turn round and again seemed to beckon him $mr_raskolnikov$ at once followed him into the yard but the #man# was gone
he must have gone up the first #staircase# $mr_raskolnikov$ rushed after him he heard slow measured #step# two flights above the #staircase# seemed strangely familiar
he reached the window on the first floor the moon shone through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light then he reached the second floor
bah this is the flat where the painters were at work but how was it he did not recognise it at once
the #step# of the #man# above had died away so he must have stopped or hidden somewhere he reached the third storey should he go on
there was a stillness that was dreadful but he went on the sound of his own footsteps scared and frightened him
how dark it was the #man# must be hiding in some #corner# here ah the flat was standing wide open he hesitated and went in
it was very dark and empty in the passage as though everything had been removed he crept on tiptoe into the parlour which was flooded with moonlight
everything there was as before the chairs the looking glass the yellow sofa and the pictures in the frames a huge round copper red moon looked in at the windows
he stood and waited waited a long while and the more silent the moonlight the more violently his heart beat till it was painful
it the moon that makes it so still weaving some mystery #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$ and still the same hush suddenly he heard a momentary sharp crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again
at that moment he noticed in the #corner# between the window and the little cupboard #something# like a cloak hanging on the #wall#
a fly flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz why is that cloak here he #thought# it wasnt there before
he cautiously moved the cloak and saw sitting on a chair in the #corner# the old woman bent double so that he couldnt see her face but it was she
he went up to it quietly and felt that there was someone hiding behind it he stood over her
she is afraid he #thought# he stealthily took the axe from the noose and struck her one blow then another on the skull
but strange to say she did not stir as though she were made of wood he was frightened bent down nearer and tried to look at her but she too bent her #head# lower
he bent right down to the ground and peeped up into her face from below he peeped and turned cold with horror the old woman was sitting and laughing shaking with noiseless laughter doing her utmost that he should not hear it
suddenly he fancied that the #door# from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and whispering within
he was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the old woman on the #head# with all his force but at every blow of the axe the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old woman was simply shaking with mirth
he was rushing away but the passage was full of people the #door# of the flats stood open and on the landing on the stairs and everywhere below there were people rows of #head# all looking but huddled together in silence and expectation
#something# gripped his heart his legs were rooted to the spot they would not move he tried to scream and woke up
he drew a deep breath but his dream seemed strangely to persist his #door# was flung open and a #man# whom he had never seen stood in the doorway watching him intently
is it still a dream he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly perceptibly the stranger was standing in the same place still watching him
he stepped cautiously into the room carefully closing the #door# after him went up to the table paused a moment still keeping his eyes on $mr_raskolnikov$ and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa he put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his #hand# on his cane and his chin on his #hand#
$mr_raskolnikov$ had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them again he lay on his back without stirring it was evident that he was prepared to wait indefinitely
as far as $mr_raskolnikov$ could make out from his stolen glances he was a #man# no longer young stout with a full fair almost whitish beard
ten minutes passed it was still light but beginning to get dusk there was complete stillness in the room not a sound came from the stairs
only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane it was unbearable at last $mr_raskolnikov$ suddenly got up and sat on the sofa
come tell me what you want i knew you were not asleep but only pretending the stranger answered oddly laughing calmly
$arkady_ivanovitch_svidrigaïlov$ $mr_svidrigaïlov$ allow me to introduce myself part iv chapter i can this be still a dream
$mr_raskolnikov$ #thought# once more he looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor $mr_svidrigaïlov$ what nonsense it cant be he said at last aloud in bewilderment
in the first place i wanted to make your personal acquaintance as i have already heard a great deal about you that is interesting and flattering secondly i cherish the #hope# that you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the welfare of your sister $avdotya_romanovna$
for without your support she might not let me come near her now for she is prejudiced against me but with your assistance i reckon on
his visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation i ve come to you for two reasons you reckon wrongly interrupted $mr_raskolnikov$
they only arrived yesterday may i ask you $mr_raskolnikov$ made no reply it was yesterday i know i only arrived myself the #day# before
well let me tell you this $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ i dont consider it necessary to justify myself but kindly tell me what was there particularly criminal on my part in all this business speaking without prejudice with common sense
$mr_raskolnikov$ continued to look at him in silence that in my own house i persecuted a defenceless girl and insulted her with my infamous proposals is that it
but you ve only to assume that i too am a #man# et nihil humanum in a word that i am capable of being attracted and falling in love which does not depend on our will
i am anticipating you then everything can be explained in the most natural manner the question is am i a monster or am i myself a victim
in proposing to the object of my passion to elope with me to america or switzerland i may have cherished the deepest respect for her and may have #thought# that i was promoting our mutual happiness
and what if i am a victim reason is the slave of passion you know why probably i was doing more harm to myself than #anyone#
but that not the #point# $mr_raskolnikov$ interrupted with disgust it simply that whether you are right or wrong we dislike you
we dont want to have anything to do with you we show you the #door# go out $mr_svidrigaïlov$ broke into a sudden laugh
but you re but there no getting round you he said laughing in the frankest way i hoped to get round you but you took up the right line at once
but you are trying to get round me still what of it what of it cried $mr_svidrigaïlov$ laughing openly
but still you have interrupted me one way or another i repeat again there would never have been any unpleasantness except for what happened in the garden
but this is what the french call bonne guerre and the most innocent form of deception $marfa_petrovna$ you have got rid of $marfa_petrovna$ too so they say
but as for your question i really dont know what to say though my own conscience is quite at rest on that score
$mr_raskolnikov$ interrupted rudely oh you ve heard that too then you be sure to though dont suppose that i am in any apprehension about it
all was regular and in order the medical inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy dinner and a bottle of wine and indeed it could have proved nothing else
but i ll tell you what i have been thinking to myself of late on my way here in the train especially
didnt i contribute to all that calamity morally in a way by irritation or #something# of the sort but i came to the conclusion that that too was quite out of the question
$mr_raskolnikov$ laughed i wonder you trouble yourself about it but what are you laughing at only consider i struck her just twice with a switch there were no marks even
i am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that but i know for certain too that $marfa_petrovna$ was very likely pleased at my so to say warmth
the #story# of your sister had been wrung out to the last drop for the last three #day# $marfa_petrovna$ had been forced to sit at home she had nothing to show herself with in the town
dont regard me as a cynic please besides she had bored them so with that letter you heard about her reading the letter
and all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven her first act was to order the carriage to be got out
not to speak of the fact that there are cases when women are very very glad to be insulted in #spite# of all their show of indignation
there are instances of it with everyone human beings in general indeed greatly love to be insulted have you noticed that
but it particularly so with women one might even say it their only amusement at one time $mr_raskolnikov$ #thought# of getting up and walking out and so finishing the interview
but some curiosity and even a sort of prudence made him linger for a moment you are fond of fighting
he asked carelessly no not very $mr_svidrigaïlov$ answered calmly and $marfa_petrovna$ and i scarcely ever fought we lived very harmoniously and she was always pleased with me
i only used the whip twice in all our seven years not counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character
the first time two months after our marriage immediately after we arrived in the country and the last time was that of which we are speaking
by the way do you remember $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ how a few years ago in those #day# of beneficent publicity a nobleman i ve forgotten his name was put to shame everywhere in all the papers for having thrashed a german woman in the railway train
it was in those #day# that very year i believe the disgraceful action of the age took place you know
did you suppose i was such a monster such a reactionary such a slave driver ha ha you remember the egyptian nights that public reading you remember
well as for the gentleman who thrashed the german i feel no sympathy with him because after all what need is there for sympathy
but i must say that there are sometimes such provoking germans that i dont believe there is a progressive who could quite answer for himself
no one looked at the subject from that #point# of view then but that the truly humane #point# of view i assure you
the dark eyes you know ah the golden #day# of our youth where are they after saying this $mr_svidrigaïlov$ broke into a sudden laugh again
$mr_raskolnikov$ saw clearly that this was a #man# with a firm purpose in his mind and able to keep it to himself
i expect you ve not talked to #anyone# for some #day# he asked scarcely #anyone# i suppose you are wondering at my being such an adaptable #man#
no i am only wondering at your being too adaptable a #man# because i am not offended at the rudeness of your questions
is that it but why take offence as you asked so i answered he replied with a surprising expression of simplicity
you know there hardly anything i take interest in he went on as it were dreamily especially now i ve nothing to do
you are quite at liberty to imagine though that i am making up to you with a motive particularly as i told you i want to see your sister about #something#
but i ll confess frankly i am very much bored the last three #day# especially so i am delighted to see you
say what you like there #something# wrong with you and now too not this very minute i mean but now generally
dont be angry $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ but you seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself well well i wont i wont dont scowl
i am not such a bear you know as you think $mr_raskolnikov$ looked gloomily at him you are not a bear perhaps at all he said
i fancy indeed that you are a #man# of very good breeding or at least know how on occasion to behave like one
i am not particularly interested in #anyone# opinion $mr_svidrigaïlov$ answered dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness and therefore why not be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our climate and especially if one has a natural propensity that way he added laughing again
but i ve heard you have many #friend# here you are as they say not without connections what can you want with me then unless you ve some special object
that true that i have #friend# here $mr_svidrigaïlov$ admitted not replying to the chief #point# i ve met some already
i ve been lounging about for the last three #day# and i ve seen them or they ve seen me that a matter of course
i am well dressed and reckoned not a poor #man# the emancipation of the serfs hasnt affected me my property consists chiefly of forests and water meadows
the revenue has not fallen off but i am not going to see them i was sick of them long ago
i ve been here three #day# and have called on no one what a town it is how has it come into existence among us tell me that
a town of officials and students of all sorts yes there a great deal i didnt notice when i was here eight years ago kicking up my heels
but as for these clubs dussauts parades or progress indeed maybe well all that can go on without me he went on again without noticing the question
my only #hope# now is in anatomy by jove it is anatomy besides who wants to be a card sharper
why have you been a card sharper then how could i help being there was a regular set of us #man# of the best society eight years ago we had a fine time
and indeed as a rule in our russian society the best manners are found among those who ve been thrashed have you noticed that
and all #man# of breeding you know poets #man# of property i ve deteriorated in the country but i did get into prison for debt through a low greek who came from nezhin
then $marfa_petrovna$ turned up she bargained with him and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces i owed seventy thousand
we were united in lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure you know she was five years older than
and take note that all my life she held a document over me the iou for thirty thousand #rouble# so if i were to elect to be restive about anything i should be trapped at once
i she was very fond of me for seven years i never left the country and she would have done it
women find nothing incompatible in that if it hadnt been for that would you have given her the slip
$marfa_petrovna$ herself invited me to go abroad seeing i was bored but i ve been abroad before and always felt sick there
i dont know what to say it was scarcely the document restrained me i didnt want to go anywhere else for no reason but the sunrise the bay of naples the sea you look at them and it makes you sad
what most revolting is that one is really sad no it better at home here at least one blames others for everything and excuses oneself
i should have gone perhaps on an expedition to the north pole because ai le vin mauvais and hate drinking and there nothing left but wine
but i say i ve been told berg is going up in a great balloon next sunday from the yusupov garden and will take up passengers at a fee
i have tried it is it true why would you go up i no oh no muttered $mr_svidrigaïlov$ really seeming to be deep in #thought#
what does he mean is he in earnest $mr_raskolnikov$ wondered no the document didnt restrain me $mr_svidrigaïlov$ went on meditatively
it was my own doing not leaving the country and nearly a year ago $marfa_petrovna$ gave me back the document on my name #day# and made me a present of a considerable sum of money too
she had a fortune you know you see how i trust you $arkady_ivanovitch_svidrigaïlov$ that was actually her expression you dont believe she used it
but do you know i managed the estate quite decently they know me in the neighbourhood i ordered books too $marfa_petrovna$ at first approved but afterwards she was afraid of my over studying
you seem to be missing $marfa_petrovna$ very much missing her perhaps really perhaps i am and by the way do you believe in ghosts
what ghosts why ordinary ghosts do you believe in them perhaps not pour vous plaire i wouldnt say no exactly
do you see them then $mr_svidrigaïlov$ looked at him rather oddly $marfa_petrovna$ is pleased to visit me he said twisting his mouth into a strange smile
how do you mean she is pleased to visit you she has been three times i saw her first on the very #day# of the funeral an hour after she was buried
the second time was the #day# before yesterday at daybreak on the journey at the station of malaya vishera and the third time was two hours ago in the room where i am staying
it was the #day# before i left to come here i was alone were you awake quite awake i was wide awake every time
she comes speaks to me for a minute and goes out at the #door# always at the #door# i can almost hear her
what made me think that #something# of the sort must be happening to you $mr_raskolnikov$ said suddenly at the same moment he was surprised at having said it
he was much excited what did you think so $mr_svidrigaïlov$ asked in astonishment did you really didnt i say that there was #something# in common between us eh
when i came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut pretending i said to myself at once here the #man#
you never said so $mr_raskolnikov$ cried sharply and with heat didnt i no i #thought# i did what do you mean by the #man#
what are you talking about cried $mr_raskolnikov$ what do i mean i really dont know $mr_svidrigaïlov$ muttered ingenuously as though he too were puzzled
for a minute they were silent they stared in each other faces that all nonsense $mr_raskolnikov$ shouted with vexation
what does she say when she comes to you she would you believe it she talks of the silliest trifles and
#man# is a strange creature it makes me angry the first time she came in i was tired you know the funeral service the funeral ceremony the lunch afterwards
at last i was left alone in my study i lighted a cigar and began to think she came in at the #door#
you ve been so busy to #day# $arkady_ivanovitch_svidrigaïlov$ you have forgotten to wind the dining room clock she said all those seven years i ve wound that clock every week and if i forgot it she would always remind me
i got out at the station at daybreak i been asleep tired out with my eyes half open i was drinking some coffee
i looked up and there was suddenly $marfa_petrovna$ sitting beside me with a pack of cards in her #hand#
the next #day# i set off on my way here shall i tell your fortune for the journey $arkady_ivanovitch_svidrigaïlov$ she was a great #hand# at telling fortunes
i shall never forgive myself for not asking her to i ran away in a fright and besides the bell rang
i was sitting to #day# feeling very heavy after a miserable dinner from a cookshop i was sitting smoking all of a sudden $marfa_petrovna$ again
she came in very smart in a new green silk dress with a long train good #day# $arkady_ivanovitch_svidrigaïlov$ how do you like my dress
aniska was a dressmaker in the country one of our former serf girls who had been trained in moscow a pretty wench
aniska cant make like this she stood turning round before me i looked at the dress and then i looked carefully very carefully at her face
i wonder you trouble to come to me about such trifles $marfa_petrovna$ good gracious you wont let one disturb you about anything
that just like you $arkady_ivanovitch_svidrigaïlov$ it does you very little credit to come looking for a bride when you ve hardly buried your wife
and if you could make a good choice at least but i know it wont be for your happiness or hers you will only be a laughing stock to all good people
to tease her i said i want to get married $marfa_petrovna$ then she went out and her train seemed to rustle
isnt it nonsense eh but perhaps you are telling lies $mr_raskolnikov$ put in i rarely lie answered $mr_svidrigaïlov$ thoughtfully apparently not noticing the rudeness of the question
and in the past have you ever seen ghosts before yes i have seen them but only once in my life six years ago
i had a serf filka just after his burial i called out forgetting filka my pipe he came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were
i sat still and #thought# he is doing it out of revenge because we had a violent quarrel just before his death
how dare you come in with a hole in your elbow i said go away you scamp he turned and went out and never came again
i didnt tell $marfa_petrovna$ at the time i wanted to have a service sung for him but i was ashamed
you should go to a doctor i know i am not well without your telling me though i dont know what wrong
i believe i am five times as strong as you are i didnt ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen but whether you believe that they exist
no i wont believe it $mr_raskolnikov$ cried with positive anger what do people generally say muttered $mr_svidrigaïlov$ as though speaking to himself looking aside and bowing his #head#
i agree that ghosts only appear to the sick but that only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick not that they dont exist
they say you are ill so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy but that not strictly logical
nothing of the sort $mr_raskolnikov$ insisted irritably no you dont think so $mr_svidrigaïlov$ went on looking at him deliberately
but what do you say to this argument help me with it ghosts are as it were shreds and fragments of other worlds the beginning of them
a #man# in health has of course no reason to see them because he is above all a #man# of this earth and is bound for the sake of completeness and order to live only in this life
but as soon as one is ill as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is broken one begins to realise the possibility of another world and the more seriously ill one is the closer becomes one contact with that other world so that as soon as the #man# dies he #step# straight into that world
i #thought# of that long ago if you believe in a future life you could believe in that too i dont believe in a future life said $mr_raskolnikov$
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ sat lost in #thought# and what if there are only spiders there or #something# of that sort he said suddenly
he is a madman #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$ we always imagine eternity as #something# beyond our conception #something# vast vast but why must it be vast
instead of all that what if it one little room like a bath house in the country black and grimy and spiders in every #corner# and that all eternity is
i sometimes fancy it like that can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than that $mr_raskolnikov$ cried with a feeling of anguish
and how can we tell perhaps that is just and do you know it what i would certainly have made it answered $mr_svidrigaïlov$ with a vague smile
juster this horrible answer sent a cold chill through $mr_raskolnikov$ $mr_svidrigaïlov$ raised his #head# looked at him and suddenly began laughing
only think he cried half an hour ago we had never seen each other we regarded each other as enemies there is a matter unsettled between us we ve thrown it aside and away we ve gone into the abstract
kindly allow me $mr_raskolnikov$ went on irritably to ask you to explain why you have honoured me with your visit and and i am in a hurry i have no time to waste
wasnt i right in saying that we were birds of a feather i want to go out by all means by all means
your sister $avdotya_romanovna$ is going to be married to mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning her name
i cant understand how you dare utter her name in my presence if you really are $mr_svidrigaïlov$ why but i ve come here to speak about her how can i avoid mentioning her
i am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ who is a connection of mine through my wife if you have only seen him for half an hour or heard any facts about him
very good speak but make haste he is no match for $avdotya_romanovna$ i believe $avdotya_romanovna$ is sacrificing herself generously and imprudently for the sake of for the sake of her family
i fancied from all i had heard of you that you would be very glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly advantages
now i know you personally i am convinced of it all this is very naïve excuse me i should have said impudent on your part said $mr_raskolnikov$
dont be uneasy $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ if i were working for my own advantage i would not have spoken out so directly
i will confess #something# psychologically curious about that just now defending my love for $avdotya_romanovna$ i said i was myself the victim
well let me tell you that i ve no feeling of love now not the slightest so that i wonder myself indeed for i really did feel #something#
you mean to say that i am seeking my own #end# i am not quite a fool through idleness and depravity $mr_raskolnikov$ put in
i certainly am idle and depraved but your sister has such qualities that even i could not help being impressed by them
i began to be aware of it before but was only perfectly sure of it the #day# before yesterday almost at the moment i arrived in petersburg
i still fancied in moscow though that i was coming to try to get $avdotya_romanovna$ #hand# and to cut out mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
but that all nonsense as i see myself now have you seen that long excuse me for interrupting you kindly be brief and come to the object of your visit
i am in a hurry i want to go out with the greatest pleasure on arriving here and determining on a certain journey i should like to make some necessary preliminary arrangements
i left my #child# with an aunt they are well provided for and they have no need of me personally and a nice father i should make too
i have taken nothing but what $marfa_petrovna$ gave me a year ago that enough for me excuse me i am just coming to the #point#
it not that i detest him so much but it was through him i quarrelled with $marfa_petrovna$ when i learned that she had dished up this marriage
i want now to see $avdotya_romanovna$ through your mediation and if you like in your presence to explain to her that in the first place she will never gain anything but harm from mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
then begging her pardon for all past unpleasantness to make her a present of ten thousand #rouble# and so assist the rupture with mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ a rupture to which i believe she is herself not disinclined if she could see the way to it
before the journey which may come off i want to settle mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ too you are certainly mad cried $mr_raskolnikov$ not so much angered as astonished
i knew you would scream at me but in the first place though i am not rich this ten thousand #rouble# is perfectly free i have absolutely no need for it
how dare you talk like that if $avdotya_romanovna$ does not accept it i shall waste it in some more foolish way
that the first thing secondly my conscience is perfectly easy i make the offer with no ulterior motive you may not believe it but in the #end# $avdotya_romanovna$ and you will know
the #point# is that i did actually cause your sister whom i greatly respect some trouble and unpleasantness and so sincerely regretting it i want not to compensate not to repay her for the unpleasantness but simply to do #something# to her advantage to show that i am not after all privileged to do nothing but harm
if there were a millionth fraction of self interest in my offer i should not have made it so openly and i should not have offered her ten thousand only when five weeks ago i offered her more
besides i may perhaps very soon marry a young lady and that alone ought to prevent suspicion of any design on $avdotya_romanovna$
in conclusion let me say that in marrying mr $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ she is taking money just the same only from another #man#
dont be angry $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ think it over coolly and quietly $mr_svidrigaïlov$ himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying this
i beg you to say no more said $mr_raskolnikov$ in any case this is unpardonable impertinence not in the least
then a #man# may do nothing but harm to his neighbour in this world and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good by trivial conventional formalities
that absurd if i died for instance and left that sum to your sister in my will surely she wouldnt refuse it
very likely she would oh no indeed however if you refuse it so be it though ten thousand #rouble# is a capital thing to have on occasion
in that case $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ i shall be obliged to try and see her myself and worry her by doing so
in any case i beg you to repeat what i have said to $avdotya_romanovna$ no i wont
and if i do tell her will you not try to see her i dont know really what to say
i should like very much to see her once more dont #hope# for it i sorry but you dont know me
perhaps we may become better #friend# you think we may become #friend# and why not $mr_svidrigaïlov$ said smiling he stood up and took his hat
i didnt quite intend to disturb you and i came here without reckoning on it though i was very much struck by your face this morning
where did you see me this morning $mr_raskolnikov$ asked uneasily i saw you by chance i kept fancying there is #something# about you like me
i am not intrusive i used to get on all right with card sharpers and i never bored prince svirbey a great personage who is a distant relation of mine and i could write about raphael madonna in madam prilukov album and i never left $marfa_petrovna$ side for seven years and i used to stay the night at viazemsky house in the hay market in the old #day# and i may go up in a balloon with berg perhaps
but dont be uneasy oh all right are you starting soon on your travels may i ask what travels
why on that journey you spoke of it yourself a journey oh yes i did speak of a journey well that a wide subject
if only you knew what you are asking he added and gave a sudden loud short laugh perhaps i ll get married instead of the journey
they re making a match for me here yes how have you had time for that but i am very anxious to see $avdotya_romanovna$ once
i earnestly beg it well good bye for the present oh yes i have forgotten #something# tell your sister $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ that $marfa_petrovna$ remembered her in her will and left her three thousand #rouble#
that absolutely certain $marfa_petrovna$ arranged it a week before her death and it was done in my presence $avdotya_romanovna$ will be able to receive the money in two or three weeks
are you telling the truth yes tell her well your servant i am staying very near you as he went out $mr_svidrigaïlov$ ran up against $mr_razumihin$ in the doorway
chapter ii it was nearly eight clock the two young #man# hurried to bakaleyev to arrive before $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ why who was that
asked $mr_razumihin$ as soon as they were in the #street# it was $mr_svidrigaïlov$ that landowner in whose house my sister was insulted when she was their governess
through his persecuting her with his attentions she was turned out by his wife $marfa_petrovna$ this $marfa_petrovna$ begged $dounia$ forgiveness afterwards and she just died suddenly
it was of her we were talking this morning i dont know why i afraid of that #man# he came here at once after his wife funeral
he is very strange and is determined on doing #something# we must guard $dounia$ from him that what i wanted to tell you do you hear
guard her what can he do to harm $avdotya_romanovna$ thank you $rodya$ for speaking to me like that we will we will guard her
where does he live i dont know why didnt you ask what a pity i ll find out though did you see him asked $mr_raskolnikov$ after a pause
yes i noticed him i noticed him well you did really see him you saw him clearly $mr_raskolnikov$ insisted
yes i remember him perfectly i should know him in a thousand i have a good memory for faces
they were silent again hm that all right muttered $mr_raskolnikov$ do you know i fancied i keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination
what do you mean i dont understand you well you all say $mr_raskolnikov$ went on twisting his mouth into a smile that i am mad
i #thought# just now that perhaps i really am mad and have only seen a phantom what do you mean
why who can tell perhaps i am really mad and perhaps everything that happened all these #day# may be only imagination
ach $rodya$ you have been upset again but what did he say what did he come for $mr_raskolnikov$ did not answer
$mr_razumihin$ #thought# a minute now let me tell you my #story# he began i came to you you were asleep
then we had dinner and then i went to $porfiry_petrovitch$ $mr_zametov$ was still with him i tried to begin but it was no use
i couldnt speak in the right way they dont seem to understand and cant understand but are not a bit ashamed
i drew $porfiry_petrovitch$ to the window and began talking to him but it was still no use he looked away and i looked away
at last i shook my fist in his ugly face and told him as a cousin i brain him he merely looked at me i cursed and came away
but you see i #thought# i made a mess of it but as i went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me why should we trouble
that was all it was very stupid to $mr_zametov$ i didnt say a word of course if you were in any danger or anything but why need you care
we shall have a laugh at them afterwards and if i were in your place i mystify them more than ever
you neednt care a hang for them how ashamed they ll be afterwards hang them we can thrash them afterwards but let laugh at them now
strange to say till that moment it had never occurred to him to wonder what $mr_razumihin$ would think when he knew
to be sure answered $mr_raskolnikov$ but what will you say to morrow he #thought# to himself as he #thought# it $mr_raskolnikov$ looked at him
$mr_razumihin$ account of his visit to $porfiry_petrovitch$ had very little interest for him so much had come and gone since then
in the corridor they came upon $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ he had arrived punctually at eight and was looking for the number so that all three went in together without greeting or looking at one another
the young #man# walked in first while $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ for good manners lingered a little in the passage taking off his coat
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ came forward at once to greet him in the doorway $dounia$ was welcoming her brother $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ walked in and quite amiably though with redoubled dignity bowed to the ladies
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ who seemed also a little embarrassed hastened to make them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling
he looked however as though he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself $dounia$ and $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ were facing one another on opposite sides of the table
$mr_razumihin$ and $mr_raskolnikov$ were facing $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ $mr_razumihin$ was next to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and $mr_raskolnikov$ was beside his sister a moment silence followed
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ deliberately drew out a cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of a benevolent #man# who felt himself slighted and was firmly resolved to insist on an explanation
in the passage the idea had occurred to him to keep on his overcoat and walk away and so give the two ladies a sharp and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position
besides he could not endure uncertainty and he wanted an explanation if his request had been so openly disobeyed there was #something# behind it and in that case it was better to find it out beforehand
but he could not bring himself to do this it rested with him to punish them and there would always be time for that
i trust you had a favourable journey he inquired officially of $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ oh very $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ i am gratified to hear it
and $avdotya_romanovna$ is not over fatigued either i am young and strong i dont get tired but it was a great strain for #mother# answered $dounia$
that unavoidable our national railways are of terrible length #mother# russia as they say is a vast country in #spite# of all my #desire# to do so i was unable to meet you yesterday
oh no $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ it was all terribly disheartening $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ hastened to declare with peculiar intonation and if $dmitri_prokofitch$ had not been sent us i really believe by god himself we should have been utterly lost
but i trust all passed off without inconvenience here he is $dmitri_prokofitch$ $mr_razumihin$ she added introducing him to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
i had the pleasure yesterday muttered $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ with a hostile glance sidelong at $mr_razumihin$ then he scowled and was silent
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ belonged to that class of persons on the surface very polite in society who make a great #point# of punctiliousness but who directly they are crossed in anything are completely disconcerted and become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively #man# of society
again all was silent $mr_raskolnikov$ was obstinately mute $avdotya_romanovna$ was unwilling to open the conversation too soon $mr_razumihin$ had nothing to say so $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was anxious again
$marfa_petrovna$ is dead have you heard she began having recourse to her leading item of conversation to be sure i heard so
i was immediately informed and i have come to make you acquainted with the fact that $arkady_ivanovitch_svidrigaïlov$ $mr_svidrigaïlov$ set off in haste for petersburg immediately after his wife funeral
so at least i have excellent authority for believing to petersburg here $dounia$ asked in alarm and looked at her #mother#
yes indeed and doubtless not without some design having in view the rapidity of his departure and all the circumstances preceding it
i imagine that neither you nor $avdotya_romanovna$ have any grounds for uneasiness unless of course you are yourselves desirous of getting into communication with him
good heavens wont he leave $dounia$ in peace even here cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ for my part i am on my guard and am now discovering where he is lodging
oh $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ you would not believe what a fright you have given me $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ went on i ve only seen him twice but i #thought# him terrible terrible
i am convinced that he was the cause of $marfa_petrovna$ death it impossible to be certain about that
i do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of events by the moral influence so to say of the affront but as to the general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage i am in agreement with you
i do not know whether he is well off now and precisely what $marfa_petrovna$ left him this will be known to me within a very short period but no doubt here in petersburg if he has any pecuniary resources he will relapse at once into his old ways
i have considerable reason to believe that $marfa_petrovna$ who was so unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years ago was of service to him also in another way
solely by her exertions and sacrifices a criminal charge involving an element of fantastic and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to siberia was hushed up
i have precise information he is the most depraved and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of #man# that the sort of #man# he is if you care to know
good heavens cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ $mr_raskolnikov$ listened attentively are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of this
$dounia$ asked sternly and emphatically i only repeat what i was told in secret by $marfa_petrovna$ i must observe that from the legal #point# of view the case was far from clear
there was and i believe still is living here a woman called $madame_resslich$ a foreigner who lent small sums of money at interest and did other commissions and with this woman $mr_svidrigaïlov$ had for a long while close and mysterious relations
she had a relation a niece i believe living with her a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen or perhaps not more than fourteen
$madame_resslich$ hated this girl and grudged her every crust she used to beat her mercilessly one #day# the girl was found hanging in the #garret#
after the usual proceedings the matter ended but later on information was given that the #child# had been cruelly outraged by $mr_svidrigaïlov$
it is true this was not clearly established the information was given by another german woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted no statement was actually made to the police thanks to $marfa_petrovna$ money and exertions it did not get beyond gossip
you heard no doubt $avdotya_romanovna$ when you were with them the #story# of the servant philip who died of ill treatment he received six years ago before the abolition of serfdom
at the inquest the verdict was suicide and yet the #story# is a very significant one i heard on the contrary that this philip hanged himself
quite so but what drove him or rather perhaps disposed him to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of $mr_svidrigaïlov$
i only heard a queer #story# that philip was a sort of hypochondriac a sort of domestic philosopher the servants used to say he read himself silly and that he hanged himself partly on account of $mr_svidrigaïlov$ mockery of him and not his blows
when i was there he behaved well to the servants and they were actually fond of him though they certainly did blame him for philip death
i perceive $avdotya_romanovna$ that you seem disposed to undertake his defence all of a sudden $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ observed twisting his lips into an ambiguous smile there no doubt that he is an astute #man# and insinuating where ladies are concerned of which $marfa_petrovna$ who has died so strangely is a terrible instance
my only #desire# has been to be of service to you and your #mother# with my advice in view of the renewed efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him
i dont know that answered $dounia$ dryly for my part it my firm conviction that he will #end# in a debtor prison again
$marfa_petrovna$ had not the slightest #intention# of settling anything substantial on him having regard for his #child# interests and if she left him anything it would only be the merest sufficiency #something# insignificant and ephemeral which would not last a year for a #man# of his habits
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ i beg you said $dounia$ say no more of $mr_svidrigaïlov$ it makes me miserable he has just been to see me said $mr_raskolnikov$ breaking his silence for the first time
there were exclamations from all and they all turned to him even $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ was roused an hour and a half ago he came in when i was asleep waked me and introduced himself $mr_raskolnikov$ continued
he was fairly cheerful and at ease and quite #hope# that we shall become #friend# he is particularly anxious by the way $dounia$ for an interview with you at which he asked me to assist
he told me too that a week before her death $marfa_petrovna$ left you three thousand #rouble# in her will $dounia$ and that you can receive the money very shortly
he has a proposition to make to you and he told me about it thank god cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ crossing herself
pray for her soul $dounia$ it a fact broke from $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ tell us what more $dounia$ urged $mr_raskolnikov$
then he said that he wasnt rich and all the estate was left to his #child# who are now with an aunt then that he was staying somewhere not far from me but where i dont know i didnt ask
but what what does he want to propose to $dounia$ cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ in a fright did he tell you
yes what was it i ll tell you afterwards $mr_raskolnikov$ ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ looked at his watch
i am compelled to keep a business engagement and so i shall not be in your way he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up
dont go $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ said $dounia$ you intended to spend the #evening# besides you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an explanation with #mother#
precisely so $avdotya_romanovna$ $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ answered impressively sitting down again but still holding his hat i certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured #mother# upon a very important #point# indeed
but as your brother cannot speak openly in my presence of some proposals of $mr_svidrigaïlov$ i too do not #desire# and am not able to speak openly in the presence of others of certain matters of the greatest gravity
moreover my most weighty and urgent request has been disregarded assuming an aggrieved air $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ relapsed into dignified silence
your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was disregarded solely at my insistance said $dounia$
you wrote that you had been insulted by my brother i think that this must be explained at once and you must be reconciled
and if $rodya$ really has insulted you then he should and will apologise $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ took a stronger line
there is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep and when it has been overstepped there is no return
there are insults $avdotya_romanovna$ which no goodwill can make us forget that wasnt what i was speaking of exactly $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ $dounia$ interrupted with some impatience
please understand that our whole future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as soon as possible
i tell you frankly at the start that i cannot look at it in any other light and if you have the least regard for me all this business must be ended to #day# however hard that may be
i repeat that if my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness i am surprised at your putting the question like that said $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ getting more and more irritated
esteeming and so to say adoring you i may at the same time very well indeed be able to dislike some member of your family
ah dont be so ready to take offence $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ $dounia$ interrupted with feeling and be the sensible and generous #man# i have always considered and wish to consider you to be
though i lay claim to the happiness of your #hand# i cannot accept duties incompatible with i ve given you a great promise i am your betrothed
trust me in this matter and believe me i shall be capable of judging impartially my assuming the part of judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you
when i insisted on his coming to our interview to #day# after your letter i told him nothing of what i meant to do
understand that if you are not reconciled i must choose between you it must be either you or he that is how the question rests on your side and on his
i dont want to be mistaken in my choice and i must not be for your sake i must break off with my brother for my brother sake
i can find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me and i want to know it and of you whether i am dear to you whether you esteem me whether you are the husband for me
$avdotya_romanovna$ $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ declared huffily your words are of too much consequence to me i will say more they are offensive in view of the position i have the honour to occupy in relation to you
to say nothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an impertinent boy you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to me
i must break off with you you say you or he showing thereby of how little consequence i am in your eyes
i set your interest beside all that has hitherto been most precious in my life what has made up the whole of my life and here you are offended at my making too little account of you
$mr_raskolnikov$ smiled sarcastically $mr_razumihin$ fidgeted but $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ did not accept the reproof on the contrary at every word he became more persistent and irritable as though he relished it
i cannot let this pass considering the relationship and the obligations existing between us what cried $dounia$ flushing
love for the future partner of your life for your husband ought to outweigh your love for your brother he pronounced sententiously and in any case i cannot be put on the same level
although i said so emphatically that i would not speak openly in your brother presence nevertheless i intend now to ask your honoured #mother# for a necessary explanation on a #point# of great importance closely affecting my dignity
your son he turned to $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ yesterday in the presence of mr razsudkin or i think that it excuse me
i have forgotten your surname he bowed politely to $mr_razumihin$ insulted me by misrepresenting the idea i expressed to you in a private conversation drinking coffee
that is that marriage with a poor girl who has had #experience# of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal #point# of view than with one who has lived in luxury since it is more profitable for the moral character
your son intentionally exaggerated the significance of my words and made them ridiculous accusing me of malicious #intention# and as far as i could see relied upon your correspondence with him
i shall consider myself happy $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite conclusion and thereby considerately reassure me
kindly let me know in what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ i dont remember faltered $pulcheria_alexandrovna$
i repeated them as i understood them i dont know how $rodya$ repeated them to you perhaps he exaggerated
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ declared with dignity the proof that $dounia$ and i did not take your words in a very bad sense is the fact that we are here
he could not have exaggerated them except at your instigation good #mother# said $dounia$ approvingly then this is my fault again said $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ aggrieved
well $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ you keep blaming $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ but you yourself have just written what was false about him $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ added gaining courage
you wrote $mr_raskolnikov$ said sharply not turning to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ that i gave money yesterday not to the widow of the #man# who was killed as was the fact but to his daughter whom i had never seen till yesterday
you wrote this to make dissension between me and my family and for that object added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you dont know
i dont remember writing anything false all that is mean slander excuse me sir said $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ quivering with fury
i enlarged upon your qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your sister and #mother# inquiries how i found you and what impression you made on me
as for what you ve alluded to in my letter be so good as to #point# out one word of falsehood show
that is that you didnt throw away your money and that there are not worthless persons in that family however unfortunate
to my thinking you with all your virtues are not worth the little finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones
would you go so far then as to let her associate with your #mother# and sister i have done so already if you care to know
i made her sit down to #day# with #mother# and $dounia$ $rodya$ cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ $dounia$ crimsoned $mr_razumihin$ knitted his brows
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ smiled with lofty sarcasm you may see for yourself $avdotya_romanovna$ he said whether it is possible for us to agree
i #hope# now that this question is at an #end# once and for all i will withdraw that i may not hinder the pleasures of family intimacy and the discussion of secrets
but in withdrawing i venture to request that for the future i may be spared similar meetings and so to say compromises
i appeal particularly to you honoured $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ on this subject the more as my letter was addressed to you and to no one else
he got up from his chair and took his hat $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was a little offended you seem to think we are completely under your authority $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
$dounia$ has told you the reason your #desire# was disregarded she had the best #intention# and indeed you write as though you were laying commands upon me
let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show particular delicacy and consideration for us now because we have thrown up everything and have come here relying on you and so we are in any case in a sense in your #hand#
that is not quite true $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ especially at the present moment when the news has come of $marfa_petrovna$ legacy which seems indeed very apropos judging from the new tone you take to me he added sarcastically
are we to consider every #desire# of yours as a command judging from that remark we may certainly presume that you were reckoning on our helplessness $dounia$ observed irritably
but now in any case i cannot reckon on it and i particularly #desire# not to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of $arkady_ivanovitch_svidrigaïlov$ $mr_svidrigaïlov$ which he has entrusted to your brother and which have i perceive a great and possibly a very agreeable interest for you
good heavens cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ $mr_razumihin$ could not sit still on his chair arent you ashamed now sister asked $mr_raskolnikov$
i am ashamed $rodya$ said $dounia$ $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ go away she turned to him white with anger $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion
he had too much confidence in himself in his power and in the helplessness of his victims he could not believe it even now
$avdotya_romanovna$ if i go out of this #door# now after such a dismissal then you may reckon on it i will never come back
he turned pale and his lips quivered consider what you are doing my word is not to be shaken
what insolence cried $dounia$ springing up from her seat i dont want you to come back again what
cried $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ utterly unable to the last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of his reckoning now
so that how it stands so that how it stands but do you know $avdotya_romanovna$ that i might protest
what right have you to speak to her like that $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ intervened hotly and what can you protest about
what rights have you am i to give my $dounia$ to a #man# like you go away leave us altogether we are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action and i above all
but you have bound me $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ stormed in a frenzy by your promise and now you deny it and besides
this last complaint was so characteristic of $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ that $mr_raskolnikov$ pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it could not help breaking into laughter
i have been led on account of that into expenses but $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was furious expenses what expenses are you speaking of our trunk
but the conductor brought it for nothing for you mercy on us we have bound you what are you thinking about $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ it was you bound us #hand# and foot not we
enough #mother# no more please $avdotya_romanovna$ implored $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ do be #kind# and go i am going but one last word he said quite unable to control himself
your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that i made up my mind to take you so to speak after the gossip of the town had spread all over the district in regard to your reputation
disregarding public opinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation i certainly might very well reckon on a fitting return and might indeed look for gratitude on your part
and my eyes have only now been opened i see myself that i may have acted very very recklessly in disregarding the universal verdict
does the fellow want his #head# smashed cried $mr_razumihin$ jumping up you are a mean and spiteful #man# cried $dounia$
not a word not a movement cried $mr_raskolnikov$ holding $mr_razumihin$ back then going close up to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ kindly leave the room
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that worked with anger then he turned went out and rarely has any #man# carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against $mr_raskolnikov$
it is noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case was perhaps not utterly lost and that so far as the ladies were concerned all might very well indeed be set right again
he said quietly and distinctly and not a word more or him and him alone he blamed for everything chapter iii
the fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an ending he had been overbearing to the last degree never dreaming that two destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ who had made his way up from insignificance was morbidly given to self admiration had the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacities and sometimes even gloated in solitude over his image in the glass
but what he loved and valued above all was the money he had amassed by his labour and by all sorts of devices that money made him the equal of all who had been his superiors
when he had bitterly reminded $dounia$ that he had decided to take her in #spite# of evil report $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ had spoken with perfect sincerity and had indeed felt genuinely indignant at such black ingratitude
this conviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit a conceit to the #point# of fatuity and yet when he made $dounia$ his offer he was fully aware of the groundlessness of all the gossip
the #story# had been everywhere contradicted by $marfa_petrovna$ and was by then disbelieved by all the townspeople who were warm in $dounia$ a defence
yet he still #thought# highly of his own resolution in lifting $dounia$ to his level and regarded it as #something# heroic
in speaking of it to $dounia$ he had let out the secret feeling he cherished and admired and he could not understand that others should fail to admire it too
he had called on $mr_raskolnikov$ with the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good deeds and to hear agreeable flattery
and he would not have denied that he knew all that at the time and as he went downstairs now he considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised
$dounia$ was simply essential to him to do without her was unthinkable for many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage but he had gone on waiting and amassing money
he brooded with relish in profound secret over the image of a girl virtuous poor she must be poor very young very pretty of good birth and education very timid one who had suffered much and was completely humbled before him one who would all her life look on him as her saviour worship him admire him and only him
how many scenes how many amorous episodes he had imagined on this seductive and playful theme when his work was over
and behold the dream of so many years was all but realised the beauty and education of $avdotya_romanovna$ had impressed him her helpless position had been a great allurement in her he had found even more than he dreamed of
here was a girl of pride character virtue of education and breeding superior to his own he felt that and this creature would be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension and would humble herself in the dust before him and he would have absolute unbounded power over her
not long before he had too after long reflection and #hesitation# made an important change in his career and was now entering on a wider circle of business
with this change his cherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely to be realised he was in fact determined to try his fortune in petersburg
the fascination of a charming virtuous highly educated woman might make his way easier might do wonders in attracting people to him throwing an aureole round him and now everything was in ruins
he knew that women could do a very great deal this sudden horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder it was like a hideous joke an absurdity
he had only been a tiny bit masterful had not even time to speak out had simply made a joke been carried away and it had ended so seriously
and of course too he did love $dounia$ in his own way he already possessed her in his dreams and all at once
no the next #day# the very next #day# it must all be set right smoothed over settled above all he must crush that conceited milksop who was the cause of it all
with a sick feeling he could not help recalling $mr_razumihin$ too but he soon reassured himself on that score as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him
the #man# he really dreaded in earnest was $mr_svidrigaïlov$ he had in short a great deal to attend to
i was tempted by his money but on my honour brother i had no idea he was such a base #man#
no i i am more to blame than #anyone# said $dounia$ kissing and embracing her #mother# if i had seen through him before nothing would have tempted me
dont blame me brother god has delivered us god has delivered us $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ muttered but half consciously as though scarcely able to realise what had happened
they were all relieved and in five minutes they were laughing only now and then $dounia$ turned white and frowned remembering what had passed
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was surprised to find that she too was glad she had only that morning #thought# rupture with $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ a terrible misfortune
he did not yet dare to express his joy fully but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton weight had fallen off his heart
$mr_razumihin$ was delighted now he had the right to devote his life to them to serve them anything might happen now
but he felt afraid to think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination range but $mr_raskolnikov$ sat still in the same place almost sullen and indifferent
though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened
$dounia$ could not help thinking that he was still angry with her and $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ watched him timidly what did $mr_svidrigaïlov$ say to you said $dounia$ approaching him
he wants to make you a present of ten thousand #rouble# and he #desire# to see you once in my presence
yes yes cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ $mr_raskolnikov$ raised his #head# see her on no account cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ and how dare he offer her money
then $mr_raskolnikov$ repeated rather dryly his conversation with $mr_svidrigaïlov$ omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of $marfa_petrovna$ wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk
what answer did you give him asked $dounia$ at first i said i would not take any message to you
then he said that he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help he assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation now he has no feeling for you
he doesnt want you to marry $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ his talk was altogether rather muddled how do you explain him to yourself $rodya$
how did he strike you i must confess i dont quite understand him he offers you ten thousand and yet says he is not well off
he says he is going away and in ten minutes he forgets he has said it then he says he is going to be married and has already fixed on the girl
no doubt he has a motive and probably a bad one but it odd that he should be so clumsy about it if he had any designs against you
of course i refused this money on your account once for all altogether i #thought# him very strange one might almost think he was mad
but i may be mistaken that may only be the part he assumes the death of $marfa_petrovna$ seems to have made a great impression on him
god rest her soul exclaimed $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ i shall always always pray for her where should we be now $dounia$ without this three thousand
it as though it had fallen from heaven why $rodya$ this morning we had only three #rouble# in our #pocket# and $dounia$
and i were just planning to pawn her watch so as to avoid borrowing from that #man# until he offered help
$dounia$ seemed strangely impressed by $mr_svidrigaïlov$ offer she still stood meditating he has got some terrible plan she said in a half whisper to herself almost shuddering
$mr_raskolnikov$ noticed this disproportionate terror i fancy i shall have to see him more than once again he said to $dounia$
we will watch him i will track him out cried $mr_razumihin$ vigorously i wont lose sight of him
$rodya$ has given me leave he said to me himself just now take care of my sister will you give me leave too $avdotya_romanovna$
$dounia$ smiled and held out her #hand# but the look of anxiety did not leave her face $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ gazed at her timidly but the three thousand #rouble# had obviously a soothing effect on her
a quarter of an hour later they were all engaged in a lively conversation even $mr_raskolnikov$ listened attentively for some time though he did not talk
$mr_razumihin$ was the speaker and why why should you go away he flowed on ecstatically and what are you to do in a little town
the great thing is you are all here together and you need one another you do need one another believe me
for a time anyway take me into partnership and i assure you we ll plan a capital enterprise listen i ll explain it all in detail to you the whole project
i tell you what i have an uncle i must introduce him to you a most accommodating and respectable old #man#
this uncle has got a capital of a thousand #rouble# and he lives on his pension and has no need of that money
for the last two years he has been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent
it all flashed into my #head# this morning before anything had happened interest i know what that means he simply wants to help me
last year i had no need of it but this year i resolved to borrow it as soon as he arrived
then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have enough for a start so we ll go into partnership and what are we going to do
then $mr_razumihin$ began to unfold his project and he explained at length that almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all of what they are selling and for that reason they are usually bad publishers and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give a profit sometimes a considerable one
for the last two years he had been working in publishers offices and knew three european languages well though he had told $mr_raskolnikov$ six #day# before that he was schwach in german with an object of persuading him to take half his translation and half the payment for it
$mr_razumihin$ had indeed been dreaming of setting up as a publisher he had told a lie then and $mr_raskolnikov$ knew he was lying
why why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief means of success money of our own
cried $mr_razumihin$ warmly of course there will be a lot of work but we will work you $avdotya_romanovna$ i $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$
and the great #point# of the business is that we shall know just what wants translating and we shall be translating publishing learning all at once
you get a splendid profit on some books nowadays i can be of use because i have #experience# for nearly two years i ve been scuttling about among the publishers and now i know every detail of their business
why i know and i kept the secret two or three books which one might get a hundred #rouble# simply for thinking of translating and publishing
you need not be a saint to make pots believe me and why why should we let our chance slip indeed and i would not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them
and what do you think if i were to tell a publisher i dare say he hesitate they are such blockheads and as for the business side printing paper selling you trust to me i know my way about
we ll begin in a small way and go on to a large in any case it will get us our living and we shall get back our capital
i know nothing about it of course put in $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ it may be a good idea but again god knows
$dounia$ eyes shone i like what you are saying $dmitri_prokofitch$ she said it new and untried
of course we must remain here at least for a time she looked at $rodya$ what do you think brother said $dounia$
of course it too soon to dream of a publishing firm but we certainly might bring out five or six books and be sure of success
i think he got a very good idea he answered i know of one book myself which would be sure to go well
and as for his being able to manage it there no doubt about that either he knows the business but we can talk it over later
hurrah cried $mr_razumihin$ now stay there a flat here in this house belonging to the same owner it a special flat apart not communicating with these lodgings
it furnished rent moderate three rooms suppose you take them to begin with i ll pawn your watch to morrow and bring you the money and everything can be arranged then
you can all three live together and $rodya$ will be with you but where are you off to $rodya$ what $rodya$ you are going already
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ asked in dismay at such a minute cried $mr_razumihin$ $dounia$ looked at her brother with incredulous wonder he held his cap in his #hand# he was preparing to leave them
one would think you were burying me or saying good bye for ever he said somewhat oddly he attempted to smile but it did not turn out a smile
but who knows perhaps it is the last time we shall see each other he let slip accidentally it was what he was thinking and it somehow was uttered aloud
what is the matter with you cried his #mother# where are you going $rodya$ asked $dounia$ rather strangely
oh i quite obliged to he answered vaguely as though hesitating what he would say but there was a look of sharp determination in his white face
i meant to tell you #mother# and you $dounia$ that it would be better for us to part for a time
i meant to say as i was coming here i feel ill i am not at peace i will come afterwards i will come of myself when it possible
i remember you and love you leave me leave me alone i decided this even before i absolutely resolved on it
whatever may come to me whether i come to ruin or not i want to be alone forget me altogether it better
perhaps it will all come back but now if you love me give me up else i shall begin to hate you i feel it
dont inquire about me when i can i ll come of myself or i ll send for you good bye good god cried $pulcheria_alexandrovna$
both his #mother# and his sister were terribly alarmed $mr_razumihin$ was also $rodya$ rodya be reconciled with us let us be as before cried his poor #mother#
he turned slowly to the #door# and slowly went out of the room $dounia$ overtook him brother what are you doing to #mother#
i coming he muttered in an undertone as though not fully conscious of what he was saying and he went out of the room
she whispered her eyes flashing with indignation he looked dully at her no matter i shall come wicked heartless egoist cried $dounia$
he is insane but not heartless he is mad dont you see it you re heartless after that $mr_razumihin$ whispered in her ear squeezing her #hand# tightly
i shall be back directly he shouted to the horror stricken #mother# and he ran out of the room $mr_raskolnikov$ was waiting for him at the #end# of the passage
i knew you would run after me he said go back to them be with them be with them to morrow and always
i perhaps i shall come if i can good bye and without holding out his #hand# he walked away
but where are you going what are you doing what the matter with you how can you go on like this
$mr_razumihin$ muttered at his wits #end# $mr_raskolnikov$ stopped once more once for all never ask me about anything i have nothing to tell you
dont come to see me maybe i ll come here leave me but dont leave them do you understand me it was dark in the corridor they were standing near the lamp
for a minute they were looking at one another in silence $mr_razumihin$ remembered that minute all his life $mr_raskolnikov$ burning and intent eyes grew more penetrating every moment piercing into his soul into his consciousness
suddenly $mr_razumihin$ started #something# strange as it were passed between them some idea some hint as it were slipped #something# awful hideous and suddenly understood on both sides
$mr_razumihin$ turned pale do you understand now said $mr_raskolnikov$ his face twitching nervously go back go to them he said suddenly and turning quickly he went out of the house
i will not attempt to describe how $mr_razumihin$ went back to the ladies how he soothed them how he protested that $rodya$ needed rest in his illness protested that $rodya$ was sure to come that he would come every #day# that he was very very much upset that he must not be irritated that he $mr_razumihin$ would watch over him would get him a doctor the best doctor a consultation
in fact from that #evening# $mr_razumihin$ took his place with them as a son and a brother chapter iv $mr_raskolnikov$ went straight to the house on the canal bank where $sonia$ lived
it was an old green house of three storeys he found the porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of kapernaumov the tailor
having found in the #corner# of the courtyard the entrance to the dark and narrow #staircase# he mounted to the second floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey over the yard
while he was wandering in the darkness uncertain where to turn for kapernaumov #door# a #door# opened three paces from him he mechanically took hold of it
who is there a woman voice asked uneasily it i come to see you answered $mr_raskolnikov$ and he walked into the tiny entry
on a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick it you good heavens cried $sonia$ weakly and she stood rooted to the spot
a minute later $sonia$ too came in with the candle set down the candlestick and completely disconcerted stood before him inexpressibly agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit
which is your room this way and $mr_raskolnikov$ trying not to look at her hastened in the colour rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes
she felt sick and ashamed and happy too $mr_raskolnikov$ turned away quickly and sat on a chair by the table he scanned the room in a rapid glance
it was a large but exceedingly low pitched room the only one let by the kapernaumovs to whose rooms a closed #door# led in the #wall# on the left
in the opposite side on the right #hand# #wall# was another #door# always kept locked that led to the next flat which formed a separate lodging
a #wall# with three windows looking out on to the canal ran aslant so that one #corner# formed a very acute angle and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light
$sonia$ room looked like a barn it was a very irregular quadrangle and this gave it a grotesque appearance the other #corner# was disproportionately obtuse
there was scarcely any furniture in the big room in the #corner# on the right was a bedstead beside it nearest the #door# a chair
a plain deal table covered by a blue cloth stood against the same #wall# close to the #door# into the other flat
on the opposite #wall# near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers looking as it were lost in a desert
two rush bottom chairs stood by the table that was all there was in the room the yellow scratched and shabby #wall# paper was black in the #corner#
it must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter there was every sign of #poverty# even the bedstead had no curtain
$sonia$ looked in silence at her visitor who was so attentively and unceremoniously scrutinising her room and even began at last to tremble with terror as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter of her destinies
i am late it eleven isnt it he asked still not lifting his eyes yes muttered $sonia$ oh yes it is she added hastily as though in that lay her means of escape
my landlady clock has just struck i heard it myself i ve come to you for the last time $mr_raskolnikov$ went on gloomily although this was the first time
i may perhaps not see you again are you going away i dont know to morrow then you are not coming to $katerina_ivanovna$ to morrow
$sonia$ voice shook i dont know i shall know to morrow morning never mind that i ve come to say one word
he raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was sitting down while she was all the while standing before him
why are you standing sit down he said in a changed voice gentle and friendly she sat down he looked kindly and almost compassionately at her
how thin you are what a #hand# quite transparent like a dead #hand# he took her #hand# $sonia$ smiled faintly
of course you were he added abruptly and the expression of his face and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly
i have always been like that she said even when you lived at home yes he looked round him once more
you rent this room from the kapernaumovs yes they live there through that #door# yes they have another room like this
they are very good people very #kind# answered $sonia$ who still seemed bewildered and all the furniture everything everything is theirs
all in one room yes i should be afraid in your room at night he observed gloomily and they are very #kind# and the #child# too often come to see me
they all stammer dont they yes he stammers and he lame and his wife too it not exactly that she stammers but she cant speak plainly
she is a very #kind# woman and he used to be a house serf and there are seven #child# and it only the eldest one that stammers and the others are simply ill
but they dont stammer but where did you hear about them she added with some surprise your father told me then
and how you went out at six clock and came back at nine and how $katerina_ivanovna$ knelt down by your bed
he told me all about you $sonia$ was confused i fancied i saw him to #day# she whispered hesitatingly
whom father i was walking in the #street# out there at the #corner# about ten clock and he seemed to be walking in front
it looked just like him i wanted to go to $katerina_ivanovna$ you were walking in the #street# yes $sonia$ whispered abruptly again overcome with #confusion# and looking down
$katerina_ivanovna$ used to beat you i dare say oh no what are you saying no $sonia$ looked at him almost with dismay
you love her then love her of course said $sonia$ with plaintive emphasis and she clasped her #hand# in distress
ah you dont if you only knew you see she is quite like a #child# her mind is quite unhinged you see from sorrow
and how clever she used to be how generous how #kind# ah you dont understand you dont understand $sonia$ said this as though in despair wringing her #hand# in excitement and distress
it was clear that she was stirred to the very depths that she was longing to speak to champion to express #something#
her pale cheeks flushed there was a look of anguish in her eyes a sort of insatiable compassion if one may so express it was reflected in every feature of her face
beat me how can you good heavens beat me and if she did beat me what then what of it you know nothing nothing about it
she is so unhappy ah how unhappy and ill she is seeking righteousness she is pure she has such faith that there must be righteousness everywhere
and she expects it and if you were to torture her she wouldnt do wrong she doesnt see that it impossible for people to be righteous
and she is angry at it like a #child# like a #child# she is good and what will happen to you
$sonia$ looked at him inquiringly they are left on your #hand# you see they were all on your #hand# before though
and your father came to you to beg for drink well how will it be now i dont know $sonia$ articulated mournfully
they are in debt for the lodging but the landlady i hear said to #day# that she wanted to get rid of them and
will they stay there i dont know $katerina_ivanovna$ says that she wont stay another minute how is it
she is so bold she relies upon you oh no dont talk like that we are one we live like one
$sonia$ was agitated again and even angry as though a canary or some other little bird were to be angry
and what could she do what what could she do she persisted getting hot and excited and how she cried to #day#
her mind is unhinged havent you noticed it at one minute she is worrying like a #child# that everything should be right to morrow the lunch and all that
then she is wringing her #hand# spitting blood weeping and all at once she will begin knocking her #head# against the #wall# in despair
she builds all her #hope# on you she says that you will help her now and that she will borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to superintend it and we will begin a new splendid life
then she will be comforted again and she kisses and hugs me comforts me and you know she has such faith such faith in her fancies
one cant contradict her and all the #day# long she has been washing cleaning mending she dragged the wash tub into the room with her feeble #hand# and sank on the bed gasping for breath
we went this morning to the shops to buy shoes for $polenka$ and lida for theirs are quite worn out only the money we reckoned wasnt enough not nearly enough
and she picked out such dear little boots for she has taste you dont know and there in the shop she burst out crying before the shopmen because she hadnt enough
ah it was sad to see her well after that i can understand your living like this $mr_raskolnikov$ said with a bitter smile
and arent you sorry for them arent you sorry $sonia$ flew at him again why i know you gave your last penny yourself though you seen nothing of it and if you seen everything
oh dear and how often how often i ve brought her to tears only last week yes i only a week before his death
i was cruel and how often i ve done it ah i ve been wretched at the #thought# of it all #day# $sonia$ wrung her #hand# as she spoke at the pain of remembering it
yes i i i went to see them she went on weeping and father said read me #something# $sonia$ my #head# aches read to me here a book
he had a book he had got from $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ he lives there he always used to get hold of such funny books
you were cruel and i said i cant stay as i didnt want to read and i gone in chiefly to show $katerina_ivanovna$ some collars
$katerina_ivanovna$ liked them very much she put them on and looked at herself in the glass and was delighted with them
make me a present of them $sonia$ she said please do please do she said she wanted them so much
$lizaveta_ivanovna$ the pedlar sold me some collars and cuffs cheap pretty new embroidered ones and when could she wear them they just reminded her of her old happy #day#
she looked at herself in the glass admired herself and she has no clothes at all no things of her own hasnt had all these years
and she never asks #anyone# for anything she is proud she sooner give away everything and these she asked for she liked them so much
and i was sorry to give them what use are they to you $katerina_ivanovna$ i said i spoke like that to her
i ought not to have said that she gave me such a look and she was so grieved so grieved at my refusing her
and it was so sad to see and she was not grieved for the collars but for my refusing i saw that
ah if only i could bring it all back change it take back those words ah if i but it nothing to you
did you know $lizaveta_ivanovna$ the pedlar yes did you know her $sonia$ asked with some surprise $katerina_ivanovna$ is in consumption rapid consumption she will soon die said $mr_raskolnikov$ after a pause without answering her question
oh no no no and $sonia$ unconsciously clutched both his #hand# as though imploring that she should not but it will be better if she does die
no not better not at all better $sonia$ unconsciously repeated in dismay and the #child# what can you do except take them to live with you
oh i dont know cried $sonia$ almost in despair and she put her #hand# to her #head# it was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and he had only roused it again
and what if even now while $katerina_ivanovna$ is alive you get ill and are taken to the hospital what will happen then
he persisted pitilessly how can you that cannot be and $sonia$ face worked with awful terror cannot be
$mr_raskolnikov$ went on with a harsh smile you are not insured against it are you what will happen to them then
they will be in the #street# all of them she will cough and beg and knock her #head# against some #wall# as she did to #day# and the #child# will cry
then she will fall down be taken to the police station and to the hospital she will die and the #child#
oh no god will not let it be broke at last from $sonia$ overburdened bosom she listened looking imploringly at him clasping her #hand# in dumb entreaty as though it all depended upon him
$mr_raskolnikov$ got up and began to walk about the room a minute passed $sonia$ was standing with her #hand# and her #head# hanging in terrible dejection
and cant you save put by for a rainy #day# he asked stopping suddenly before her no whispered $sonia$
of course not have you tried he added almost ironically yes and it didnt come off of course not
no need to ask and again he paced the room another minute passed you dont get money every #day#
$sonia$ was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again no she whispered with a painful effort
it will be the same with $polenka$ no doubt he said suddenly no no it cant be no $sonia$ cried aloud in desperation as though she had been stabbed
god would not allow anything so awful he lets others come to it no no god will protect her god
she repeated beside herself but perhaps there is no god at all $mr_raskolnikov$ answered with a sort of malignance laughed and looked at her
she looked at him with unutterable reproach tried to say #something# but could not speak and broke into bitter bitter sobs hiding her face in her #hand#
$sonia$ face suddenly changed a tremor passed over it you say $katerina_ivanovna$ mind is unhinged your own mind is unhinged he said after a brief silence
five minutes passed he still paced up and down the room in silence not looking at her at last he went up to her his eyes glittered
he put his two #hand# on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful face his eyes were hard feverish and piercing his lips were twitching
all at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the ground kissed her foot $sonia$ drew back from him as from a madman
and certainly he looked like a madman what are you doing to me she muttered turning pale and a sudden anguish clutched at her heart
i did not bow down to you i bowed down to all the suffering of humanity he said wildly and walked away to the window
i said just now to an insolent #man# that he was not worth your little finger and that i did my sister honour making her sit beside you
he stood up at once listen he added turning to her a minute later ach you said that to them
and in her presence cried $sonia$ frightened sit down with me an honour why i dishonourable ah why did you say that
it was not because of your dishonour and your sin i said that of you but because of your great suffering
that true he added almost solemnly and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing
isnt it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so and at the same time you know yourself you ve only to open your eyes that you are not helping #anyone# by it not saving #anyone# from anything
tell me he went on almost in a frenzy how this shame and degradation can exist in you side by side with other opposite holy feelings
but you are a great sinner isnt that fearful it would be better a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and #end# it all
but what would become of them $sonia$ asked faintly gazing at him with eyes of anguish but not seeming surprised at his suggestion
he read it all in her face so she must have had that #thought# already perhaps many times and earnestly she had #thought# out in her despair how to #end# it and so earnestly that now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion
the significance of his reproaches and his peculiar attitude to her shame she had of course not noticed either and that too was clear to him
$mr_raskolnikov$ looked strangely at her she had not even noticed the cruelty of his words but he saw how monstrously the #thought# of her disgraceful shameful position was torturing her and had long tortured her
only then he realised what those poor little orphan #child# and that pitiful half crazy $katerina_ivanovna$ knocking her #head# against the #wall# in her consumption meant for $sonia$
but nevertheless it was clear to him again that with her character and the amount of education she had after all received she could not in any case remain so
he was still confronted by the question how could she have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind since she could not bring herself to jump into the water
of course he knew that $sonia$ position was an exceptional case though unhappily not unique and not infrequent indeed but that very exceptionalness her tinge of education her previous life might one would have #thought# have killed her at the first #step# on that revolting path
what what he #thought# could hitherto have hindered her from putting an #end# to it what held her up surely not depravity
all that infamy had obviously only touched her mechanically not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her heart he saw that
there are three ways before her he #thought# the canal the madhouse or at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns the heart to stone
the last idea was the most revolting but he was a sceptic he was young abstract and therefore cruel and so he could not help believing that the last #end# was the most likely
he saw through her as she stood before him but can that be true he cried to himself
can that creature who has still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last into that sink of filth and iniquity
can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her
can the process already have begun no no that cannot be he cried as $sonia$ had just before
and if she has not gone out of her mind but who says she has not gone out of her mind
no what has kept her from the canal till now is the idea of sin and they the #child# is she in her senses
how can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger
can one talk can one reason as she does does she expect a miracle no doubt she does doesnt that all mean madness
he stayed obstinately at that #thought# he liked that explanation indeed better than any other he began looking more intently at her
so you pray to god a great deal $sonia$ he asked her $sonia$ did not speak he stood beside her waiting for an answer
what should i be without god she whispered rapidly forcibly glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes and squeezing his #hand#
ah so that is it he #thought# and what does god do for you he asked probing her further
$sonia$ was silent a long while as though she could not answer her weak chest kept heaving with emotion be silent
dont ask you dont deserve she cried suddenly looking sternly and wrathfully at him that it that it he repeated to himself
he does everything she whispered quickly looking down again that the way out that the explanation he decided scrutinising her with eager curiosity with a new strange almost morbid feeling
he gazed at that pale thin irregular angular little face those soft blue eyes which could flash with such fire such stern energy that little body still shaking with indignation and anger and it all seemed to him more and more strange almost impossible
she is a religious maniac he repeated to himself there was a book lying on the chest of drawers
he had noticed it every time he paced up and down the room now he took it up and looked at it
it was the new testament in the russian translation it was bound in leather old and worn where did you get that
he called to her across the room she was still standing in the same place three #step# from the table
it was brought me she answered as it were unwillingly not looking at him who brought it $lizaveta_ivanovna$ i asked her for it
$lizaveta_ivanovna$ strange he #thought# everything about $sonia$ seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every moment he carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the pages
where is the #story# of lazarus he asked suddenly $sonia$ looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer
she was standing sideways to the table where is the raising of lazarus find it for me $sonia$ she stole a glance at him
you are not looking in the right place it in the fourth gospel she whispered sternly without looking at him
he sat down with his elbow on the table leaned his #head# on his #hand# and looked away sullenly prepared to listen
find it and read it to me he said in three weeks time they ll welcome me in the madhouse i shall be there if i am not in a worse place he muttered to himself
$sonia$ heard $mr_raskolnikov$ request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly to the table she took the book however havent you read it
she asked looking up at him across the table her voice became sterner and sterner long ago when i was at school
read and havent you heard it in church i havent been do you often go no whispered $sonia$ $mr_raskolnikov$ smiled
i understand and you wont go to your father funeral to morrow yes i shall i was at church last week too
i had a requiem service for whom for $lizaveta_ivanovna$ she was killed with an axe his nerves were more and more strained
his #head# began to go round were you #friend# with $lizaveta_ivanovna$ yes she was good she used to come not often
she couldnt we used to read together and talk she will see god the last phrase sounded strange in his ears
and here was #something# new again the mysterious meetings with $lizaveta_ivanovna$ and both of them religious maniacs i shall be a religious maniac myself soon
it infectious read he cried irritably and insistently $sonia$ still hesitated her heart was throbbing she hardly dared to read to him
he looked almost with exasperation at the unhappy lunatic what for you dont believe she whispered softly and as it were breathlessly
read i want you to he persisted you used to read to $lizaveta_ivanovna$ $sonia$ opened the book and found the place
her #hand# were shaking her voice failed her twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the first syllable
now a certain #man# was sick named lazarus of bethany she forced herself at last to read but at the third word her voice broke like an overstrained string
$mr_raskolnikov$ saw in part why $sonia$ could not bring herself to read to him and the more he saw this the more roughly and irritably he insisted on her doing so
he understood only too well how painful it was for her to betray and unveil all that was her own
he understood that these feelings really were her secret treasure which she had kept perhaps for years perhaps from childhood while she lived with an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief in the midst of starving #child# and unseemly abuse and reproaches
but at the same time he knew now and knew for certain that although it filled her with dread and suffering yet she had a tormenting #desire# to read and to read to him that he might hear it and to read now whatever might come of it
there was a catch in her breath he read this in her eyes he could see it in her intense emotion
she mastered herself controlled the spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chapter of st john she went on to the nineteenth verse
then martha as soon as she heard that $jesus$ was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house
and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother then said martha unto $jesus$ lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died
but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would quiver and break again
$jesus$ said unto her thy brother shall rise again martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last #day#
$jesus$ said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live
she saith unto him and drawing a painful breath $sonia$ read distinctly and forcibly as though she were making a public confession of faith
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god
which should come into the world she stopped and looked up quickly at him but controlling herself went on reading
$mr_raskolnikov$ sat without moving his elbows on the table and his eyes turned away she read to the thirty second verse
then when mary was come where $jesus$ was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died
when $jesus$ therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have ye laid him
they said unto him lord come and see $jesus$ wept then said the jews behold how he loved him
and some of them said could not this #man# which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this #man# should not have died
$mr_raskolnikov$ turned and looked at her with emotion yes he had known it she was trembling in a real physical fever
he had expected it she was getting near the #story# of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense triumph came over her
her voice rang out like a bell triumph and joy gave it power the lines danced before her eyes but she knew what she was reading by heart
at the last verse could not this #man# which opened the eyes of the blind dropping her voice she passionately reproduced the doubt the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving jews who in another moment would fall at his feet as though struck by thunder sobbing and believing
and he he too is blinded and unbelieving he too will hear he too will believe yes yes at once now was what she was dreaming and she was quivering with happy anticipation
$jesus$ therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it
martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead four #day#
$jesus$ saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god
$jesus$ said take ye away the stone she laid emphasis on the word four then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid
and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me
and $jesus$ lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth
and he that was dead came forth she read loudly cold and trembling with ecstasy as though she were seeing it before her eyes
bound #hand# and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin $jesus$ saith unto them loose him and let him go
then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the things which $jesus$ did believed on him
she could read no more closed the book and got up from her chair quickly that is all about the raising of lazarus she whispered severely and abruptly and turning away
the candle #end# was flickering out in the battered candlestick dimly lighting up in the #poverty# stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely been reading together the eternal book
she stood motionless not daring to raise her eyes to him she still trembled feverishly five minutes or more passed
i came to speak of #something# $mr_raskolnikov$ said aloud frowning he got up and went to $sonia$ she lifted her eyes to him in silence
his face was particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in it i have abandoned my family to #day# he said my #mother# and sister
i am not going to see them i ve broken with them completely what for asked $sonia$ amazed her recent meeting with his #mother# and sister had left a great impression which she could not analyse
she heard his news almost with horror i have only you now he added let us go together i ve come to you we are both accursed let us go our way together
his eyes glittered as though he were mad $sonia$ #thought# in her turn go where she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back
how do i know i only know it the same road i know that and nothing more it the same goal
she looked at him and understood nothing she knew only that he was terribly infinitely unhappy no one of them will understand if you tell them but i have understood
i need you that is why i have come to you i dont understand whispered $sonia$ you ll understand later havent you done the same
you too have transgressed have had the strength to transgress you have laid #hand# on yourself you have destroyed a life your own it all the same
but you wont be able to stand it and if you remain alone you ll go out of your mind like me
you might have lived in spirit and understanding but you ll #end# in the hay market you are like a mad creature already
so we must go together on the same road let us go what for what all this for said $sonia$ strangely and violently agitated by his words
you must look things straight in the face at last and not weep like a #child# and cry that god wont allow it
what for because you cant remain like this that why what will happen if you should really be taken to the hospital to morrow
she is mad and in consumption she ll soon die and the #child# do you mean to tell me $polenka$ wont come to grief
havent you seen #child# here at the #street# #corner# sent out by their #mother# to beg i ve found out where those #mother# live and in what surroundings
#child# cant remain #child# there at seven the #child# is vicious and a thief yet #child# you know are the image of christ theirs is the kingdom of heaven
he bade us honour and love them they are the humanity of the future what to be done what to be done
repeated $sonia$ weeping hysterically and wringing her #hand# what to be done break what must be broken once for all that all and take the suffering on oneself
what you dont understand you ll understand later freedom and power and above all power over all trembling creation and all the ant heap
that the goal remember that that my farewell message perhaps it the last time i shall speak to you if i dont come to morrow you ll hear of it all and then remember these words
and some #day# later on in years to come you ll understand perhaps what they meant if i come to morrow i ll tell you who killed $lizaveta_ivanovna$
good bye $sonia$ started with terror why do you know who killed her she asked chilled with horror looking wildly at him
i know and will tell you only you i have chosen you out i not coming to you to ask forgiveness but simply to tell you
i chose you out long ago to hear this when your father talked of you and when $lizaveta_ivanovna$ was alive i #thought# of it
good bye dont shake #hand# to morrow he went out $sonia$ gazed at him as at a madman but she herself was like one insane and felt it
her #head# was going round good heavens how does he know who killed $lizaveta_ivanovna$ what did those words mean it awful
but at the same time the idea did not enter her #head# not for a moment oh he must be terribly unhappy
he has abandoned his #mother# and sister what for what has happened and what had he in his mind what did he say to her
he had kissed her foot and said said yes he had said it clearly that he could not live without her
she jumped up from time to time wept and wrung her #hand# then sank again into feverish sleep and dreamt of $polenka$ $katerina_ivanovna$ and $lizaveta_ivanovna$ of reading the gospel and him
oh merciful heavens $sonia$ spent the whole night feverish and delirious him with pale face with burning eyes kissing her feet weeping
on the other side of the #door# on the right which divided $sonia$ room from $madame_resslich$ flat was a room which had long stood empty
a card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the canal advertising it to let
$sonia$ had long been accustomed to the room being uninhabited but all that time $mr_svidrigaïlov$ had been standing listening at the #door# of the empty room
when $mr_raskolnikov$ went out he stood still #thought# a moment went on tiptoe to his own room which adjoined the empty one brought a chair and noiselessly carried it to the #door# that led to $sonia$ room
the conversation had struck him as interesting and remarkable and he had greatly enjoyed it so much so that he brought a chair that he might not in the future to morrow for instance have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour but might listen in comfort
when next morning at eleven clock punctually $mr_raskolnikov$ went into the department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in to $porfiry_petrovitch$ he was surprised at being kept waiting so long it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned
but he stood in the waiting room and people who apparently had nothing to do with him were continually passing to and fro before him
in the next room which looked like an office several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had no notion who or what $mr_raskolnikov$ might be
he looked uneasily and suspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard some mysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape
but there was nothing of the sort he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty details then other people no one seemed to have any concern with him
the conviction grew stronger in him that if that enigmatic #man# of yesterday that phantom sprung out of the earth had seen everything they would not have let him stand and wait like that
chapter he had expected that they would pounce upon him he might go where he liked for them and would they have waited till he elected to appear at eleven
either the #man# had not yet given information or or simply he knew nothing had seen nothing and how could he have seen anything
and so all that had happened to him the #day# before was again a phantom exaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination
thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh conflict he was suddenly aware that he was trembling and he felt a rush of indignation at the #thought# that he was trembling with fear at facing that hateful $porfiry_petrovitch$
what he dreaded above all was meeting that #man# again he hated him with an intense unmitigated hatred and was afraid his hatred might betray him
his indignation was such that he ceased trembling at once he made ready to go in with a cold and arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained nerves
this conjecture had begun to grow strong the #day# before in the midst of all his alarm and despair at that moment he was summoned to $porfiry_petrovitch$
his study was a room neither large nor small furnished with a large writing table that stood before a sofa upholstered in checked material a bureau a bookcase in the #corner# and several chairs all government furniture of polished yellow wood
he found $porfiry_petrovitch$ alone in his study in the further #wall# there was a closed #door# beyond it there were no doubt other rooms
on $mr_raskolnikov$ entrance $porfiry_petrovitch$ had at once closed the #door# by which he had come in and they remained alone
he met his visitor with an apparently genial and good tempered air and it was only after a few minutes that $mr_raskolnikov$ saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him as though he had been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in #something# very secret
come sit down old #man# or perhaps you dont like to be called my dear fellow and old #man# tout court
ah my dear fellow here you are in our domain began $porfiry_petrovitch$ holding out both #hand# to him please dont think it too familiar
here on the sofa $mr_raskolnikov$ sat down keeping his eyes fixed on him in our domain the apologies for familiarity the french phrase tout court were all characteristic signs
he held out both #hand# to me but he did not give me one he drew it back in time struck him suspiciously
both were watching each other but when their eyes met quick as lightning they looked away i brought you this paper about the watch
yes yes dont be uneasy it all right $porfiry_petrovitch$ said as though in haste and after he had said it he took the paper and looked at it
here it is is it all right or shall i copy it again what a paper yes it all right
a minute later when he was talking of #something# else he took it from the table and put it on his bureau
nothing more is needed he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table i believe you said yesterday you would like to question me formally about my acquaintance with the murdered woman
$mr_raskolnikov$ was beginning again why did i put in i believe passed through his mind in a flash
and he suddenly felt that his uneasiness at the mere contact with $porfiry_petrovitch$ at the first words at the first looks had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions and that this was fearfully dangerous
why am i so uneasy at having put in that i believe came in a second flash his nerves were quivering his emotion was increasing
there no hurry there no hurry muttered $porfiry_petrovitch$ moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim as it were making dashes towards the window the bureau and the table at one moment avoiding $mr_raskolnikov$ suspicious glance then again standing still and looking him straight in the face
his fat round little figure looked very strange like a ball rolling from one side to the other and rebounding back
it bad it bad i shall say too much again yes yes yes we ve plenty of time
do you smoke have you your own here a cigarette he went on offering his visitor a cigarette you know i am receiving you here but my own quarters are through there you know my government quarters
but i am living outside for the time i had to have some repairs done here it almost finished now government quarters you know are a capital thing
eh what do you think yes a capital thing answered $mr_raskolnikov$ looking at him almost ironically a capital thing a capital thing repeated $porfiry_petrovitch$ as though he had just #thought# of #something# quite different
yes a capital thing he almost shouted at last suddenly staring at $mr_raskolnikov$ and stopping short two #step# from him
this stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the serious brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor
tell me please he asked suddenly looking almost insolently at him and taking a #kind# of pleasure in his own insolence
but this stirred $mr_raskolnikov$ spleen more than ever and he could not resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge
i believe it a sort of legal rule a sort of legal tradition for all investigating lawyers to begin their attack from afar with a trivial or at least an irrelevant subject so as to encourage or rather to divert the #man# they are cross examining to disarm his caution and then all at once to give him an unexpected knock down blow with some fatal question
isnt that so it a sacred tradition mentioned i fancy in all the manuals of the art yes yes why do you imagine that was why i spoke about government quarters eh
and as he said this $porfiry_petrovitch$ screwed up his eyes and winked a good humoured crafty look passed over his face
the wrinkles on his forehead were smoothed out his eyes contracted his features broadened and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh shaking all over and looking $mr_raskolnikov$ straight in the face
the latter forced himself to laugh too but when $porfiry_petrovitch$ seeing that he was laughing broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson $mr_raskolnikov$ repulsion overcame all precaution he left off laughing scowled and stared with hatred at $porfiry_petrovitch$ keeping his eyes fixed on him while his intentionally prolonged laughter lasted
there was lack of precaution on both sides however for $porfiry_petrovitch$ seemed to be laughing in his visitor face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with which the visitor received it
the latter fact was very significant in $mr_raskolnikov$ eyes he saw that $porfiry_petrovitch$ had not been embarrassed just before either but that he $mr_raskolnikov$ had perhaps fallen into a trap that there must be #something# some motive here unknown to him that perhaps everything was in readiness and in another moment would break upon him
$porfiry_petrovitch$ he began resolutely though with considerable irritation yesterday you expressed a #desire# that i should come to you for some inquiries he laid special stress on the word inquiries
he went straight to the #point# at once rose from his seat and took his cap i have come and if you have anything to ask me ask it and if not allow me to withdraw
i have to be at the funeral of that #man# who was run over of whom you know also he added feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at his anger
i have no time to spare i am sick of it all do you hear and have long been it partly what made me ill
in short he shouted feeling that the phrase about his illness was still more out of place in short kindly examine me or let me go at once
i will not allow you to do so otherwise and so meanwhile good bye as we have evidently nothing to keep us now
and if you must examine me do so in the proper form good heavens what do you mean what shall i question you about cackled $porfiry_petrovitch$ with a change of tone instantly leaving off laughing
please dont disturb yourself he began fidgeting from place to place and fussily making $mr_raskolnikov$ sit down there no hurry there no hurry it all nonsense
oh no i very glad you ve come to see me at last i look upon you simply as a visitor and as for my confounded laughter please excuse it $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$
it my nerves you tickled me so with your witty observation i assure you sometimes i shake with laughter like an india rubber ball for half an hour at a time
$rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ that is your name i often afraid of an attack of paralysis do sit down please do or i shall think you are angry
$mr_raskolnikov$ did not speak he listened watching him still frowning angrily he did sit down but still held his cap
i must tell you one thing about myself my dear $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ $porfiry_petrovitch$ continued moving about the room and again avoiding his visitor eyes
you see i a bachelor a #man# of no consequence and not used to society besides i have nothing before me i set i running to seed and and have you noticed $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ that in our petersburg circles if two clever #man# meet who are not intimate but respect each other like you and me it takes them half an hour before they can find a subject for conversation they are dumb they sit opposite each other and feel awkward
people in high society always have their subjects of conversation est de rigueur but people of the middle sort like us thinking people that is are always tongue tied and awkward
whether it is the lack of public interest or whether it is we are so honest we dont want to deceive one another i dont know
everyone has subjects of conversation ladies for instance what is the reason of it what do you think do put down your cap it looks as if you were just going it makes me uncomfortable
$mr_raskolnikov$ put down his cap and continued listening in silence with a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of $porfiry_petrovitch$
i am so delighted does he really want to distract my attention with his silly babble i cant offer you coffee here but why not spend five minutes with a #friend#
$porfiry_petrovitch$ pattered on and you know all these official duties please dont mind my running up and down excuse it my dear fellow i am very much afraid of offending you but exercise is absolutely indispensable for me
i always intend to join a gymnasium they say that officials of all ranks even privy councillors may be seen skipping gaily there there you have it modern science
i always sitting and so glad to be moving about for five minutes i suffer from my sedentary life yes yes
but as for my duties here inquiries and all such formalities you mentioned inquiries yourself just now i assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for the interrogator than for the interrogated
you made the observation yourself just now very aptly and wittily $mr_raskolnikov$ had made no observation of the #kind#
one gets into a muddle a regular muddle one keeps harping on the same note like a drum there is to be a reform
and we shall be called by a different name at least he he he and as for our legal tradition as you so wittily called it i thoroughly agree with you
every prisoner on trial even the rudest peasant knows that they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions as you so happily put it and then deal him a knock down blow he he he your felicitous comparison he he
so you really imagined that i meant by government quarters he he you are an ironical person come i wont go on
ah by the way yes one word leads to another you spoke of formality just now apropos of the inquiry you know
but what the use of formality in many cases it nonsense sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets a good deal more out of it
one can always fall back on formality allow me to assure you and after all what does it amount to an examining lawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every #step#
the work of investigation is so to speak a free art in its own way he he he $porfiry_petrovitch$ took breath a moment
he was almost running about the room moving his fat little legs quicker and quicker looking at the ground with his right #hand# behind his back while with his left making gesticulations that were extraordinarily incongruous with his words
$mr_raskolnikov$ suddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop for a moment near the #door# as though he were listening
he had simply babbled on uttering empty phrases letting slip a few enigmatic words and again reverting to incoherence is he expecting anything
you are certainly quite right about it $porfiry_petrovitch$ began gaily looking with extraordinary simplicity at $mr_raskolnikov$ which startled him and instantly put him on his guard certainly quite right in laughing so wittily at our legal forms he he
some of these elaborate psychological methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless if one adheres too closely to the forms yes
well if i recognise or more strictly speaking if i suspect someone or other to be a criminal in any case entrusted to me you re reading for the law of course $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$
well then it is a precedent for you for the future though dont suppose i should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish about crime
no i simply make bold to state it by way of fact if i took this #man# or that for a criminal why i ask should i worry him prematurely even though i had evidence against him
in one case i may be bound for instance to arrest a #man# at once but another may be in quite a different position you know so why shouldnt i let him walk about the town a bit
i am talking of forms again yes i was he he he but i see you dont quite understand so i ll give you a clearer example
if i put him in prison too soon i may very likely give him so to speak moral support he he you re laughing
$mr_raskolnikov$ had no idea of laughing he was sitting with compressed lips his feverish eyes fixed on $porfiry_petrovitch$
yet that is the case with some types especially for #man# are so different you say evidence well there may be evidence
but evidence you know can generally be taken two ways i am an examining lawyer and a weak #man# i confess it
i should like to make a chain of evidence such as twice two are four it ought to be a direct irrefutable proof
and if i shut him up too soon even though i might be convinced he was the #man# i should very likely be depriving myself of the means of getting further evidence against him
by giving him so to speak a definite position i shall put him out of suspense and set his mind at rest so that he will retreat into his shell
they say that at sevastopol soon after alma the clever people were in a terrible fright that the enemy would attack openly and take sevastopol at once
but when they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege they were delighted i am told and reassured for the thing would drag on for two months at least
i should like to make a proof so to say mathematically clear and how you re laughing you dont believe me again
but you must observe this my dear $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ the general case the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended for which they are calculated and laid down in books does not exist at all for the reason that every case every crime for instance so soon as it actually occurs at once becomes a thoroughly special case and sometimes a case unlike any that gone before
of course you re right too you re right you re right these are special cases i admit very comic cases of that sort sometimes occur
if i leave one #man# quite alone if i dont touch him and dont worry him but let him know or at least suspect every moment that i know all about it and am watching him #day# and night and if he is in continual suspicion and terror he ll be bound to lose his #head#
it may be so with a simple peasant but with one of our sort an intelligent #man# cultivated on a certain side it a dead certainty
he ll come of himself or maybe do #something# which will make it as plain as twice two are four it delightful for my dear fellow it a very important matter to know on what side a #man# is cultivated
and then there are nerves there are nerves you have overlooked them why they are all sick nervous and irritable and then how they all suffer from spleen
that i assure you is a regular gold mine for us and it no anxiety to me his running about the town free
let him let him walk about for a bit i know well enough that i ve caught him and that he wont escape me
where could he escape to he he abroad perhaps a pole will escape abroad but not here especially as i am watching and have taken measures
will he escape into the depths of the country perhaps but you know peasants live there real rude russian peasants a modern cultivated #man# would prefer prison to living with such strangers as our peasants
he he but that all nonsense and on the surface it not merely that he has nowhere to run to he is psychologically unable to escape me he he
what an expression through a law of nature he cant escape me if he had anywhere to go have you seen a butterfly round a candle
that how he will keep circling and circling round me freedom will lose its attractions he ll begin to brood he ll weave a tangle round himself he ll worry himself to death
what more he will provide me with a mathematical proof if i only give him long enough interval and he ll keep circling round me getting nearer and nearer and then flop
he ll fly straight into my mouth and i ll swallow him and that will be very amusing he he he you dont believe me
$mr_raskolnikov$ made no reply he sat pale and motionless still gazing with the same intensity into $porfiry_petrovitch$ face it a lesson he #thought# turning cold
this is beyond the cat playing with a mouse like yesterday he cant be showing off his power with no motive prompting me he is far too clever for that
he must have another object what is it it all nonsense my #friend# you are pretending to scare me you ve no proofs and the #man# i saw had no real existence
you simply want to make me lose my #head# to work me up beforehand and so to crush me but you are wrong you wont do it
no my #friend# you are wrong you wont do it even though you have some trap for me let us see what you have in store for me
but why give me such a hint is he reckoning on my shattered nerves and he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal
at times he longed to fall on $porfiry_petrovitch$ and strangle him this anger was what he dreaded from the beginning he felt that his parched lips were flecked with foam his heart was throbbing
he realised that this was the best policy in his position because instead of saying too much he would be irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too freely
no i see you dont believe me you think i am playing a harmless joke on you $porfiry_petrovitch$ began again getting more and more lively chuckling at every instant and again pacing round the room
but he was still determined not to speak till the right moment anyhow this was what he hoped for
and to be sure you re right god has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in other people a buffoon but let me tell you and i repeat it excuse an old #man# my dear $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$
you are a #man# still young so to say in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything like all young people
playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and that for all the world like the old austrian hof kriegsrath as far as i can judge of military matters that is on paper they beaten $napoleon$ and taken him prisoner and there in their study they worked it all out in the cleverest fashion but look you general mack surrendered with all his army
he he he i see i see $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ you are laughing at a civilian like me taking examples out of military history
but i cant help it it my weakness i am fond of military science and i ever so fond of reading all military histories
i ve certainly missed my proper career i ought to have been in the army upon my word i ought i shouldnt have been a $napoleon$ but i might have been a major he he
well i ll tell you the whole truth my dear fellow about this special case i mean actual fact and a #man# #temperament# my dear sir are weighty matters
i listen to an old #man# am speaking seriously $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ as he said this $porfiry_petrovitch$ who was scarcely five and thirty actually seemed to have grown old even his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together
and it astonishing how they sometimes deceive the sharpest calculation moreover i a candid #man# am i a candid #man# or not
what do you say i fancy i really am i tell you these things for nothing and dont even expect a reward for it he he
well to proceed wit in my opinion is a splendid thing it is so to say an adornment of nature and a consolation of life and what tricks it can play
so that it sometimes is hard for a poor examining lawyer to know where he is especially when he liable to be carried away by his own fancy too for you know he is a #man# after all
but young people carried away by their own wit dont think of that when they overstep all obstacles as you wittily and cleverly expressed it yesterday
he will lie that is the #man# who is a special case the incognito and he will lie well in the cleverest fashion you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit but at the most interesting the most flagrant moment he will faint
but the poor fellow is saved by the criminal #temperament# worse luck for him of course there may be illness and a stuffy room as well
but anyway anyway he given us the idea he lied incomparably but he didnt reckon on his #temperament# that what betrays him
another time he will be carried away by his playful wit into making fun of the #man# who suspects him he will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead but his paleness will be too natural too much like the real thing again he has given us an idea
though his questioner may be deceived at first he will think differently next #day# if he is not a fool and of course it is like that at every #step#
he puts himself forward where he is not wanted speaks continually when he ought to keep silent brings in all sorts of allegorical allusions he he
comes and asks why didnt you take me long ago he he he and that can happen you know with the cleverest #man# the psychologist the literary #man#
the #temperament# reflects everything like a mirror gaze into it and admire what you see but why are you so pale $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$
is the room stuffy shall i open the window oh dont trouble please cried $mr_raskolnikov$ and he suddenly broke into a laugh
please dont trouble $porfiry_petrovitch$ stood facing him paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed $mr_raskolnikov$ got up from the sofa abruptly checking his hysterical laughter
$porfiry_petrovitch$ he began speaking loudly and distinctly though his legs trembled and he could scarcely stand i see clearly at last that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister $lizaveta_ivanovna$
let me tell you for my part that i am sick of this if you find that you have a right to prosecute me legally to arrest me then prosecute me arrest me
but i will not let myself be jeered at to my face and worried his lips trembled his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrain his voice
i wont allow it he shouted bringing his fist down on the table do you hear that $porfiry_petrovitch$
i wont allow it good heavens what does it mean cried $porfiry_petrovitch$ apparently quite frightened $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ my dear fellow what is the matter with you
i wont allow it $mr_raskolnikov$ shouted again hush my dear #man# they ll hear and come in just think what could we say to them
$porfiry_petrovitch$ whispered in horror bringing his face close to $mr_raskolnikov$ i wont allow it i wont allow it $mr_raskolnikov$ repeated mechanically but he too spoke in a sudden whisper
$porfiry_petrovitch$ turned quickly and ran to open the window some fresh air and you must have some water my dear fellow
and he was running to the #door# to call for some when he found a decanter of water in the #corner#
you re ill come drink a little he whispered rushing up to him with the decanter it will be sure to do you good
$porfiry_petrovitch$ alarm and sympathy were so natural that $mr_raskolnikov$ was silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity
he did not take the water however $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ my dear fellow you ll drive yourself out of your mind i assure you ach ach
have some water do drink a little he forced him to take the glass $mr_raskolnikov$ raised it mechanically to his lips but set it on the table again with disgust
you ll bring back your illness again my dear fellow $porfiry_petrovitch$ cackled with friendly sympathy though he still looked rather disconcerted
yes you ve had a little attack good heavens you must take more care of yourself $dmitri_prokofitch$ was here came to see me yesterday
i know i know i ve a nasty ironical #temper# but what they made of it good heavens he came yesterday after you been
we dined and he talked and talked away and i could only throw up my #hand# in despair did he come from you
but do sit down for mercy sake sit down no not from me but i knew he went to you and why he went $mr_raskolnikov$ answered sharply
you knew i knew what of it why this $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ that i know more than that about you i know about everything
i know how you went to take a flat at night when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood so that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it
yes i understand your state of mind at that time but you ll drive yourself mad like that upon my word you ll lose your #head#
you re full of generous indignation at the wrongs you ve received first from destiny and then from the police officers and so you rush from one thing to another to force them to speak out and make an #end# of it all because you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness
only in that way you ll lose your #head# and $mr_razumihin$ too he too good a #man# for such a position you must know that
that so isnt it i have guessed how you feel havent i you are ill and he is good and your illness is infectious for him
i ll tell you about it when you are more yourself but do sit down for goodness sake please rest you look shocking do sit down
in amazement he listened with strained attention to $porfiry_petrovitch$ who still seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude
$mr_raskolnikov$ sat down he no longer shivered he was hot all over but he did not believe a word he said though he felt a strange inclination to believe
$porfiry_petrovitch$ unexpected words about the flat had utterly overwhelmed him how can it be he knows about the flat then he #thought# suddenly and he tells it me himself
yes in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar a case of morbid psychology $porfiry_petrovitch$ went on quickly
a #man# confessed to murder and how he kept it up it was a regular hallucination he brought forward facts he imposed upon everyone and why
he had been partly but only partly unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that he had given the murderers the opportunity he sank into dejection it got on his mind and turned his brain he began imagining things and he persuaded himself that he was the murderer
but at last the high court of appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under proper care
why my dear fellow you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse to work upon your nerves to go ringing bells at night and asking about blood
thanks to the court of appeal tut tut tut i ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice a #man# is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry
just the same with bell ringing it all illness $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ you have begun to neglect your illness you should consult an experienced doctor what the good of that fat fellow
you are lightheaded you were delirious when you did all this for a moment $mr_raskolnikov$ felt everything going round is it possible is it possible flashed through his mind that he is still lying
he rejected that idea feeling to what a degree of fury it might drive him feeling that that fury might drive him mad
he cant be he cant be i was not delirious i knew what i was doing he cried straining every faculty to penetrate $porfiry_petrovitch$ game
i was quite myself do you hear yes i hear and understand you said yesterday you were not delirious you were particularly emphatic about it
if you were actually a criminal or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession of your faculties
i understand all you can tell me a ach listen $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ my dear fellow and so emphatically and persistently would it be possible
quite impossible to my thinking if you had anything on your conscience you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious
that so isnt it there was a note of slyness in this inquiry $mr_raskolnikov$ drew back on the sofa as $porfiry_petrovitch$ bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at him
another thing about $mr_razumihin$ you certainly ought to have said that he came of his own accord to have concealed your part in it
but you dont conceal it you lay stress on his coming at your instigation $mr_raskolnikov$ had not done so
you keep telling lies he said slowly and weakly twisting his lips into a sickly smile you are trying again to show that you know all my game that you know all i shall say beforehand he said conscious himself that he was not weighing his words as he ought
a chill went down his back you want to frighten me or you are simply laughing at me
he still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of intense hatred in his eyes
you know perfectly well that the best policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible to conceal as little as possible
you keep lying he said i dont believe you what a wily person you are $porfiry_petrovitch$ tittered there no catching you you ve a perfect monomania
but still you do believe me you believe a quarter i ll soon make you believe the whole because i have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you good
so you dont believe me $mr_raskolnikov$ lips trembled yes i do went on $porfiry_petrovitch$ touching $mr_raskolnikov$ arm genially you must take care of your illness
besides your #mother# and sister are here now you must think of them you must soothe and comfort them and you do nothing but frighten them
what has that to do with you how do you know it what concern is it of yours you are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it
good heavens why i learnt it all from you yourself you dont notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything
no you interrupted me but i must tell you that for all your wit your suspiciousness makes you lose the common sense view of things
i an examining lawyer have betrayed a precious thing like that a real fact for it is a fact worth having and you see nothing in it
from $mr_razumihin$ too i learnt a number of interesting details yesterday to return to bell ringing for instance why if i had the slightest suspicion of you should i have acted like that
no i should first have disarmed your suspicions and not let you see i knew of that fact should have diverted your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock down blow your expression saying and what were you doing sir pray at ten or nearly eleven at the murdered woman flat
and why did you ring the bell and why did you ask about blood and why did you invite the porters to go with you to the police station to the lieutenant
that how i ought to have acted if i had a grain of suspicion of you i ought to have taken your evidence in due form searched your lodging and perhaps have arrested you too
so i have no suspicion of you since i have not done that but you cant look at it normally and you see nothing i say again
$mr_raskolnikov$ started so that $porfiry_petrovitch$ could not fail to perceive it you are lying all the while he cried i dont know your object but you are lying
$porfiry_petrovitch$ repeated apparently incensed but preserving a good humoured and ironical face as though he were not in the least concerned at $mr_raskolnikov$ opinion of him
you did not speak like that just now and i cannot be mistaken i am lying i am lying
prompting you and giving you every means for your defence illness i said delirium injury melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it
though indeed all those psychological means of defence are not very reliable and cut both ways illness delirium i dont remember that all right but why my good sir in your illness and in your delirium were you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others
but how did i treat you just now i the examining lawyer ah he he he there may have been others eh he he he
briefly he said loudly and imperiously rising to his feet and in so doing pushing $porfiry_petrovitch$ back a little briefly i want to know do you acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not
$mr_raskolnikov$ looked haughtily and contemptuously at him tell me $porfiry_petrovitch$ tell me once for all and make haste
what a business i having with you cried $porfiry_petrovitch$ with a perfectly good humoured sly and composed face and why do you want to know
why do you want to know so much since they havent begun to worry you why you are like a #child# asking for matches
and why are you so uneasy why do you force yourself upon us eh he he he i repeat $mr_raskolnikov$ cried furiously that i cant put up with it
with what uncertainty interrupted $porfiry_petrovitch$ dont jeer at me i wont have it i tell you i wont have it
i cant and i wont do you hear do you hear he shouted bringing his fist down on the table again
i am not joking $porfiry_petrovitch$ whispered but this time there was not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face
hush hush they ll overhear i warn you seriously take care of yourself now he was peremptory stern frowning and for once laying aside all mystification
$mr_raskolnikov$ bewildered suddenly fell into actual frenzy but strange to say he again obeyed the command to speak quietly though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury
i will not allow myself to be tortured he whispered instantly recognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and driven to even greater fury by the #thought#
but this was only for an instant arrest me search me but kindly act in due form and dont play with me
dont dare dont worry about the form $porfiry_petrovitch$ interrupted with the same sly smile as it were gloating with enjoyment over $mr_raskolnikov$
i invited you to see me quite in a friendly way i dont want your friendship and i spit on it
do you hear and here i take my cap and go what will you say now if you mean to arrest me
he took up his cap and went to the #door# and wont you see my little surprise chuckled $porfiry_petrovitch$ again taking him by the arm and stopping him at the #door#
he seemed to become more playful and good humoured which maddened $mr_raskolnikov$ what surprise he asked standing still and looking at $porfiry_petrovitch$ in alarm
my little surprise it sitting there behind the #door# he he he he pointed to the locked #door# i locked him in that he should not escape
what is it where what $mr_raskolnikov$ walked to the #door# and would have opened it but it was locked
it locked here is the key and he brought a key out of his #pocket# you are lying roared $mr_raskolnikov$ without restraint you lie you damned punchinello
and he rushed at $porfiry_petrovitch$ who retreated to the other #door# not at all alarmed i understand it all you are lying and mocking so that i may betray myself to you
why you could not betray yourself any further my dear $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ you are in a passion dont shout i shall call the clerks
you are lying call the clerks you knew i was ill and tried to work me into a frenzy to make me betray myself
that was your object produce your facts i understand it all you ve no evidence you have only wretched rubbishly suspicions like $mr_zametov$
you knew my character you wanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and deputies
are you waiting for them eh what are you waiting for where are they produce them why deputies my good #man#
what things people will imagine and to do so would not be acting in form as you say you dont know the business my dear fellow
and there no escaping form as you see $porfiry_petrovitch$ muttered listening at the #door# through which a noise could be heard
ah they re coming cried $mr_raskolnikov$ you ve sent for them you expected them well produce them all your deputies your witnesses what you like
but at this moment a strange incident occurred #something# so unexpected that neither $mr_raskolnikov$ nor $porfiry_petrovitch$ could have looked for such a conclusion to their interview
i am ready chapter vi when he remembered the scene afterwards this is how $mr_raskolnikov$ saw it the noise behind the #door# increased and suddenly the #door# was opened a little
for an instant there was no answer but it was evident that there were several persons at the #door# and that they were apparently pushing somebody back
what is it cried $porfiry_petrovitch$ annoyed why i gave orders what is it $porfiry_petrovitch$ repeated uneasily
the prisoner $nikolay$ has been brought someone answered he is not wanted take him away let him wait what he doing here
two seconds not more were spent in actual struggle then someone gave a violent shove and then a #man# very pale strode into the room
how irregular cried $porfiry_petrovitch$ rushing to the #door# but he began the same voice and suddenly ceased this #man# appearance was at first sight very strange
there was a determined gleam in his eyes at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his face as though he were being led to the scaffold
he was dressed like a workman and was of medium height very young slim his hair cut in round crop with thin spare features
the #man# whom he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him by the shoulder he was a warder but $nikolay$ pulled his arm away
he stared straight before him as though seeing nothing his white lips were faintly twitching several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway
some of them tried to get in all this took place almost instantaneously go away it too soon wait till you are sent for
why have you brought him so soon $porfiry_petrovitch$ muttered extremely annoyed and as it were thrown out of his reckoning
but $nikolay$ suddenly knelt down what the matter cried $porfiry_petrovitch$ surprised i am guilty mine is the sin i am the murderer $nikolay$ articulated suddenly rather breathless but speaking fairly loudly
for ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb even the warder stepped back mechanically retreated to the #door# and stood immovable
what is it cried $porfiry_petrovitch$ recovering from his momentary stupefaction i am the murderer repeated $nikolay$ after a brief pause
what you what whom did you kill $porfiry_petrovitch$ was obviously bewildered $nikolay$ again was silent for a moment
alyona $katerina_ivanovna$ and her sister $lizaveta_ivanovna$ $katerina_ivanovna$ i killed with an axe darkness came over me he added suddenly and was again silent
he still remained on his knees $porfiry_petrovitch$ stood for some moments as though meditating but suddenly roused himself and waved back the uninvited spectators
then he looked towards $mr_raskolnikov$ who was standing in the #corner# staring wildly at $nikolay$ and moved towards him but stopped short looked from $nikolay$ to $mr_raskolnikov$ and then again at $nikolay$ and seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter
they instantly vanished and closed the #door# you re in too great a hurry he shouted at him almost angrily
i didnt ask you what came over you speak did you kill them i am the murderer i want to give evidence $nikolay$ pronounced
ach what did you kill them with an axe i had it ready ach he is in a hurry
alone $nikolay$ did not understand the question did you do it alone yes alone and mitka is not guilty and had no share in it
dont be in a hurry about mitka a ach how was it you ran downstairs like that at the time the porters met you both
it was to put them off the scent i ran after mitka $nikolay$ replied hurriedly as though he had prepared the answer
it not his own tale he is telling he muttered as though to himself and suddenly his eyes rested on $mr_raskolnikov$ again
i knew it cried $porfiry_petrovitch$ with vexation he was apparently so taken up with $nikolay$ that for a moment he had forgotten $mr_raskolnikov$
he was a little taken aback my dear $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ excuse me he flew up to him this wont do i afraid you must go
it no good your staying i will you see what a surprise good bye and taking him by the arm he showed him to the #door#
i suppose you didnt expect it said $mr_raskolnikov$ who though he had not yet fully grasped the situation had regained his courage
you did not expect it either my #friend# see how your #hand# is trembling he he you re trembling too $porfiry_petrovitch$
yes i am i didnt expect it they were already at the #door# $porfiry_petrovitch$ was impatient for $mr_raskolnikov$ to be gone
and your little surprise arent you going to show it to me $mr_raskolnikov$ said sarcastically why his teeth are chattering as he asks he he
you are an ironical person come till we meet i believe we can say good bye that in god #hand# muttered $porfiry_petrovitch$ with an unnatural smile
as he walked through the office $mr_raskolnikov$ noticed that many people were looking at him among them he saw the two porters from the house whom he had invited that night to the police station
they stood there waiting but he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of $porfiry_petrovitch$ behind him
one word $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ as to all the rest it in god #hand# but as a matter of form there are some questions i shall have to ask you
turning round he saw the latter running after him out of breath so we shall meet again shant we and $porfiry_petrovitch$ stood still facing him with a smile
shant we he added again he seemed to want to say #something# more but could not speak out you must forgive me $porfiry_petrovitch$ for what has just passed
i lost my #temper# began $mr_raskolnikov$ who had so far regained his courage that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness
dont mention it dont mention it $porfiry_petrovitch$ replied almost gleefully i myself too i have a wicked #temper# i admit it
but we shall meet again if it god will we may see a great deal of one another and will get to know each other through and through added $mr_raskolnikov$
yes know each other through and through assented $porfiry_petrovitch$ and he screwed up his eyes looking earnestly at $mr_raskolnikov$
now you re going to a birthday party to a funeral of course the funeral take care of yourself and get well
i dont know what to wish you said $mr_raskolnikov$ who had begun to descend the stairs but looked back again
i should like to wish you success but your office is such a comical one why comical $porfiry_petrovitch$ had turned to go but he seemed to prick up his ears at this
you must have been at him #day# and night proving to him that he was the murderer and now that he has confessed you ll begin vivisecting him again
why how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor $nikolay$ psychologically after your fashion till he confessed you are lying you ll say
you are not the murderer you cant be it not your own tale you are telling you must admit it a comical business
he he he you noticed then that i said to $nikolay$ just now that it was not his own tale he was telling
how could i help noticing it he he you are quick witted you notice everything you ve really a playful mind and you always fasten on the comic side
he he they say that was the marked characteristic of gogol among the writers yes of gogol yes of gogol
he was so muddled and bewildered that on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa trying to collect his #thought#
he did not attempt to think about $nikolay$ he was stupefied he felt that his confession was #something# inexplicable amazing #something# beyond his understanding
i shall look forward to meeting you so shall i $mr_raskolnikov$ walked straight home but $nikolay$ confession was an actual fact
the consequences of this fact were clear to him at once its falsehood could not fail to be discovered and then they would be after him again
till then at least he was free and must do #something# for himself for the danger was imminent but how imminent
his position gradually became clear to him remembering sketchily the main outlines of his recent scene with $porfiry_petrovitch$ he could not help shuddering again with horror
but he had already partly shown his #hand# and no one knew better than $mr_raskolnikov$ how terrible $porfiry_petrovitch$ lead had been for him
of course he did not yet know all $porfiry_petrovitch$ aims he could not see into all his calculations a little more
knowing his nervous #temperament# and from the first glance seeing through him $porfiry_petrovitch$ though playing a bold game was bound to win
there no denying that $mr_raskolnikov$ had compromised himself seriously but no facts had come to light as yet there was nothing positive
and he might have given himself away completely circumstantially but was he taking a true view of the position wasnt he mistaken
what had $porfiry_petrovitch$ been trying to get at had he really some surprise prepared for him and what was it had he really been expecting #something# or not
$porfiry_petrovitch$ had shown almost all his cards of course he had risked #something# in showing them and if he had really had anything up his sleeve $mr_raskolnikov$ reflected he would have shown that too
how would they have parted if it had not been for the unexpected appearance of $nikolay$ what was that surprise was it a joke
had it meant anything could it have concealed anything like a fact a piece of positive evidence his yesterday visitor what had become of him
where was he to #day# if $porfiry_petrovitch$ really had any evidence it must be connected with him he sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in his #hand#
he was still shivering nervously at last he got up took his cap #thought# a minute and went to the #door#
he had a sort of presentiment that for to #day# at least he might consider himself out of danger he had a sudden sense almost of joy he wanted to make haste to $katerina_ivanovna$
he would be too late for the funeral of course but he would be in time for the memorial dinner and there at once he would see $sonia$
he stood still #thought# a moment and a suffering smile came for a moment on to his lips to #day# to #day# he repeated to himself
yes to #day# so it must be but as he was about to open the #door# it began opening of itself
he started and moved back the #door# opened gently and slowly and there suddenly appeared a figure yesterday visitor from underground
he was exactly the same as yesterday the same figure the same dress but there was a great change in his face he looked dejected and sighed deeply
if he had only put his #hand# up to his cheek and leaned his #head# on one side he would have looked exactly like a peasant woman
the #man# stood in the doorway looked at $mr_raskolnikov$ without speaking and took a #step# forward into the room what do you want asked $mr_raskolnikov$ numb with terror
the #man# was still silent but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground touching it with his finger what is it cried $mr_raskolnikov$
i have sinned the #man# articulated softly how by evil #thought# they looked at one another i was vexed
when you came perhaps in drink and bade the porters go to the police station and asked about the blood i was vexed that they let you go and took you for drunken
i was so vexed that i lost my sleep and remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for you
who came $mr_raskolnikov$ interrupted instantly beginning to recollect i did i ve wronged you then you come from that house
i was standing at the gate with them dont you remember we have carried on our trade in that house for years past
and the whole scene of the #day# before yesterday in the gateway came clearly before $mr_raskolnikov$ mind he recollected that there had been several people there besides the porters women among them
we cure and prepare hides we take work home most of all i was vexed he remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the police station
he could not recall the face of the speaker and even now he did not recognise it but he remembered that he had turned round and made him some answer
the most awful #thought# was that he had been actually almost lost had almost done for himself on account of such a trivial circumstance
so this was the solution of yesterday horror so this #man# could tell nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains
so $porfiry_petrovitch$ too had nothing but that delirium no facts but this psychology which cuts both ways nothing positive
so if no more facts come to light and they must not they must not then then what can they do to him
how can they convict him even if they arrest him and $porfiry_petrovitch$ then had only just heard about the flat and had not known about it before
was it you who told $porfiry_petrovitch$ that i been there he cried struck by a sudden idea what $porfiry_petrovitch$
the #head# of the detective department yes the porters did not go there but i went to #day# i got there two minutes before you
and i heard i heard it all how he worried you where what when why in the next room i was sitting there all the time
i saw that the porters did not want to do what i said began the #man# for it too late said they and maybe he ll be angry that we did not come at the time
what why then you were the surprise but how could it happen upon my word i was vexed and i lost my sleep and i began making inquiries
and finding out yesterday where to go i went to #day# the first time i went he wasnt there when i came an hour later he couldnt see me
i informed him of everything just as it happened and he began skipping about the room and punching himself on the chest
i went the third time and they showed me in what do you scoundrels mean by it if i known about it i should have arrested him
then he ran out called somebody and began talking to him in the #corner# then he turned to me scolding and questioning me
he scolded me a great deal and i told him everything and i told him that you didnt dare to say a word in answer to me yesterday and that you didnt recognise me
and he fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest and getting angry and running about and when you were announced he told me to go into the next room
sit there a bit he said dont move whatever you may hear and he set a chair there for me and locked me in
perhaps he said i may call you and when $nikolay$ been brought he let me out as soon as you were gone
i shall send for you again and question you he said and did he question $nikolay$ while you were there
he got rid of me as he did of you before he spoke to $nikolay$ the #man# stood still and again suddenly bowed down touching the ground with his finger
and as he said this the #man# bowed down again but not to the ground turned slowly and went out of the room
it all cuts both ways now it all cuts both ways repeated $mr_raskolnikov$ and he went out more confident than ever
forgive me for my evil #thought# and my slander may god forgive you answered $mr_raskolnikov$ now we ll make a fight for it he said with a malicious smile as he went down the stairs
his malice was aimed at himself with shame and contempt he recollected his cowardice part chapter i the morning that followed the fateful interview with $dounia$ and her #mother# brought sobering influences to bear on $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
intensely unpleasant as it was he was forced little by little to accept as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the #day# before fantastic and incredible
the black snake of wounded vanity had been gnawing at his heart all night when he got out of bed $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ immediately looked in the looking glass
however his health seemed unimpaired so far and looking at his noble clear skinned countenance which had grown fattish of late $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ for an instant was positively comforted in the conviction that he would find another bride and perhaps even a better one
but coming back to the sense of his present position he turned aside and spat vigorously which excited a sarcastic smile in $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ the young #friend# with whom he was staying
he was afraid that he had jaundice that smile $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ noticed and at once set it down against his young #friend# account
his anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to have told $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ about the result of yesterday interview
he had set down a good many #point# against him of late that was the second mistake he had made in #temper# through impulsiveness and irritability
moreover all that morning one unpleasantness followed another he even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case in the senate
he was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being redecorated at his own expense the owner a rich german tradesman would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money though $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated
in the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single #rouble# of the instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the flat
am i to get married simply for the sake of the furniture $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a gleam of desperate #hope#
can all that be really so irrevocably over is it no use to make another effort the #thought# of $dounia$ sent a voluptuous pang through his heart
he endured anguish at that moment and if it had been possible to slay $mr_raskolnikov$ instantly by wishing it $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ would promptly have uttered the wish
it was my mistake too not to have given them money he #thought# as he returned dejectedly to $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ room and why on earth was i such a jew
i meant to keep them without a penny so that they should turn to me as their providence and look at them
if i spent some fifteen hundred #rouble# on them for the trousseau and presents on knick knacks dressing cases jewellery materials and all that sort of trash from knopp and the english shop my position would have been better and stronger
they are the sort of people that would feel bound to return money and presents if they broke it off and they would find it hard to do it
it was false economy foo they could not have refused me so easily and their conscience would prick them how can we dismiss a #man# who has hitherto been so generous and delicate
m i ve made a blunder and grinding his teeth again $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ called himself a fool but not aloud of course
he returned home twice as irritated and angry as before the preparations for the funeral dinner at $katerina_ivanovna$ excited his curiosity as he passed
he had heard about it the #day# before he fancied indeed that he had been invited but absorbed in his own cares he had paid no attention
inquiring of madame lippevechsel who was busy laying the table while $katerina_ivanovna$ was away at the cemetery he heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair that all the lodgers had been invited among them some who had not known the dead #man# that even $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ was invited in #spite# of his previous quarrel with $katerina_ivanovna$ that he $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ was not only invited but was eagerly expected as he was the most important of the lodgers
amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ herself had been invited with great ceremony in #spite# of the recent unpleasantness and so she was very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them
she was moreover dressed up to the nines all in new black silk and she was proud of it all this suggested an idea to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and he went into his room or rather $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ somewhat thoughtful
he had learnt that $mr_raskolnikov$ was to be one of the guests $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ had been at home all the morning
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ had despised and hated him from the #day# he came to stay with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him
he had not come to stay with him on his arrival in petersburg simply from parsimony though that had been perhaps his chief object
he had heard of $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ who had once been his ward as a leading young progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting circles the doings of which were a legend in the provinces
these powerful omniscient circles who despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a peculiar but quite vague alarm
the attitude of $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ to this gentleman was strange though perhaps natural it had impressed $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ he had not of course been able to form even an approximate notion of what they meant
he like everyone had heard that there were especially in petersburg progressives of some sort nihilists and so on and like many people he exaggerated and distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree
what for many years past he had feared more than anything was being shown up and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the #thought# of transferring his business to petersburg
some years before when he was just entering on his own career he had come upon two cases in which rather important personages in the province patrons of his had been cruelly shown up
one instance had ended in great scandal for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious trouble
for this reason $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ intended to go into the subject as soon as he reached petersburg and if necessary to anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of our younger generation
he relied on $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ for this and before his visit to $mr_raskolnikov$ he had succeeded in picking up some current phrases
he was afraid of this as little #child# are sometimes panic stricken he soon discovered that $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ was a commonplace simpleton but that by no means reassured $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
even if he had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him it would not have allayed his uneasiness
all the doctrines the ideas the systems with which $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ pestered him had no interest for him he had his own object he simply wanted to find out at once what was happening here
had these people any power or not had he anything to fear from them would they expose any enterprise of his
and what precisely was now the object of their attacks could he somehow make up to them and get round them if they really were powerful
was this the thing to do or not couldnt he gain #something# through them in fact hundreds of questions presented themselves
$andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ was an anæmic scrofulous little #man# with strangely flaxen mutton chop whiskers of which he was very proud he was a clerk and had almost always #something# wrong with his eyes
he was rather soft hearted but self confident and sometimes extremely conceited in speech which had an absurd effect incongruous with his little figure
he was one of the lodgers most respected by amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ for he did not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings
he was one of the numerous and varied legion of dullards of half animate abortions conceited half educated coxcombs who attach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve however sincerely
$andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ really was rather stupid he attached himself to the cause of progress and our younger generation from enthusiasm though $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ was so good natured he too was beginning to dislike $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
however simple $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ might be he began to see that $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ was duping him and secretly despising him and that he was not the right sort of #man#
he had tried expounding to him the system of fourier and the darwinian theory but of late $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ began to listen too sarcastically and even to be rude
the fact was he had begun instinctively to guess that $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ was not merely a commonplace simpleton but perhaps a liar too and that he had no connections of any consequence even in his own circle but had simply picked things up third #hand# and that very likely he did not even know much about his own work of propaganda for he was in too great a muddle
it must be noted by the way that $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ had during those ten #day# eagerly accepted the strangest praise from $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ he had not protested for instance when $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ belauded him for being ready to contribute to the establishment of the new commune or to abstain from christening his future #child# or to acquiesce if $dounia$ were to take a lover a month after marriage and so on
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ so enjoyed hearing his own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were attributed to him
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ had had occasion that morning to realise some five per cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over bundles of notes
$andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ who hardly ever had any money walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank notes with indifference and even contempt
nothing would have convinced $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ that $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ could really look on the money unmoved and the latter on his side kept thinking bitterly that $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and was perhaps glad of the opportunity of teasing his young #friend# by reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them
he found him incredibly inattentive and irritable though he $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ began enlarging on his favourite subject the foundation of a new special commune
the brief remarks that dropped from $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame betrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony
but the humane $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ ascribed $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ ill humour to his recent breach with $dounia$ and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that theme
he had #something# progressive to say on the subject which might console his worthy #friend# and could not fail to promote his development
this happened on both sides unconsciously a fine person he would be to show #anyone# up there is some sort of festivity being prepared at that at the widow isnt there
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ asked suddenly interrupting $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ at the most interesting passage why dont you know why i was telling you last night what i think about all such ceremonies
i should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on this feast all the money she got from that other fool $mr_raskolnikov$
and she invited you too i heard you were talking to her yesterday i was surprised just now as i came through at the preparations there the wines
several people are invited it beyond everything continued $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ who seemed to have some object in pursuing the conversation
what you say i am asked too when was that i dont remember but i shant go why should i
i only said a word to her in passing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year salary as a destitute widow of a government clerk
i suppose she has invited me on that account hasnt she he he he i dont intend to go either said $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$
i should think not after giving her a thrashing you might well hesitate he he who thrashed whom cried $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ flustered and blushing
so that what your convictions amount to and the woman question too wasnt quite sound he he he and $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ as though comforted went back to clicking his beads
why you thrashed $katerina_ivanovna$ a month ago i heard so yesterday it all slander and nonsense cried $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ who was always afraid of allusions to the subject
it was not like that at all it was quite different you ve heard it wrong it a libel i was simply defending myself
it permissable for #anyone# i should #hope# to defend himself and i never allow #anyone# to use violence to me on principle for it an act of despotism
she rushed at me first with her nails she pulled out all my whiskers what was i to do i simply pushed her back
he he he $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ went on laughing maliciously you keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself
you dont understand i used to think indeed that if women are equal to #man# in all respects even in strength as is maintained now there ought to be equality in that too
of course i reflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise for there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is unthinkable and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality in fighting
i am not so stupid though of course there is fighting there wont be later but at present there is confound it
but that nonsense and it has nothing nothing whatever to do with the woman question how muddled one gets with you
it not on that account that i am not going i am not going on principle not to take part in the revolting convention of memorial dinners that why
though of course one might go to laugh at it i am sorry there wont be any priests at it i should certainly go if there were
then you would sit down at another #man# table and insult it and those who invited you eh certainly not insult but protest
i should do it with a good object i might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda it a duty of every #man# to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the more harshly perhaps the better
i might drop a seed an idea and #something# might grow up from that seed how should i be insulting them
they might be offended at first but afterwards they see i done them a service you know terebyeva who is in the community now was blamed because when she left her family and devoted
herself she wrote to her father and #mother# that she wouldnt go on living conventionally and was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh that she might have spared them and have written more kindly
varents had been married seven years she abandoned her two #child# she told her husband straight out in a letter i have realised that i cannot be happy with you
i can never forgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there is another organisation of society by means of the communities
i have only lately learned it from a great hearted #man# to whom i have given myself and with whom i am establishing a community
i think that all nonsense and there no need of softness on the contrary what wanted is protest i speak plainly because i consider it dishonest to deceive you
do as you think best do not #hope# to get me back you are too late i #hope# you will be happy
that how letters like that ought to be written is that terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage
no it only the second really but what if it were the fourth what if it were the fifteenth that all nonsense
and if ever i regretted the death of my father and #mother# it is now and i sometimes think if my parents were living what a protest i would have aimed at them
i would have done #something# on purpose i would have shown them i would have astonished them i am really sorry there is no one
well be that as you will $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ interrupted but tell me this do you know the dead #man# daughter the delicate looking little thing
to surprise he he it true what they say about her isnt it what of it i think that is it is my own personal conviction that this is the normal condition of women
in our present society it is not altogether normal because it is compulsory but in the future society it will be perfectly normal because it will be voluntary
she was suffering and that was her asset so to speak her capital which she had a perfect right to dispose of
of course in the future society there will be no need of assets but her part will have another significance rational and in harmony with her environment
as to $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ personally i regard her action as a vigorous protest against the organisation of society and i respect her deeply for it
why not i mean distinguons even as it is she was quite right i rejoice indeed when i look at her
i was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ was enraged that another slander he yelled
it was not so at all that was all $katerina_ivanovna$ invention for she did not understand and i never made love to $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$
i was simply developing her entirely disinterestedly trying to rouse her to protest all i wanted was her protest and $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ could not have remained here anyway
have you asked her to join your community you keep on laughing and very inappropriately allow me to tell you you dont understand
in a community such a rôle is essentially transformed and what is stupid here is sensible there what under present conditions is unnatural becomes perfectly natural in the community
there is no such rôle in a community the community is established that there should be no such rôles it all depends on the environment
and i am on good terms with $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ to this #day# which is a proof that she never regarded me as having wronged her
it all the environment and #man# himself is nothing i am trying now to attract her to the community but on quite quite a different footing
what are you laughing at we are trying to establish a community of our own a special one on a broader basis
we have gone further in our convictions we reject more and meanwhile i still developing $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ she has a beautiful beautiful character
and you take advantage of her fine character eh he he no no oh no on the contrary oh on the contrary
he he he a queer thing to say believe me why should i disguise it in fact i feel it strange myself how timid chaste and modern
she is with me and you of course are developing her he he trying to prove to her that all that modesty is nonsense
not at all not at all how coarsely how stupidly excuse me saying so you misunderstand the word development good heavens how crude you still are
setting aside the general question of chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed prejudices i fully accept her chastity with me because that for her to decide
of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me i should think myself very lucky because i like the girl very much but as it is no one has ever treated her more courteously than i with more respect for her dignity
we are striving for the freedom of women and you have only one idea in your #head# i wait in #hope# that all
you had much better make her a present of #something# i bet you never #thought# of that you dont understand as i ve told you already
seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider deserving of contempt you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow creature
of course she is in such a position but it another question quite another question you simply despise her you dont know what a character she is
i am only sorry that of late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books i used to lend them to her
i am sorry too that with all the energy and resolution in protesting which she has already shown once she has little self reliance little so to say independence so as to break free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas
yet she thoroughly understands some questions for instance about kissing of #hand# that is that it an insult to a woman for a #man# to kiss her #hand# because it a sign of inequality
we had a debate about it and i described it to her she listened attentively to an account of the workmen associations in france too
we had a debate lately on the question has a member of the community the right to enter another member room whether #man# or woman at any time and we decided that he has
now i am explaining the question of coming into the room in the future society and what that pray it might be at an inconvenient moment he he
$andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ was really angry you are always thinking of #something# unpleasant he cried with aversion tfoo how vexed i am that when i was expounding our system i referred prematurely to the question of personal privacy
it always a stumbling block to people like you they turn it into ridicule before they understand it and how proud they are of it too
i ve often maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till he has a firm faith in the system
tfoo and tell me please what do you find so shameful even in cesspools i should be the first to be ready to clean out any cesspool you like
and it not a question of self sacrifice it simply work honourable useful work which is as good as any other and much better than the work of a raphael and a pushkin because it is more useful
and more honourable more honourable he he he what do you mean by more honourable i dont understand such expressions to describe human activity
more honourable nobler all those are old fashioned prejudices which i reject everything which is of use to mankind is honourable i only understand one word useful
you can snigger as much as you like but that so $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ laughed heartily he had finished counting the money and was putting it away
but some of the notes he left on the table the cesspool question had already been a subject of dispute between them
what was absurd was that it made $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ really angry while it amused $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his young #friend#
it your ill luck yesterday that makes you so ill humoured and annoying blurted out $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ who in #spite# of his independence and his protests
did not venture to oppose $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and still behaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier years
you better tell me this $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ interrupted with haughty displeasure can you or rather are you really friendly enough with that young person to ask her to #step# in here for a minute
i think they ve all come back from the cemetery i heard the sound of #step# i want to see her that young person
what for $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ asked with surprise oh i want to i am leaving here to #day# or to morrow and therefore i wanted to speak to her about
however you may be present during the interview it better you should be indeed for there no knowing what you might imagine
i shant imagine anything i only asked and if you ve anything to say to her nothing is easier than to call her in
i ll go directly and you may be sure i wont be in your way five minutes later $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ came in with $sonia$
she was always shy in such circumstances and was always afraid of new people she had been as a #child# and was even more so now
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ met her politely and affably but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in his opinion was suitable for a #man# of his respectability and weight in dealing with a creature so young and so interesting as she
she came in very much surprised and overcome with shyness as usual he hastened to reassure her and made her sit down facing him at the table
$sonia$ sat down looked about her at $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ at the notes lying on the table and then again at $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and her eyes remained riveted on him
$andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ was moving to the #door# $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ signed to $sonia$ to remain seated and stopped $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ is $mr_raskolnikov$ in there
has he come he asked him in a whisper $mr_raskolnikov$ yes why yes he is there i saw him just come in
why well i particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave me alone with this young woman
i only want a few words with her but god knows what they may make of it i shouldnt like $mr_raskolnikov$ to repeat anything
you understand what i mean i understand $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ saw the #point# yes you are right of course i am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy but still you are right
certainly i ll stay i ll stand here at the window and not be in your way i think you are right
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ returned to the sofa sat down opposite $sonia$ looked attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified even severe expression as much as to say dont you make any mistake madam
$sonia$ was overwhelmed with embarrassment in the first place $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ will you make my excuses to your respected mamma
that right isnt it $katerina_ivanovna$ stands in the place of a #mother# to you $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ began with great dignity though affably
it was evident that his #intention# were friendly quite so yes the place of a #mother# $sonia$ answered timidly and hurriedly
through inevitable circumstances i am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in #spite# of your mamma #kind# invitation
then will you make my apologies to her yes i ll tell her at once and $sonia$ hastily jumped up from her seat
wait that not all $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ detained her smiling at her simplicity and ignorance of good manners and you know me little my dear $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ if you suppose i would have ventured to trouble a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself only
her eyes rested again for an instant on the grey and rainbow coloured notes that remained on the table but she quickly looked away and fixed her eyes on $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
i have another object $sonia$ sat down hurriedly she felt it horribly indecorous especially for her to look at another person money
she stared at the gold eye glass which $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ held in his left #hand# and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a yellow stone on his middle finger
but suddenly she looked away and not knowing where to turn ended by staring $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ again straight in the face
after a pause of still greater dignity he continued i chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with $katerina_ivanovna$ poor woman
that was sufficient to enable me to ascertain that she is in a position preternatural if one may so express it
yes preternatural $sonia$ hurriedly assented or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say ill yes simpler and more comprehen
so then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak compassion i should be glad to be of service to her in any way foreseeing her unfortunate position
allow me to ask $sonia$ rose to her feet did you say #something# to her yesterday of the possibility of a pension
yes ill quite so i believe the whole of this #poverty# stricken family depends now entirely on you because she told me you had undertaken to get her one
i merely hinted at her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had died in the service if only she has patronage
but apparently your late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the service at all of late
in fact if there could be any #hope# it would be very ephemeral because there would be no claim for assistance in that case far from it
was that true not in the slightest and indeed it an absurdity and she is dreaming of a pension already he he he
a go ahead lady yes she is for she is credulous and good hearted and she believes everything from the goodness of her heart and
and and she is like that yes you must excuse her said $sonia$ and again she got up to go
but you havent heard what i have to say no i havent heard muttered $sonia$ then sit down
seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones i should be glad as i have said before so far as lies in my power to be of service that is so far as is in my power not more
one might for instance get up a subscription for her or a lottery #something# of the sort such as is always arranged in such cases by #friend# or even outsiders desirous of assisting people
she was terribly confused she sat down again a third time it was of that i intended to speak to you it might be done
yes yes god will repay you for it faltered $sonia$ gazing intently at $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ it might be but we will talk of it later
we might begin it to #day# we will talk it over this #evening# and lay the foundation so to speak come to me at seven clock
but there is one circumstance of which i ought to warn you beforehand and for which i venture to trouble you $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ to come here
mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ i #hope# will assist us in my opinion money cannot be indeed it unsafe to put it into $katerina_ivanovna$ own #hand#
the dinner to #day# is a proof of that though she has not so to speak a crust of bread for to morrow and
well boots or shoes or anything she has bought to #day# jamaica rum and even i believe madeira and and coffee i saw it as i passed through
it absurd really and so to my thinking a subscription ought to be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money but only you for instance
to morrow it will all fall upon you again they wont have a crust of bread am i right i dont know this is only to #day# once in her life
but just as you think and i shall be very very they will all be and god will reward and the orphans
she was so anxious to do honour to celebrate the memory and she is very sensible $sonia$ burst into tears
very well then keep it in mind and now will you accept for the benefit of your relation the small sum that i am able to spare from me personally
i am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in connection with it here having so to speak anxieties of my own i cannot do more
and $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ held out to $sonia$ a ten #rouble# note carefully unfolded $sonia$ took it flushed crimson jumped up muttered #something# and began taking leave
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ accompanied her ceremoniously to the #door# she got out of the room at last agitated and distressed and returned to $katerina_ivanovna$ overwhelmed with #confusion#
all this time $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ had stood at the window or walked about the room anxious not to interrupt the conversation when $sonia$ had gone he walked up to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and solemnly held out his #hand#
i heard and saw everything he said laying stress on the last verb that is honourable i mean to say it humane
and although i cannot i confess in principle sympathise with private charity for it not only fails to eradicate the evil but even promotes it yet i must admit that i saw your action with pleasure yes yes i like it
you wanted to avoid gratitude i saw that all nonsense muttered $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ somewhat disconcerted looking carefully at $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$
a #man# who has suffered distress and annoyance as you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the #misery# of others such a #man# even though he is making a social mistake is still deserving of respect
no it not nonsense i did not expect it indeed of you $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ especially as according to your ideas
how distressed you are for instance by your ill luck yesterday cried the simple hearted $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ who felt a return of affection for $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
oh what a drawback your ideas are to you and what do you want with marriage with legal marriage my dear noble $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
well you may beat me if you like but i am glad positively glad it hasnt come off that you are free that you are not quite lost for humanity
because i dont want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and to bring up another #man# #child# that why i want legal marriage $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ replied in order to make some answer
why do you cling to this legality of marriage you see i ve spoken my mind he seemed preoccupied by #something#
#child# are a social question and a question of first importance i agree but the question of #child# has another solution
#child# you referred to #child# $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ started off like a warhorse at the trumpet call some refuse to have #child# altogether because they suggest the institution of the family
we ll speak of #child# later but now as to the question of honour i confess that my weak #point# that horrid military pushkin expression is unthinkable in the dictionary of the future
what does it mean indeed it nonsense there will be no deception in a free marriage that is only the natural consequence of a legal marriage so to say its corrective a protest
so that indeed it not humiliating and if i ever to suppose an absurdity were to be legally married i should be positively glad of it
i should say to my wife my dear hitherto i have loved you now i respect you for you ve shown you can protest
i understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage but it simply a despicable consequence of a despicable position in which both are humiliated
you laugh that because you are incapable of getting away from prejudices confound it all when the deception is open as in a free marriage then it does not exist it unthinkable
your wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for her new husband
i mean if i were to marry legally or not it just the same i should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for herself
damn it all i sometimes dream if i were to be married pfoo my dear i should say i love you but even more than that i #desire# you to respect me
see am i not right $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ sniggered as he listened but without much merriment he hardly heard it indeed he was preoccupied with #something# else and even $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ at last noticed it
it would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the idea of that senseless dinner in $katerina_ivanovna$ disordered brain
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ seemed excited and rubbed his #hand# $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ remembered all this and reflected upon it afterwards chapter ii nearly ten of the twenty #rouble# given by $mr_raskolnikov$ for $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ funeral were wasted upon it
possibly $katerina_ivanovna$ felt obliged to honour the memory of the deceased suitably that all the lodgers and still more amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ might know that he was in no way their inferior and perhaps very much their superior and that no one had the right to turn up his nose at him
perhaps the chief element was that peculiar poor #man# pride which compels many poor people to spend their last savings on some traditional social ceremony simply in order to do like other people and not to be looked down upon
it is very probable too that $katerina_ivanovna$ longed on this occasion at the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone to show those wretched contemptible lodgers that she knew how to do things how to entertain and that she had been brought up in a genteel she might almost say aristocratic colonel family and had not been meant for sweeping floors and washing the #child# rags at night
even the poorest and most broken spirited people are sometimes liable to these paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous craving
and $katerina_ivanovna$ was not broken spirited she might have been killed by circumstance but her spirit could not have been broken that is she could not have been intimidated her will could not be crushed
she could not be said to be insane but for a year past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained
moreover $sonia$ had said with good reason that her mind was unhinged the later stages of consumption are apt
doctors tell us to affect the intellect there was no great variety of wines nor was there madeira but wine there was
besides the traditional rice and honey there were three or four dishes one of which consisted of pancakes all prepared in amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ kitchen
there was vodka rum and lisbon wine all of the poorest quality but in sufficient quantity two samovars were boiling that tea and punch might be offered after dinner
$katerina_ivanovna$ had herself seen to purchasing the provisions with the help of one of the lodgers an unfortunate little pole who had somehow been stranded at madame lippevechsel
he promptly put himself at $katerina_ivanovna$ disposal and had been all that morning and all the #day# before running about as fast as his legs could carry him and very anxious that everyone should be aware of it
for every trifle he ran to $katerina_ivanovna$ even hunting her out at the bazaar at every instant called her pani
she was heartily sick of him before the #end# though she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this serviceable and magnanimous #man#
her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing she would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance and quite genuinely believe in their reality
then all of a sudden she would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring
she was naturally of a gay lively and peace loving disposition but from continual failures and misfortunes she had come to #desire# so keenly that all should live in peace and joy and should not dare to break the peace that the slightest jar the smallest disaster reduced her almost to frenzy and she would pass in an instant from the brightest #hope# and fancies to cursing her fate and raving and knocking her #head# against the #wall#
amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ too suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in $katerina_ivanovna$ eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary respect probably only because amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ had thrown herself heart and soul into the preparations
she had undertaken to lay the table to provide the linen crockery etc and to cook the dishes in her kitchen and $katerina_ivanovna$ had left it all in her #hand# and gone herself to the cemetery
it was one of $katerina_ivanovna$ characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours everything had been well done
even the table cloth was nearly clean the crockery knives forks and glasses were of course of all shapes and patterns lent by different lodgers but the table was properly laid at the time fixed and amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ feeling she had done her work well had put on a black silk dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some pride
this pride though justifiable displeased $katerina_ivanovna$ for some reason as though the table could not have been laid except by amalia $katerina_ivanovna$
could she be stuck up the stupid german because she was mistress of the house and had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers
$katerina_ivanovna$ father who had been a colonel and almost a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons and then #anyone# like amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ or rather $amalia_ludwigovna$ would not have been allowed into the kitchen
$katerina_ivanovna$ however put off expressing her feelings for the time and contented herself with treating her coldly though she decided inwardly that she would certainly have to put amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ down and set her in her proper place for goodness only knew what she was fancying herself
$katerina_ivanovna$ was irritated too by the fact that hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral except the pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery while to the memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned up the wretched creatures many of them not quite sober
she disliked the cap with new ribbons too as a favour fancy that the older and more respectable of them all as if by common consent stayed away
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ for instance who might be said to be the most respectable of all the lodgers did not appear though $katerina_ivanovna$ had the #evening# before told all the world that is amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ $polenka$ $sonia$ and the pole that he was the most generous noble hearted #man# with a large property and vast connections who had been a #friend# of her first husband and a guest in her father house and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her a considerable pension
it must be noted that when $katerina_ivanovna$ exalted #anyone# connections and fortune it was without any ulterior motive quite disinterestedly for the mere pleasure of adding to the consequence of the person praised
he was only asked out of kindness and because he was sharing the same room with $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and was a #friend# of his so that it would have been awkward not to invite him
probably taking his cue from $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ that contemptible wretch $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ had not turned up either what did he fancy himself
among those who failed to appear were the genteel lady and her old maidish daughter who had only been lodgers in the house for the last fortnight but had several times complained of the noise and uproar in $katerina_ivanovna$ room especially when $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ had come back drunk
$katerina_ivanovna$ heard this from amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ who quarrelling with $katerina_ivanovna$ and threatening to turn the whole family out of #door# had shouted at her that they were not worth the foot of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing
$katerina_ivanovna$ determined now to invite this lady and her daughter whose foot she was not worth and who had turned away haughtily when she casually met them so that they might know that she was more noble in her #thought# and feelings and did not harbour malice and might see that she was not accustomed to her way of living
she had proposed to make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father governorship and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly stupid of them to turn away on meeting her
the fat colonel major he was really a discharged officer of low rank was also absent but it appeared that he had been not himself for the last two #day#
the party consisted of the pole a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat who had not a word to say for himself and smelt abominably a deaf and almost blind old #man# who had once been in the post office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone at amalia $katerina_ivanovna$
a retired clerk of the commissariat department came too he was drunk had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy was without a waistcoat
finally one person having no suit appeared in his dressing gown but this was too much and the efforts of amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ and the pole succeeded in removing him
the pole brought with him however two other poles who did not live at amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ and whom no one had seen here before
one of the visitors sat straight down to the table without even greeting $katerina_ivanovna$ all this irritated $katerina_ivanovna$ intensely
to make room for the visitors the #child# had not even been laid for at the table but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the furthest #corner# with their dinner laid on a box while $polenka$ as a big girl had to look after them feed them and keep their noses wiped like well bred #child#
for whom had they made all these preparations then $katerina_ivanovna$ in fact could hardly help meeting her guests with increased dignity and even haughtiness
rushing to the conclusion that amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ must be responsible for those who were absent she began treating her with extreme nonchalance which the latter promptly observed and resented
she stared at some of them with special severity and loftily invited them to take their seats such a beginning was no good omen for the #end#
$katerina_ivanovna$ was greatly delighted to see him in the first place because he was the one educated visitor and as everyone knew was in two years to take a professorship in the university and secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having been unable to be at the funeral
all were seated at last $mr_raskolnikov$ came in almost at the moment of their return from the cemetery she positively pounced upon him and made him sit on her left #hand# amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ was on her right
in #spite# of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round correctly and that everyone should taste them in #spite# of the agonising cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse during the last few #day# she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to $mr_raskolnikov$ all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at the failure of the dinner interspersing her remarks with lively and uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of her landlady
it all that cuckoo fault you know whom i mean her her $katerina_ivanovna$ nodded towards the landlady
look at her she making round eyes she feels that we are talking about her and cant understand pfoo the owl
have you noticed that she wants everyone to consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being here
i asked her like a sensible woman to invite people especially those who knew my late husband and look at the set of fools she has brought
ha ha cough cough cough and what does she put on that cap for cough cough cough the sweeps look at that one with the spotty face
and those wretched poles ha ha ha cough cough cough not one of them has ever poked his nose in here i ve never set eyes on them
what have they come here for i ask you there they sit in a row hey pan she cried suddenly to one of them have you tasted the pancakes
take some more have some beer wont you have some vodka look he jumped up and is making his bows they must be quite starved poor things
never mind let them eat they dont make a noise anyway though i really afraid for our landlady silver spoons amalia $katerina_ivanovna$
she addressed her suddenly almost aloud if your spoons should happen to be stolen i wont be responsible i warn you
ha ha ha she laughed turning to $mr_raskolnikov$ and again nodding towards the landlady in high glee at her sally
she didnt understand she didnt understand again look how she sits with her mouth open an owl a real owl an owl in new ribbons ha ha ha
here her laugh turned again to an insufferable #fit# of coughing that lasted five minutes drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead and her handkerchief was stained with blood
she showed $mr_raskolnikov$ the blood in silence and as soon as she could get her breath began whispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her cheeks
do you know i gave her the most delicate instructions so to speak for inviting that lady and her daughter
it needed the utmost delicacy the greatest nicety but she has managed things so that that fool that conceited baggage that provincial nonentity simply because she is the widow of a major and has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the government offices because at fifty she paints her face everybody knows it
a creature like that did not think #fit# to come and has not even answered the invitation which the most ordinary good manners required
you understand of whom i am speaking i cant understand why $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ has not come but where $sonia$ where has she gone
ah there she is at last what is it $sonia$ where have you been it odd that even at your father funeral you should be so unpunctual
$rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ make room for her beside you that your place $sonia$ take what you like have some of the cold entrée with jelly that the best
they ll bring the pancakes directly have they given the #child# some $polenka$ have you got everything cough cough cough that all right be a good girl lida and $kolya$ dont fidget with your feet sit like a little gentleman
$sonia$ hastened to give her $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ apologies trying to speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most respectful phrases which she attributed to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
she added that $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ had particularly told her to say that as soon as he possibly could he would come immediately to discuss business alone with her and to consider what could be done for her etc etc
what are you saying $sonia$ sonia knew that this would comfort $katerina_ivanovna$ would flatter her and gratify her pride she sat down beside $mr_raskolnikov$ she made him a hurried bow glancing curiously at him
but for the rest of the time she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him she seemed absent minded though she kept looking at $katerina_ivanovna$ trying to please her
neither she nor $katerina_ivanovna$ had been able to get mourning $sonia$ was wearing dark brown and $katerina_ivanovna$ had on her only dress a dark striped cotton one
listening to $sonia$ with dignity $katerina_ivanovna$ inquired with equal dignity how $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ was then at once whispered almost aloud to $mr_raskolnikov$ that it certainly would have been strange for a #man# of $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ position and standing to find himself in such extraordinary company in #spite# of his devotion to her family and his old friendship with her father
that why i am so grateful to you $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ that you have not disdained my hospitality even in such surroundings she added almost aloud
but i am sure that it was only your special affection for my poor husband that has made you keep your promise
then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors and suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf #man#
the message from $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ was very successful wouldnt he have some more meat and had he been given some wine
the old #man# made no answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked though his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him
he simply gazed about him with his mouth open which only increased the general mirth what an imbecile look look
but as to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ i always had confidence in him $katerina_ivanovna$ continued and of course he is not like with an extremely stern face she addressed amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ so sharply and loudly that the latter was quite disconcerted not like your dressed up draggletails whom my father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen and my late husband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the goodness of his heart
why was he brought yes he was fond of drink he was fond of it he did drink cried the commissariat clerk gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka
my late husband certainly had that weakness and everyone knows it $katerina_ivanovna$ attacked him at once but he was a #kind# and honourable #man# who loved and respected his family
the worst of it was his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people and he drank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe
would you believe it $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ they found a gingerbread cock in his #pocket# he was dead drunk but he did not forget the #child#
a cock did you say a cock shouted the commissariat clerk $katerina_ivanovna$ did not vouchsafe a reply she sighed lost in #thought#
no doubt you think like everyone that i was too severe with him she went on addressing $mr_raskolnikov$ but that not so
he respected me he respected me very much he was a #kind# hearted #man# and how sorry i was for him sometimes
he would sit in a #corner# and look at me i used to feel so sorry for him i used to want to be #kind# to him and then would think to myself be #kind# to him and he will drink again it was only by severity that you could keep him within bounds
yes he used to get his hair pulled pretty often roared the commissariat clerk again swallowing another glass of vodka
some fools would be the better for a good drubbing as well as having their hair pulled i am not talking of my late husband now
$katerina_ivanovna$ snapped at him the flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked her chest heaved in another minute she would have been ready to make a scene
many of the visitors were sniggering evidently delighted they began poking the commissariat clerk and whispering #something# to him they were evidently trying to egg him on
allow me to ask what are you alluding to began the clerk that is to say whose about whom did you say just now
but i dont care that nonsense widow i forgive you pass and he took another drink of vodka $mr_raskolnikov$ sat in silence listening with disgust
he only ate from politeness just tasting the food that $katerina_ivanovna$ was continually putting on his plate to avoid hurting her feelings
but $sonia$ became more and more anxious and distressed she too foresaw that the dinner would not #end# peaceably and saw with terror $katerina_ivanovna$ growing irritation
he watched $sonia$ intently she knew that she $sonia$ was the chief reason for the genteel ladies contemptuous treatment of $katerina_ivanovna$ invitation
she had heard from amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ that the #mother# was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the question how could she let her daughter sit down beside that young person
$sonia$ had a feeling that $katerina_ivanovna$ had already heard this and an insult to $sonia$ meant more to $katerina_ivanovna$ than an insult to herself her #child# or her father $sonia$ knew that $katerina_ivanovna$ would not be satisfied now till she had shown those draggletails that they were both to make matters worse someone passed $sonia$ from the other #end# of the table a plate with two hearts pierced with an arrow cut out of black bread
$katerina_ivanovna$ flushed crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the #man# who sent it was a drunken ass
amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ was foreseeing #something# amiss and at the same time deeply wounded by $katerina_ivanovna$ haughtiness and to restore the good humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began apropos of nothing telling a #story# about an acquaintance of hers
karl from the chemist who was driving one night in a cab and that the cabman wanted him to kill and karl very much begged him not to kill and wept and clasped #hand# and frightened and from fear pierced his heart
though $katerina_ivanovna$ smiled she observed at once that amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ ought not to tell anecdotes in russian the latter was still more offended and she retorted that her vater aus berlin was a very important #man# and always went with his #hand# in #pocket#
$katerina_ivanovna$ could not restrain herself and laughed so much that amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ lost patience and could scarcely control herself
$katerina_ivanovna$ whispered at once her good humour almost restored she meant to say he kept his #hand# in his #pocket# but she said he put his #hand# in people #pocket#
listen to the owl cough cough and have you noticed $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ that all these petersburg foreigners the germans especially are all stupider than we
can you fancy #anyone# of us telling how karl from the chemist pierced his heart from fear and that the idiot instead of punishing the cabman clasped his #hand# and wept and much begged
to my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal cleverer anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with drink but you know these foreigners are always so well behaved and serious
ah the fool and you know she fancies it very touching and does not suspect how stupid she is look how she sits glaring
regaining her good humour $katerina_ivanovna$ began at once telling $mr_raskolnikov$ that when she had obtained her pension she intended to open a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native townt
this was the first time she had spoken to him of the project and she launched out into the most alluring details
it suddenly appeared that $katerina_ivanovna$ had in her #hand# the very certificate of honour of which $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ had spoken to $mr_raskolnikov$ in the tavern when he told him that $katerina_ivanovna$ his wife had danced the shawl dance before the governor and other great personages on leaving school
this certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove $katerina_ivanovna$ right to open a boarding school but she had armed herself with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming those two stuck up draggletails if they came to the dinner and proving incontestably that $katerina_ivanovna$ was of the most noble she might even say aristocratic family a colonel daughter and was far superior to certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late
the certificate of honour immediately passed into the #hand# of the drunken guests and $katerina_ivanovna$ did not try to retain it for it actually contained the statement en toutes lettres that her father was of the rank of a major and also a companion of an order so that she really was almost the daughter of a colonel
warming up $katerina_ivanovna$ proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and happy life they would lead int on the gymnasium teachers whom she would engage to give lessons in her boarding school one a most respectable old frenchman one mangot who had taught $katerina_ivanovna$ herself in old #day# and was still living int and would no doubt teach in her school on moderate terms
she is angry ha ha cough cough cough next she spoke of $sonia$ who would go with her tot and help her in all her plans
though $katerina_ivanovna$ tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of it she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of $sonia$ undoubted ability to assist her of her gentleness patience devotion generosity and good education tapping $sonia$ on the cheek and kissing her warmly twice
$sonia$ flushed crimson and $katerina_ivanovna$ suddenly burst into tears immediately observing that she was nervous and silly that she was too much upset that it was time to finish and as the dinner was over it was time to #hand# round the tea
at that moment amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ deeply aggrieved at taking no part in the conversation and not being listened to made one last effort and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty observation that in the future boarding school she would have to pay particular attention to die wäsche and that there certainly must be a good dame to look after the linen and secondly that the young ladies must not novels at night read
$katerina_ivanovna$ who certainly was upset and very tired as well as heartily sick of the dinner at once cut short amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ saying she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense that it was the business of the laundry maid and not of the directress of a high class boarding school to look after die wäsche and as for novel reading that was simply rudeness and she begged her to be silent
amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ fired up and getting angry observed that she only meant her good and that she had meant her very good and that it was long since she had paid her gold for the lodgings
$katerina_ivanovna$ at once set her down saying that it was a lie to say she wished her good because only yesterday when her dead husband was lying on the table she had worried her about the lodgings
to this amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ very appropriately observed that she had invited those ladies but those ladies had not come because those ladies are ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady
$katerina_ivanovna$ at once pointed out to her that as she was a slut she could not judge what made one really a lady
amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ at once declared that her vater aus berlin was a very very important #man# and both #hand# in #pocket# went and always used to say poof
at this someone at the further #end# of the table gave a sudden guffaw poof
and she leapt up from the table to represent her father sticking her #hand# in her #pocket# puffing her cheeks and uttering vague sounds resembling poof
but this was too much for $katerina_ivanovna$ and she at once declared so that all could hear that amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ probably never had a father but was simply a drunken petersburg finn and had certainly once been a cook and probably #something# worse
amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ turned as red as a lobster and squealed that perhaps $katerina_ivanovna$ never had a father but she had a vater aus berlin and that he wore a long coat and always said poof poof poof
$katerina_ivanovna$ observed contemptuously that all knew what her family was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print that her father was a colonel while amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ father if she really had one was probably some finnish milkman but that probably she never had a father at all since it was still uncertain whether her name was amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ or $amalia_ludwigovna$
at this amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ lashed to fury struck the table with her fist and shrieked that she was amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ and not $amalia_ludwigovna$ that her vater was named johann and that he was a burgomeister and that $katerina_ivanovna$ vater was quite never a burgomeister
$katerina_ivanovna$ rose from her chair and with a stern and apparently calm voice though she was pale and her chest was heaving observed that if she dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa she $katerina_ivanovna$ would tear her cap off her #head# and trample it under foot
amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ ran about the room shouting at the top of her voice that she was mistress of the house and that $katerina_ivanovna$ should leave the lodgings that minute then she rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table
poof amid loud laughter from all the lodgers who purposely encouraged amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ hoping for a fight there was a great outcry and uproar the #child# began crying
$sonia$ ran to restrain $katerina_ivanovna$ but when amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ shouted #something# about the yellow ticket $katerina_ivanovna$ pushed $sonia$ away and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat
at that minute the #door# opened and $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ appeared on the threshold he stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant eyes
make this foolish woman understand that she cant behave like this to a lady in misfortune that there is a law for such things
$katerina_ivanovna$ rushed to him chapter iii $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ she cried protect me you at least i ll go to the governor general himself
she shall answer for it remembering my father hospitality protect these orphans allow me madam allow me $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ waved her off
your papa as you are well aware i had not the honour of knowing someone laughed aloud and i do not intend to take part in your everlasting squabbles with amalia $katerina_ivanovna$
i have come here to speak of my own affairs and i want to have a word with your stepdaughter $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ $katerina_ivanovna$ i think it is
allow me to pass $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ edging by her went to the opposite #corner# where $sonia$ was $katerina_ivanovna$ remained standing where she was as though thunderstruck
she could not understand how $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ could deny having enjoyed her father hospitality though she had invented it herself she believed in it firmly by this time
she was struck too by the businesslike dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ all the clamour gradually died away at his entrance
not only was this serious business #man# strikingly incongruous with the rest of the party but it was evident too that he had come upon some matter of consequence that some exceptional cause must have brought him and that therefore #something# was going to happen
a minute later $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ too appeared in the doorway he did not come in but stood still listening with marked interest almost wonder and seemed for a time perplexed
$mr_raskolnikov$ standing beside $sonia$ moved aside to let him pass $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ did not seem to notice him excuse me for possibly interrupting you but it a matter of some importance $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ observed addressing the company generally
amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ i humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful attention to what i have to say to $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ $katerina_ivanovna$
$sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ $katerina_ivanovna$ he went on addressing $sonia$ who was very much surprised and already alarmed immediately after your visit i found that a hundred #rouble# note was missing from my table in the room of my #friend# mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$
if in any way whatever you know and will tell us where it is now i assure you on my word of honour and call all present to witness that the matter shall #end# there
in the opposite case i shall be compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then you must blame yourself
i am glad indeed to find other persons present complete silence reigned in the room even the crying #child# were still
$sonia$ stood deadly pale staring at $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and unable to say a word she seemed not to understand some seconds passed
well how is it to be then asked $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ looking intently at her i dont know i know nothing about it $sonia$ articulated faintly at last
no you know nothing $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ repeated and again he paused for some seconds think a moment mademoiselle he began severely but still as it were admonishing her
kindly observe this if i were not so entirely convinced i should not you may be sure with my #experience# venture to accuse you so directly
seeing that for such direct accusation before witnesses if false or even mistaken i should myself in a certain sense be made responsible i am aware of that
reflect i am prepared to give you time for consideration this morning i changed for my own purposes several five per cent securities for the sum of approximately three thousand #rouble#
on my return home i proceeded to count the money as mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ will bear witness and after counting two thousand three hundred #rouble# i put the rest in my #pocket# book in my coat #pocket#
the account is noted down in my #pocket# book about five hundred #rouble# remained on the table and among them three notes of a hundred #rouble# each
at that moment you entered at my invitation and all the time you were present you were exceedingly embarrassed so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the conversation and tried to make off
you yourself mademoiselle probably will not refuse to confirm my statement that i invited you through mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ solely in order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your relative $katerina_ivanovna$ whose dinner i was unable to attend and the advisability of getting up #something# of the nature of a subscription lottery or the like for her benefit
i describe all this as it took place primarily to recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest detail has escaped my recollection
then i took a ten #rouble# note from the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part for the benefit of your relative
then i accompanied you to the #door# you being still in the same state of embarrassment after which being left alone with mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ i talked to him for ten minutes
then mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ went out and i returned to the table with the money lying on it intending to count it and to put it aside as i proposed doing before
mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ can bear witness to this you thanked me and even shed tears mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ saw all this to my surprise one hundred #rouble# note had disappeared
kindly consider the position mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ i cannot suspect i am ashamed to allude to such a supposition i cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning for the minute before your entrance
you will admit that recollecting your embarrassment your eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your #hand# for some time on the table and taking into consideration your social position and the habits associated with it i was so to say with horror and positively against my will compelled to entertain a suspicion a cruel but justifiable suspicion
i will add further and repeat that in #spite# of my positive conviction i realise that i run a certain risk in making this accusation but as you see i could not let it pass
i had finished my accounts and found the total correct i have taken action and i will tell you why solely madam solely owing to your black ingratitude
i invite you for the benefit of your destitute relative i present you with my donation of ten #rouble# and you on the spot repay me for all that with such an action
moreover like a true #friend# i beg you and you could have no better #friend# at this moment think what you are doing otherwise i shall be immovable
why it is too bad you need a lesson reflect well what do you say i have taken nothing $sonia$ whispered in terror you gave me ten #rouble# here it is take it
$sonia$ pulled her handkerchief out of her #pocket# untied a #corner# of it took out the ten #rouble# note and gave it to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
and the hundred #rouble# you do not confess to taking he insisted reproachfully not taking the note $sonia$ looked about her
all were looking at her with such awful stern ironical hostile eyes she looked at $mr_raskolnikov$ he stood against the #wall# with his arms crossed looking at her with glowing eyes
amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ we shall have to send word to the police and therefore i humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter
good god broke from $sonia$ $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ said softly and even kindly gott der barmherzige i knew she was the thief cried amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ throwing up her #hand#
you knew it $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ caught her up then i suppose you had some reason before this for thinking so i beg you worthy amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ to remember your words which have been uttered before witnesses
there was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides all were in movement what cried $katerina_ivanovna$ suddenly realising the position and she rushed at $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
what you accuse her of stealing $sonia$ ah the wretches the wretches and running to $sonia$ she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as in a vise
$sonia$ how dared you take ten #rouble# from him foolish girl give it to me give me the ten #rouble# at once here
and snatching the note from $sonia$ $katerina_ivanovna$ crumpled it up and flung it straight into $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ face it hit him in the eye and fell on the ground
amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ hastened to pick it up $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ lost his #temper# hold that mad woman he shouted at that moment several other persons besides $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ appeared in the doorway among them the two ladies
what mad am i mad idiot shrieked $katerina_ivanovna$ you are an idiot yourself pettifogging lawyer base #man# $sonia$ sonia take his money
$sonia$ a thief why she give away her last penny and $katerina_ivanovna$ broke into hysterical laughter did you ever see such an idiot
she suddenly saw the landlady and you too sausage eater you declare that she is a thief you trashy prussian hen leg in a crinoline
she hasnt been out of this room she came straight from you you wretch and sat down beside me everyone saw her
she turned from side to side and you too she sat here by $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ search her since she not left the room the money would have to be on her
i ll go to our sovereign to our sovereign to our gracious tsar himself and throw myself at his feet to #day# this minute
search her search her but if you dont find it then excuse me my dear fellow you ll answer for it i am alone in the world
they would let me in do you think they wouldnt you re wrong i will get in i will get in you reckoned on her meekness
you relied upon that but i am not so submissive let me tell you you ve gone too far yourself search her search her
and $katerina_ivanovna$ in a frenzy shook $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and dragged him towards $sonia$ i am ready i ll be responsible but calm yourself madam calm yourself
well well but as to that $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ muttered that ought to be before the police though indeed there are witnesses enough as it is
i see that you are not so submissive i am ready but in any case it difficult for a #man# on account of her sex
but with the help of amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ though of course it not the way to do things how is it to be done
as you will let #anyone# who likes search her cried $katerina_ivanovna$ $sonia$ turn out your #pocket# see look monster the #pocket# is empty here was her handkerchief
but from the right #pocket# a piece of paper flew out and describing a parabola in the air fell at $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ feet
here is the other #pocket# look you see you see and $katerina_ivanovna$ turned or rather snatched both #pocket# inside out everyone saw it several cried out
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ stooped down picked up the paper in two fingers lifted it where all could see it and opened it
it was a hundred #rouble# note folded in eight $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ held up the note showing it to everyone thief out of my lodging
police police yelled amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ they must to siberia be sent away exclamations arose on all sides $mr_raskolnikov$ was silent keeping his eyes fixed on $sonia$ except for an occasional rapid glance at $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
$sonia$ stood still as though unconscious she was hardly able to feel surprise suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks she uttered a cry and hid her face in her #hand#
i know nothing about it she cried with a heartrending wail and she ran to $katerina_ivanovna$ who clasped her tightly in her arms as though she would shelter her from all the world
no it wasnt i i didnt take it $sonia$ sonia i dont believe it you see i dont believe it
she cried in the face of the obvious fact swaying her to and fro in her arms like a baby kissing her face continually then snatching at her #hand# and kissing them too you took it
you are fools fools she cried addressing the whole room you dont know you dont know what a heart she has what a girl she is
how stupid these people are oh dear she take it she she sell her last rag she go barefoot to help you if you needed it that what she is
she has the yellow passport because my #child# were starving she sold herself for us ah husband husband do you see
do you see what a memorial dinner for you merciful heavens defend her why are you all standing still $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ why dont you stand up for her
do you believe it too you are not worth her little finger all of you together good god defend her now at least
the agonised wasted consumptive face the parched blood stained lips the hoarse voice the tears unrestrained as a #child# the trustful childish and yet despairing prayer for help were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her
the wail of the poor consumptive helpless woman seemed to produce a great effect on her audience $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ at any rate was at once moved to compassion
he cried impressively no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an instigator or even an accomplice in it especially as you have proved her guilt by turning out her #pocket# showing that you had no previous idea of it
i am most ready most ready to show compassion if #poverty# so to speak drove $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ to it but why did you refuse to confess mademoiselle
madam madam this incident does not reflect upon you were you afraid of the disgrace the first #step# you lost your #head# perhaps
one can quite understand it but how could you have lowered yourself to such an action gentlemen he addressed the whole company gentlemen
compassionate and so to say commiserating these people i am ready to overlook it even now in #spite# of the personal insult lavished upon me
and may this disgrace be a lesson to you for the future he said addressing $sonia$ and i will carry the matter no further
enough $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ stole a glance at $mr_raskolnikov$ their eyes met and the fire in $mr_raskolnikov$ seemed ready to reduce him to ashes
the #child# too were embracing $sonia$ on all sides and $polenka$ though she did not fully understand what was wrong was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs as she hid her pretty little face swollen with weeping on $sonia$ shoulder
meanwhile $katerina_ivanovna$ apparently heard nothing she was kissing and hugging $sonia$ like a madwoman how vile a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ looked round quickly what vileness $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ repeated staring him straight in the face $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ gave a positive start all noticed it and recalled it afterwards
$andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ strode into the room and you dared to call me as witness he said going up to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
what do you mean what are you talking about muttered $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ i mean that you are a slanderer that what my words mean
$andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ said hotly looking sternly at him with his short sighted eyes he was extremely angry $mr_raskolnikov$ gazed intently at him as though seizing and weighing each word
again there was a silence $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment if you mean that for me he began stammering
but what the matter with you are you out of your mind i in my mind but you are a scoundrel
ah how vile i have heard everything i kept waiting on purpose to understand it for i must own even now
it is not quite logical what you have done it all for i cant understand why what have i done then
give over talking in your nonsensical riddles or maybe you are drunk you may be a drunkard perhaps vile #man# but i am not
i never touch vodka for it against my convictions would you believe it he he himself with his own #hand# gave $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ that hundred #rouble# note
i saw it i was a witness i ll take my oath he did it he repeated $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ addressing all are you crazy milksop squealed $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
she is herself before you she herself here declared just now before everyone that i gave her only ten #rouble# how could i have given it to her
i saw it i saw it $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ repeated and though it is against my principles i am ready this very minute to take any oath you like before the court for i saw how you slipped it in her #pocket#
when you were saying good bye to her at the #door# while you held her #hand# in one #hand# with the other the left you slipped the note into her #pocket#
only like a fool i #thought# you did it out of kindness i saw it i saw it $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ turned pale
what lies he cried impudently why how could you standing by the window see the note you fancied it with your short sighted eyes
you are raving no i didnt fancy it and though i was standing some way off i saw it all
and though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from the window that true i knew for certain that it was a hundred #rouble# note because when you were going to give $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ ten #rouble# you took up from the table a hundred #rouble# note i saw it because i was standing near then and an idea struck me at once so that i did not forget you had it in your #hand#
i didnt think of it again until when you were getting up you changed it from your right #hand# to your left and nearly dropped it
i noticed it because the same idea struck me again that you meant to do her a kindness without my seeing
you folded it and kept it in your #hand# all the time you can fancy how i watched you and i saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her #pocket#
i saw it i saw it i ll take my oath $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ was almost breathless exclamations arose on all #hand# chiefly expressive of wonder but some were menacing in tone
they all crowded round $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ $katerina_ivanovna$ flew to $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ i was mistaken in you protect her you are the only one to take her part
she is an orphan god has sent you $katerina_ivanovna$ hardly knowing what she was doing sank on her knees before him
a pack of nonsense yelled $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ roused to fury it all nonsense you ve been talking an idea struck you you didnt think you noticed what does it amount to
so i gave it to her on the sly on purpose what for with what object what have i to do with this
so far from my being mistaken you infamous criminal #man# i remember how on account of it a question occurred to me at once just when i was thanking you and pressing your #hand#
what for that what i cant understand but that what i am telling you is the fact that certain what made you put it secretly in her #pocket#
could it be simply to conceal it from me knowing that my convictions are opposed to yours and that i do not approve of private benevolence which effects no radical cure
why you did it secretly i mean well i decided that you really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me
perhaps too i #thought# he wants to give her a surprise when she finds a whole hundred #rouble# note in her #pocket#
then the idea struck me too that you wanted to test her to see whether when she found it she would come to thank you
then too that you wanted to avoid thanks and that as the saying is your right #hand# should not know #something# of that sort in fact
i #thought# of so many possibilities that i put off considering it but still #thought# it indelicate to show you that i knew your secret
but another idea struck me again that $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ might easily lose the money before she noticed it that was why i decided to come in here to call her out of the room and to tell her that you put a hundred #rouble# in her #pocket#
but on my way i went first to madame kobilatnikov to take them the general treatise on the positive method and especially to recommend piderit article and also
for i know some benevolent people are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way wagner then i come on here and what a state of things i find
now could i could i have all these ideas and reflections if i had not seen you put the hundred #rouble# note in her #pocket#
when $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ finished his long winded harangue with the logical deduction at the #end# he was quite tired and the perspiration streamed from his face
he could not alas even express himself correctly in russian though he knew no other language so that he was quite exhausted almost emaciated after this heroic exploit
but his speech produced a powerful effect he had spoken with such vehemence with such conviction that everyone obviously believed him
$pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ felt that things were going badly with him what is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you
he shouted that no evidence you may have dreamt it that all and i tell you you are lying sir
you are lying and slandering from some #spite# against me simply from pique because i did not agree with your free thinking godless social propositions
but this retort did not benefit $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ murmurs of disapproval were heard on all sides ah that your line now is it
cried $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ that nonsense call the police and i ll take my oath there only one thing i cant understand what made him risk such a contemptible action
i can explain why he risked such an action and if necessary i too will swear to it $mr_raskolnikov$ said at last in a firm voice and he stepped forward
everyone felt clearly from the very look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would be solved
oh pitiful despicable #man# he appeared to be firm and composed now i can explain it all to myself said $mr_raskolnikov$ addressing $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$
from the very beginning of the business i suspected that there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it
i began to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only which i will explain at once to everyone they account for everything
your valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me i beg all all to listen this gentleman he pointed to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ was recently engaged to be married to a young lady my sister $avdotya_romanovna$ $mr_raskolnikov$
but coming to petersburg he quarrelled with me the #day# before yesterday at our first meeting and i drove him out of my room i have two witnesses to prove it
the #day# before yesterday i did not know that he was staying here in your room and that consequently on the very #day# we quarrelled the #day# before yesterday he saw me give $katerina_ivanovna$ some money for the funeral as a #friend# of the late mr $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$
he at once wrote a note to my #mother# and informed her that i had given away all my money not to $katerina_ivanovna$ but to $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ and referred in a most contemptible way to the character of $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ that is hinted at the character of my attitude to $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$
all this you understand was with the object of dividing me from my #mother# and sister by insinuating that i was squandering on unworthy objects the money which they had sent me and which was all they had
yesterday #evening# before my #mother# and sister and in his presence i declared that i had given the money to $katerina_ivanovna$ for the funeral and not to $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ and that i had no acquaintance with $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ and had never seen her before indeed
at the same time i added that he $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ with all his virtues was not worth $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ little finger though he spoke so ill of her
to his question would i let $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ sit down beside my sister i answered that i had already done so that #day#
irritated that my #mother# and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations he gradually began being unpardonably rude to them
he is a very spiteful #man# a final rupture took place and he was turned out of the house all this happened yesterday #evening#
now i beg your special attention consider if he had now succeeded in proving that $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ was a thief he would have shown to my #mother# and sister that he was almost right in his suspicions that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on a level with $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ that in attacking me he was protecting and preserving the honour of my sister his betrothed
in fact he might even through all this have been able to estrange me from my family and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them to say nothing of revenging himself on me personally for he has grounds for supposing that the honour and happiness of $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ are very precious to me
that was what he was working for that how i understand it that the whole reason for it and there can be no other
it was like this or somewhat like this that $mr_raskolnikov$ wound up his speech which was followed very attentively though often interrupted by exclamations from his audience
but in #spite# of interruptions he spoke clearly calmly exactly firmly his decisive voice his tone of conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone
yes yes that it $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ assented gleefully that must be it for he asked me as soon as $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ came into our room whether you were here whether i had seen you among $katerina_ivanovna$ guests
he called me aside to the window and asked me in secret it was essential for him that you should be here
that it that it $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ smiled contemptuously and did not speak but he was very pale he seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape
perhaps he would have been glad to give up everything and get away but at the moment this was scarcely possible
it would have implied admitting the truth of the accusations brought against him moreover the company which had already been excited by drink was now too much stirred to allow it
the commissariat clerk though indeed he had not grasped the whole position was shouting louder than #anyone# and was making some suggestions very unpleasant to $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
the three poles were tremendously excited and were continually shouting at him the pan is a lajdak and muttering threats in polish
$sonia$ had been listening with strained attention though she too seemed unable to grasp it all she seemed as though she had just returned to consciousness
but not all those present were drunk lodgers came in from all the rooms she did not take her eyes off $mr_raskolnikov$ feeling that all her safety lay in him
$katerina_ivanovna$ breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ stood looking more stupid than #anyone# with her mouth wide open unable to make out what had happened
she only saw that $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ had somehow come to grief $mr_raskolnikov$ was attempting to speak again but they did not let him
everyone was crowding round $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ with threats and shouts of abuse but $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ was not intimidated seeing that his accusation of $sonia$ had completely failed he had recourse to insolence allow me gentlemen allow me
dont squeeze let me pass he said making his way through the crowd and no threats if you please
i assure you it will be useless you will gain nothing by it on the contrary you ll have to answer gentlemen for violently obstructing the course of justice
our judges are not so blind and not so drunk and will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels agitators and atheists who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are foolish enough to admit
the thief has been more than unmasked and i shall prosecute yes allow me to pass dont let me find a trace of you in my room
kindly leave at once and everything is at an #end# between us when i think of the trouble i ve been taking the way i ve been expounding all this fortnight
i told you myself to #day# that i was going when you tried to keep me now i will simply add that you are a fool
i advise you to see a doctor for your brains and your short sight let me pass gentlemen he forced his way through
but the commissariat clerk was unwilling to let him off so easily he picked up a glass from the table brandished it in the air and flung it at $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ but the glass flew straight at amalia $katerina_ivanovna$
she screamed and the clerk overbalancing fell heavily under the table $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ made his way to his room and half an hour later had left the house
$sonia$ timid by nature had felt before that #day# that she could be ill treated more easily than #anyone# and that she could be wronged with impunity
yet till that moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care gentleness and submissiveness before everyone her disappointment was too great
she could of course bear with patience and almost without murmur anything even this but for the first minute she felt it too bitter
in #spite# of her triumph and her justification when her first terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all clearly the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her
at last unable to bear any more she rushed out of the room and ran home almost immediately after $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ departure
made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical weeping when amidst loud laughter the glass flew at amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ it was more than the landlady could endure
with a shriek she rushed like a fury at $katerina_ivanovna$ considering her to blame for everything out of my lodgings
and with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay her #hand# on that belonged to $katerina_ivanovna$ and throwing it on the floor
$katerina_ivanovna$ pale almost fainting and gasping for breath jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at amalia $katerina_ivanovna$
at once quick march but the battle was too unequal the landlady waved her away like a feather what as though that godless calumny was not enough this vile creature attacks me
what on the #day# of my husband funeral i am turned out of my lodging after eating my bread and salt she turns me into the #street# with my orphans
where am i to go wailed the poor woman sobbing and gasping good god she cried with flashing eyes is there no justice upon earth
whom should you protect if not us orphans we shall see there is law and justice on earth there is i will find it
wait a bit godless creature $polenka$ stay with the #child# i ll come back wait for me if you have to wait in the #street#
and throwing over her #head# that green shawl which $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ had mentioned to $mr_raskolnikov$ $katerina_ivanovna$ squeezed her way through the disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room and wailing and tearful she ran into the #street# with a vague #intention# of going at once somewhere to find justice
$polenka$ with the two little ones in her arms crouched terrified on the trunk in the #corner# of the room where she waited trembling for her #mother# to come back
we will see whether there is justice on earth amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ raged about the room shrieking lamenting and throwing everything she came across on the floor
the lodgers talked incoherently some commented to the best of their ability on what had happened others quarrelled and swore at one another while others struck up a song
now it time for me to go #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$ well $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ we shall see what you ll say now
chapter iv $mr_raskolnikov$ had been a vigorous and active champion of $sonia$ against $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own heart
but having gone through so much in the morning he found a sort of relief in a change of sensations apart from the strong personal feeling which impelled him to defend $sonia$
he was agitated too especially at some moments by the #thought# of his approaching interview with $sonia$ he had to tell her who had killed $lizaveta_ivanovna$
and he set off in the direction of $sonia$ lodgings he knew the terrible suffering it would be to him and as it were brushed away the #thought# of it
so when he cried as he left $katerina_ivanovna$ well $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ we shall see what you ll say now he was still superficially excited still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$
but strange to say by the time he reached $sonia$ lodging he felt a sudden impotence and fear he stood still in #hesitation# at the #door# asking himself the strange question must he tell her who killed $lizaveta_ivanovna$
it was a strange question because he felt at the very time not only that he could not help telling her but also that he could not put off the telling
he did not yet know why it must be so he only felt it and the agonising sense of his impotence before the inevitable almost crushed him
she was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in her #hand# but seeing $mr_raskolnikov$ she got up at once and came to meet him as though she were expecting him
to cut short his #hesitation# and suffering he quickly opened the #door# and looked at $sonia$ from the doorway
what would have become of me but for you she said quickly meeting him in the middle of the room
evidently she was in haste to say this to him it was what she had been waiting for $mr_raskolnikov$ went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she had only just risen
he said and felt that his voice was trembling it was all due to your social position and the habits associated with it
she stood facing him two #step# away just as she had done the #day# before well $sonia$ did you understand that just now
her face showed her distress only dont talk to me as you did yesterday she interrupted him please dont begin it
there is #misery# enough without that she made haste to smile afraid that he might not like the reproach
i was silly to come away from there what is happening there now i wanted to go back directly but i kept thinking that you would come
he told her that amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ was turning them out of their lodging and that $katerina_ivanovna$ had run off somewhere to seek justice
my god cried $sonia$ let go at once and she snatched up her cape it everlastingly the same thing said $mr_raskolnikov$ irritably
you ve no #thought# except for them stay a little with me but $katerina_ivanovna$ you wont lose $katerina_ivanovna$ you may be sure
she ll come to you herself since she has run out he added peevishly if she doesnt find you here you ll be blamed for it
this time $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ did not want to prosecute you he began not looking at $sonia$ but if he had wanted to if it had suited his plans he would have sent you to prison if it had not been for $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ and me
$sonia$ sat down in painful suspense $mr_raskolnikov$ was silent gazing at the floor and deliberating ah yes she assented in a faint voice
yes she repeated preoccupied and distressed but i might easily not have been there and it was quite an accident
$andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ turning up $sonia$ was silent and if you gone to prison what then do you remember what i said yesterday
again she did not answer he waited i #thought# you would cry out again dont speak of it leave off
$mr_raskolnikov$ gave a laugh but rather a forced one what silence again he asked a minute later
we must talk about #something# you know it would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a certain problem as $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ would say
he was beginning to lose the thread no really i am serious imagine $sonia$ that you had known all $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ #intention# beforehand
known that is for a fact that they would be the ruin of $katerina_ivanovna$ and the #child# and yourself thrown in since you dont count yourself for anything
well if suddenly it all depended on your decision whether he or they should go on living that is whether $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ should go on living and doing wicked things or $katerina_ivanovna$ should die
$polenka$ too for she ll go the same way how would you decide which of them was to die i ask you
$sonia$ looked uneasily at him there was #something# peculiar in this hesitating question which seemed approaching #something# in a roundabout way
i felt that you were going to ask some question like that she said looking inquisitively at him i dare say you did
but how is it to be answered why do you ask about what could not happen said $sonia$ reluctantly then it would be better for $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ to go on living and doing wicked things
you havent dared to decide even that but i cant know the divine providence and why do you ask what cant be answered
how could it happen that it should depend on my decision who has made me a judge to decide who is to live and who is not to live
what the use of such foolish questions oh if the divine providence is to be mixed up in it there is no doing anything $mr_raskolnikov$ grumbled morosely
you better say straight out what you want $sonia$ cried in distress you are leading up to #something# again
can you have come simply to torture me she could not control herself and began crying bitterly he looked at her in gloomy #misery#
five minutes passed of course you re right $sonia$ he said softly at last he was suddenly changed his tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone
i told you yesterday that i was not coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing i ve said is to ask forgiveness
even his voice was suddenly weak i said that about $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and providence for my own sake i was asking forgiveness $sonia$
he tried to smile but there was #something# helpless and incomplete in his pale smile he bowed his #head# and hid his face in his #hand#
as it were wondering and frightened of this sensation he raised his #head# and looked intently at her but he met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him
and suddenly a strange surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred for $sonia$ passed through his heart there was love in them his hatred vanished like a phantom
it was not the real feeling he had taken the one feeling for the other it only meant that that minute had come
suddenly he turned pale got up from his chair looked at $sonia$ and without uttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed
his sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had stood over the old woman with the axe in his #hand# and felt that he must not lose another minute
he hid his face in his #hand# again and bowed his #head# what the matter asked $sonia$ dreadfully frightened
this was not at all not at all the way he had intended to tell and he did not understand what was happening to him now
she went up to him softly sat down on the bed beside him and waited not taking her eyes off him
he could not utter a word her heart throbbed and sank it was unendurable he turned his deadly pale face to her
his lips worked helplessly struggling to utter #something# a pang of terror passed through $sonia$ heart what the matter
she repeated drawing a little away from him nothing $sonia$ dont be frightened it nonsense it really is nonsense if you think of it he muttered like a #man# in delirium
why have i come to torture you he added suddenly looking at her why really i keep asking myself that question $sonia$
he had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour before but now he spoke helplessly hardly knowing what he said and feeling a continual tremor all over
oh how you are suffering she muttered in distress looking intently at him it all nonsense listen $sonia$
he suddenly smiled a pale helpless smile for two seconds you remember what i meant to tell you yesterday
i said as i went away that perhaps i was saying good bye for ever but that if i came to #day# i would tell you who who killed $lizaveta_ivanovna$
$sonia$ waited uneasily she began trembling all over well here i ve come to tell you then you really meant it yesterday
she whispered with difficulty how do you know she asked quickly as though suddenly regaining her reason $sonia$ face grew paler and paler and she breathed painfully
i know she paused a minute have they found him she asked timidly no then how do you know about it
she asked again hardly audibly and again after a minute pause he turned to her and looked very intently at her
guess he said with the same distorted helpless smile a shudder passed over her but you why do you frighten me like this
i must be a great #friend# of his since i know $mr_raskolnikov$ went on still gazing into her face as though he could not turn his eyes away
she said smiling like a #child# he did not mean to kill that $lizaveta_ivanovna$ he killed her accidentally
he meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and he went there and then $lizaveta_ivanovna$ came in he killed her too
another awful moment passed both still gazed at one another you cant guess then he asked suddenly feeling as though he were flinging himself down from a steeple
no whispered $sonia$ take a good look as soon as he had said this again the same familiar sensation froze his heart
he remembered clearly the expression in $lizaveta_ivanovna$ face when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the #wall# putting out her #hand# with childish terror in her face looking as little #child# do when they begin to be frightened of #something# looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them shrinking back and holding out their little #hand# on the #point# of crying
he looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the face of $lizaveta_ivanovna$ almost the same thing happened now to $sonia$
with the same helplessness and the same terror she looked at him for a while and suddenly putting out her left #hand# pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to get up from the bed moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed even more immovably on him
her terror infected him the same fear showed itself on his face in the same way he stared at her and almost with the same childish smile
have you guessed he whispered at last good god broke in an awful wail from her bosom
she sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows but a moment later she got up moved quickly to him seized both his #hand# and gripping them tight in her thin fingers began looking into his face again with the same intent stare
in this last desperate look she tried to look into him and catch some last #hope# but there was no #hope# there was no doubt remaining it was all true
later on indeed when she recalled that moment she #thought# it strange and wondered why she had seen at once that there was no doubt
she could not have said for instance that she had foreseen #something# of the sort and yet now as soon as he told her she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen this very thing
it was not at all not at all like this he had #thought# of telling her but this is how it happened
she jumped up seeming not to know what she was doing and wringing her #hand# walked into the middle of the room but quickly went back and sat down again beside him her shoulder almost touching his
as though she had been stabbed uttered a cry and fell on her knees before him she did not know why
stop $sonia$ enough dont torture me he begged her miserably all of a sudden she started what have you done what have you done to yourself
she said in despair and jumping up she flung herself on his neck threw her arms round him and held him tightly
$mr_raskolnikov$ drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile you are a strange girl $sonia$ you kiss me and hug me when i tell you about that
you dont think what you are doing there is no one no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you
she cried in a frenzy not hearing what he said and she suddenly broke into violent hysterical weeping a feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at once
he did not struggle against it two tears started into his eyes and hung on his eyelashes then you wont leave me $sonia$
he said looking at her almost with #hope# no no never nowhere cried $sonia$ i will follow you i will follow you everywhere
oh my god oh how miserable i am why why didnt i know you before why didnt you come before oh dear
here i have come yes now what to be done now together together she repeated as it were unconsciously and she hugged him again
i ll follow you to siberia he recoiled at this and the same hostile almost haughty smile came to his lips
perhaps i dont want to go to siberia yet $sonia$ he said $sonia$ looked at him quickly again after her first passionate agonising sympathy for the unhappy #man# the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her
in his changed tone she seemed to hear the murderer speaking she looked at him bewildered she knew nothing as yet why how with what object it had been
now all these questions rushed at once into her mind and again she could not believe it he he is a murderer
could it be true what the meaning of it where am i she said in complete bewilderment as though still unable to recover herself
how could you you a #man# like you how could you bring yourself to it what does it mean
oh well to plunder leave off $sonia$ he answered wearily almost with vexation $sonia$ stood as though struck dumb but suddenly she cried you were hungry
it was to help your #mother# yes no $sonia$ no he muttered turning away and hanging his #head# i was not so hungry
i certainly did want to help my #mother# but that not the real thing either dont torture me $sonia$ sonia clasped her #hand#
could it could it all be true good god what a truth who could believe it and how could you give away your last farthing and yet rob and murder
ah she cried suddenly that money you gave $katerina_ivanovna$ that money can that money no $sonia$ he broke in hurriedly that money was not it
dont worry yourself that money my #mother# sent me and it came when i was ill the #day# i gave it to you
$mr_razumihin$ saw it he received it for me that money was mine my own $sonia$ listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend
and that money i dont even know really whether there was any money he added softly as though reflecting
i took a purse off her neck made of chamois leather a purse stuffed full of #something# but i didnt look in it
and the things chains and trinkets i buried under a stone with the purse next morning in a yard off the prospect
i suppose i hadnt time they are all there now $sonia$ strained every nerve to listen then why why you said you did it to rob but you took nothing
i havent yet decided whether to take that money or not he said musing again and seeming to wake up with a start he gave a brief ironical smile
she asked quickly catching at a straw i dont know ach what silly stuff i am talking eh
the #thought# flashed through $sonia$ mind wasnt he mad but she dismissed it at once no it was #something# else
do you know $sonia$ he said suddenly with conviction let me tell you if i simply killed because i was hungry laying stress on every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her i should be happy now
what would it matter to you he cried a moment later with a sort of despair what would it matter to you if i were to confess that i did wrong
she could make nothing of it nothing you must believe that what do you gain by such a stupid triumph over me
ah $sonia$ was it for that i ve come to you to #day# again $sonia$ tried to say #something# but did not speak
i asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all i have left go where asked $sonia$ timidly
and you know $sonia$ it only now only this moment that i understand where i asked you to go with me yesterday
not to steal and not to murder dont be anxious he smiled bitterly we are so different yesterday when i said it i did not know where
i asked you for one thing i came to you for one thing not to leave me you wont leave me $sonia$
she squeezed his #hand# and why why did i tell her why did i let her know he cried a minute later in despair looking with infinite anguish at her
here you expect an explanation from me $sonia$ you are sitting and waiting for it i see that but what can i tell you
you wont understand and will only suffer #misery# on my account well you are crying and embracing me again why do you do it
because i couldnt bear my burden and have come to throw it on another you suffer too and i shall feel better
and can you love such a mean wretch but arent you suffering too cried $sonia$ again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart and again for an instant softened it
$sonia$ i have a bad heart take note of that it may explain a great deal i have come because i am bad
there are #man# who wouldnt have come but i am a coward and a mean wretch but never mind that not the #point#
i must speak now but i dont know how to begin he paused and sank into #thought# ach we are so different he cried again we are not alike
and why why did i come i shall never forgive myself that no no it was a good thing you came cried $sonia$
it better i should know far better he looked at her with anguish what if it were really that
he said as though reaching a conclusion yes that what it was i wanted to become a $napoleon$ that is why i killed her
do you understand now no $sonia$ whispered naïvely and timidly only speak speak i shall understand i shall understand in myself
she kept begging him you ll understand very well we shall see he paused and was for some time lost in meditation
it was like this i asked myself one #day# this question what if $napoleon$ for instance had happened to be in my place and if he had not had toulon nor egypt nor the passage of mont blanc to begin his career with but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things there had simply been some ridiculous old hag a pawnbroker who had to be murdered too to get money from her trunk for his career you understand
well would he have brought himself to that if there had been no other means wouldnt he have felt a pang at its being so far from monumental
well i must tell you that i worried myself fearfully over that question so that i was awfully ashamed when i guessed at last all of a sudden somehow that it would not have given him the least pang that it would not even have struck him that it was not monumental that he would not have seen that there was anything in it to pause over and that if he had had no other way he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it
and and sinful too well i too left off thinking about it murdered her following his example and that exactly how it was
do you think it funny yes $sonia$ the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that just how it was
$sonia$ did not think it at all funny you had better tell me straight out without examples she begged still more timidly and scarcely audibly
he turned to her looked sadly at her and took her #hand# you are right again $sonia$ of course that all nonsense
you see you know of course that my #mother# has scarcely anything my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned to drudge as a governess
i was a student but i couldnt keep myself at the university and was forced for a time to leave it
even if i had lingered on like that in ten or twelve years i might with luck #hope# to be some sort of teacher or clerk with a salary of a thousand #rouble#
he repeated it as though it were a lesson and by that time my #mother# would be worn out with grief and anxiety
it almost all talk all their #hope# were centered on me and i could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my sister
and it a hard thing to pass everything by all one life to turn one back upon everything to forget one #mother# and decorously accept the insults inflicted on one sister
well my sister might well have fared worse why should one when one has buried them to burden oneself with others wife and #child# and to leave them again without a farthing
so i resolved to gain possession of the old woman money and to use it for my first years without worrying my #mother# to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving it and to do this all on a broad thorough scale so as to build up a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence
well that all well of course in killing the old woman i did wrong well that enough he struggled to the #end# of his speech in exhaustion and let his #head# sink
oh that not it that not it $sonia$ cried in distress how could one no that not right not right
you see yourself that it not right but i ve spoken truly it the truth as though that could be the truth
good god i ve only killed a louse $sonia$ a useless loathsome harmful creature a human being a louse i too know it wasnt a louse he answered looking strangely at her
but i am talking nonsense $sonia$ he added i ve been talking nonsense a long time that not it you are right there
there were quite quite other causes for it i havent talked to #anyone# for so long $sonia$ my #head# aches dreadfully now
his eyes shone with feverish brilliance he was almost delirious an uneasy smile strayed on his lips his terrible exhaustion could be seen through his excitement
$sonia$ saw how he was suffering she too was growing dizzy and he talked so strangely it seemed somehow comprehensible but yet
no $sonia$ that not it he began again suddenly raising his #head# as though a new and sudden train of #thought# had struck and as it were roused
but how how good god and she wrung her #hand# in despair him that not it better imagine yes it certainly better
imagine that i am vain envious malicious base vindictive and well perhaps with a tendency to insanity let have it all out at once
they ve talked of madness already i noticed i told you just now i could not keep myself at the university but do you know that perhaps i might have done
my #mother# would have sent me what i needed for the fees and i could have earned enough for clothes boots and food no doubt
lessons had turned up at half a #rouble# $mr_razumihin$ works but i turned sulky and wouldnt yes sulkiness that the right word for it
i sat in my room like a spider you ve been in my den you ve seen it and do you know $sonia$ that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp the soul and the mind
ah how i hated that #garret# and yet i wouldnt go out of it i wouldnt on purpose i didnt go out for #day# together and i wouldnt work
if $nastasya$ brought me anything i ate it if she didnt i went all #day# without i wouldnt ask on purpose from sulkiness
i wouldnt even eat i just lay there doing nothing at night i had no light i lay in the dark and i wouldnt earn money for candles
i ought to have studied but i sold my books and the dust lies thinking and i kept thinking and i had dreams
all the time strange dreams of all sorts no need to describe only then i began to fancy that no that not it
again i am telling you wrong you see i kept asking myself then why am i so stupid that if others are stupid and i know they are yet i wont be wiser
afterwards i understood that that would never come to pass that #man# wont change and that nobody can alter it and that it not worth wasting effort over it
then i saw $sonia$ that if one waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long yes that so
that the law of their nature $sonia$ that so and i know now $sonia$ that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will have power over them
he who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he who dares most of all will be most in the right
#anyone# who is greatly daring is right in their eyes so it has been till now and so it will always be
a #man# must be blind not to see it though $mr_raskolnikov$ looked at $sonia$ as he said this he no longer cared whether she understood or not
the fever had complete hold of him he was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy he certainly had been too long without talking to #anyone#
i divined then $sonia$ he went on eagerly that power is only vouchsafed to the #man# who dares to stoop and pick it up
$sonia$ felt that his gloomy creed had become his faith and code there is only one thing one thing needful one has only to dare
then for the first time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever #thought# of before me no one
i saw clear as daylight how strange it is that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil
i i wanted to have the daring and i killed her i only wanted to have the daring $sonia$ that was the whole cause of it
oh hush hush cried $sonia$ clasping her #hand# you turned away from god and god has smitten you has given you over to the devil
then $sonia$ when i used to lie there in the dark and all this became clear to me was it a temptation of the devil eh
hush dont laugh blasphemer you dont understand you dont understand oh god he wont understand hush $sonia$ i am not laughing
i know it all i have #thought# it all over and over and whispered it all over to myself lying there in the dark
i know myself that it was the devil leading me hush $sonia$ hush he repeated with gloomy insistence i ve argued it all over with myself every #point# of it and i know it all all
and how sick how sick i was then of going over it all i have kept wanting to forget it and make a new beginning $sonia$ and leave off thinking
and you dont suppose that i went into it headlong like a fool i went into it like a wise #man# and that was just my destruction
and you mustnt suppose that i didnt know for instance that if i began to question myself whether i had the right to gain power i certainly hadnt the right or that if i asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasnt so for me though it might be for a #man# who would go straight to his goal without asking questions
if i worried myself all those #day# wondering whether $napoleon$ would have done it or not i felt clearly of course that i wasnt $napoleon$
i had to endure all the #agony# of that battle of ideas $sonia$ and i longed to throw it off i wanted to murder without casuistry to murder for my own sake for myself alone
i didnt want to lie about it even to myself it wasnt to help my #mother# i did the murder that nonsense i didnt do the murder to gain wealth and power and to become a benefactor of mankind
i simply did it i did the murder for myself for myself alone and whether i became a benefactor to others or spent my life like a spider catching #man# in my web and sucking the life out of #man# i couldnt have cared at that moment
nonsense and it was not the money i wanted $sonia$ when i did it it was not so much the money i wanted but #something# else
i know it all now understand me perhaps i should never have committed a murder again i wanted to find out #something# else it was #something# else led me on
whether i can #step# over barriers or not whether i dare stoop to pick up or not whether i am a trembling creature or whether i have the right
i wanted to find out then and quickly whether i was a louse like everybody else or a #man#
to kill have the right to kill $sonia$ clasped her #hand# ach $sonia$ he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort but was contemptuously silent
i want to prove one thing only that the devil led me on then and he has shown me since that i had not the right to take that path because i am just such a louse as all the rest
dont interrupt me $sonia$ he was mocking me and here i ve come to you now welcome your guest if i were not a louse should i have come to you
listen when i went then to the old woman i only went to try you may be sure of that
and you murdered her but how did i murder her is that how #man# do murders do #man# go to commit a murder as i went then
i will tell you some #day# how i went did i murder the old woman i murdered myself not her i crushed myself once for all for ever
but it was the devil that killed that old woman not i enough enough $sonia$ enough let me be he cried in a sudden spasm of #agony# let me be
he leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his #head# in his #hand# as in a vise what suffering
a wail of anguish broke from $sonia$ well what am i to do now he asked suddenly raising his #head# and looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair
what are you to do she cried jumping up and her eyes that had been full of tears suddenly began to shine
go at once this very minute stand at the cross roads bow down first kiss the earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say to all #man# aloud i am a murderer
stand up she seized him by the shoulder he got up looking at her almost bewildered then god will send you life again
she asked him trembling all over snatching his two #hand# squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes full of fire
will you go will you go he was amazed at her sudden ecstasy you mean siberia $sonia$ i must give myself up
he asked gloomily suffer and expiate your sin by it that what you must do no i am not going to them $sonia$
but how will you go on living what will you live for cried $sonia$ how is it possible now
why how can you talk to your #mother# oh what will become of them now but what am i saying you have abandoned your #mother# and your sister already
he has abandoned them already oh god she cried why he knows it all himself how how can he live by himself
what will become of you now dont be a #child# $sonia$ he said softly what wrong have i done them
why should i go to them what should i say to them that only a phantom they destroy #man# by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue
and what should i say to them that i murdered her but did not dare to take the money and hid it under a stone
they are knaves and scoundrels $sonia$ i am not going to them he added with a bitter smile why they would laugh at me and would call me a fool for not getting it
a coward and a fool they wouldnt understand and they dont deserve to understand why should i go to them i wont
dont be a #child# $sonia$ it will be too much for you to bear too much she repeated holding out her #hand# in despairing supplication
perhaps i ve been unfair to myself he observed gloomily pondering perhaps after all i am a #man# and not a louse
and i ve been in too great a hurry to condemn myself i ll make another fight for it a haughty smile appeared on his lips
what a burden to bear and your whole life your whole life i shall get used to it he said grimly and thoughtfully
listen he began a minute later stop crying it time to talk of the facts i ve come to tell you that the police are after me on my track
ach $sonia$ cried in terror well why do you cry out you want me to go to siberia and now you are frightened
but let me tell you i shall not give myself up i shall make a struggle for it and they wont do anything to me
they ve no real evidence yesterday i was in great danger and believed i was lost but to #day# things are going better
all the facts they know can be explained two ways that to say i can turn their accusations to my credit do you understand
if it had not been for #something# that happened they would have done so to #day# for certain perhaps even now they will arrest me to #day#
and i shall for i ve learnt my lesson but they will certainly arrest me but that no matter $sonia$ they ll let me out again
for there isnt any real proof against me and there wont be i give you my word for it and they cant convict a #man# on what they have against me
enough i only tell you that you may know i will try to manage somehow to put it to my #mother# and sister so that they wont be frightened
my sister future is secure however now i believe and my #mother# must be too well that all be careful though
they sat side by side both mournful and dejected as though they had been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore
he looked at $sonia$ and felt how great was her love for him and strange to say he felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved
will you come and see me in prison when i am there oh i will i will yes it was a strange and awful sensation
on his way to see $sonia$ he had felt that all his #hope# rested on her he expected to be rid of at least part of his suffering and now when all her heart turned towards him he suddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before
$sonia$ he said you better not come and see me when i am in prison $sonia$ did not answer she was crying
several minutes passed have you a cross on you she asked as though suddenly thinking of it he did not at first understand the question
no of course not here take this one of cypress wood i have another a copper one that belonged to $lizaveta_ivanovna$
i changed with $lizaveta_ivanovna$ she gave me her cross and i gave her my little ikon i will wear $lizaveta_ivanovna$ now and give you this
take it it mine it mine you know she begged him we will go to suffer together and together we will bear our cross
give it me said $mr_raskolnikov$ he did not want to hurt her feelings but immediately he drew back the #hand# he held out for the cross
not now $sonia$ better later he added to comfort her yes yes better she repeated with conviction when you go to meet your suffering then put it on
you will come to me i ll put it on you we will pray and go together at that moment someone knocked three times at the #door#
$sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ may i come in they heard in a very familiar and polite voice $sonia$ rushed to the #door# in a fright
the flaxen #head# of mr $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ appeared at the #door# chapter $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ looked perturbed i ve come to you $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ he began
excuse me i #thought# i should find you he said addressing $mr_raskolnikov$ suddenly that is i didnt mean anything of that sort
but i just #thought# $katerina_ivanovna$ has gone out of her mind he blurted out suddenly turning from $mr_raskolnikov$ to $sonia$
$sonia$ screamed at least it seems so but we dont know what to do you see she came back she seems to have been turned out somewhere perhaps beaten
she had run to your father former chief she didnt find him at home he was dining at some other general
she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to see her had him fetched out from dinner it seems
so it seems at least only fancy she rushed off there to the other general and imagine you can imagine what happened
she was turned out of course but according to her own #story# she abused him and threw #something# at him one may well believe it
now she is telling everyone including amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ but it difficult to understand her she is screaming and flinging herself about
oh yes she shouts that since everyone has abandoned her she will take the #child# and go into the #street# with a barrel organ and the #child# will sing and dance and she too and collect money and will go every #day# under the general window to let everyone see well born #child# whose father was an official begging in the #street#
how it is she wasnt taken up i cant understand she keeps beating the #child# and they are all crying she is teaching lida to sing my village the boy to dance $polenka$ the same
she is tearing up all the clothes and making them little caps like actors she means to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle instead of music
$andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ would have gone on but $sonia$ who had heard him almost breathless snatched up her cloak and hat and ran out of the room putting on her things as she went
she wont listen to anything imagine the state of things it beyond anything $mr_raskolnikov$ followed her and $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ came after him
i didnt want to frighten $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ so i said it seemed like it but there isnt a doubt of it
she has certainly gone mad he said to $mr_raskolnikov$ as they went out into the #street# they say that in consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain it a pity i know nothing of medicine
i did try to persuade her but she wouldnt listen did you talk to her about the tubercles not precisely of the tubercles
but what i say is that if you convince a person logically that he has nothing to cry about he ll stop crying
besides she wouldnt have understood that clear is it your conviction that he wont life would be too easy if it were so answered $mr_raskolnikov$
excuse me excuse me of course it would be rather difficult for $katerina_ivanovna$ to understand but do you know that in paris they have been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the insane simply by logical argument
his idea was that there nothing really wrong with the physical organism of the insane and that insanity is so to say a logical mistake an error of judgment an incorrect view of things
one professor there a scientific #man# of standing lately dead believed in the possibility of such treatment he gradually showed the madman his error and would you believe it they say he was successful
but as he made use of douches too how far success was due to that treatment remains uncertain so it seems at least
$mr_raskolnikov$ had long ceased to listen reaching the house where he lived he nodded to $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ and went in at the gate
$andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ woke up with a start looked about him and hurried on $mr_raskolnikov$ went into his little room and stood still in the middle of it
why had he come back here he looked at the yellow and tattered paper at the dust at his sofa from the yard came a loud continuous knocking someone seemed to be hammering
he went to the window rose on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of absorbed attention
but the yard was empty and he could not see who was hammering in the house on the left he saw some open windows on the window sills were pots of sickly looking geraniums
linen was hung out of the windows he knew it all by heart he turned away and sat down on the sofa
yes he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate $sonia$ now that he had made her more miserable
never never had he felt himself so fearfully alone why had he gone to her to beg for her tears
what need had he to poison her life oh the meanness of it i will remain alone he said resolutely and she shall not come to the prison
five minutes later he raised his #head# with a strange smile that was a strange #thought# perhaps it really would be better in siberia he #thought# suddenly
he could not have said how long he sat there with vague #thought# surging through his mind all at once the #door# opened and $dounia$ came in
at first she stood still and looked at him from the doorway just as he had done at $sonia$ then she came in and sat down in the same place as yesterday on the chair facing him
he looked silently and almost vacantly at her dont be angry brother i ve only come for one minute said $dounia$
her face looked thoughtful but not stern her eyes were bright and soft he saw that she too had come to him with love
brother now i know all all $dmitri_prokofitch$ has explained and told me everything they are worrying and persecuting you through a stupid and contemptible suspicion
$dmitri_prokofitch$ told me that there is no danger and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such horror
i dont think so and i fully understand how indignant you must be and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you
as for your cutting yourself off from us i dont judge you i dont venture to judge you and forgive me for having blamed you for it
that what i am afraid of i feel that i too if i had so great a trouble should keep away from everyone
i shall tell #mother# nothing of this but i shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that you will come very soon
dont worry about her i will set her mind at rest but dont you try her too much come once at least remember that she is your #mother#
and now i have come simply to say $dounia$ began to get up that if you should need me or should need all my life or anything call me and i ll come
good bye she turned abruptly and went towards the #door# $dounia$ $mr_raskolnikov$ stopped her and went towards her that $mr_razumihin$ $dmitri_prokofitch$ is a very good fellow
$dounia$ flushed slightly well she asked waiting a moment he is competent hardworking honest and capable of real love
good bye $dounia$ dounia flushed crimson then suddenly she took alarm but what does it mean brother are we really parting for ever that you give me such a parting message
never mind good bye he turned away and walked to the window she stood a moment looked at him uneasily and went out troubled
there was an instant the very last one when he had longed to take her in his arms and say good bye to her and even to tell her but he had not dared even to touch her #hand#
no he was not cold to her afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that i embraced her and will feel that i stole her kiss
and would she stand that test he went on a few minutes later to himself no she wouldnt girls like that cant stand things
they never do and he #thought# of $sonia$ there was a breath of fresh air from the window the daylight was fading
he took up his cap and went out he could not of course and would not consider how ill he was
and if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession of his faculties
but all this continual anxiety and #agony# of mind could not but affect him but this artificial excitement could not last long
there was nothing poignant nothing acute about it but there was a feeling of permanence of eternity about it it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden #misery# a foretaste of an eternity on a square yard of space
he wandered aimlessly the sun was setting a special form of #misery# had begun to oppress him of late towards #evening# this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily
with this idiotic purely physical weakness depending on the sunset or #something# one cant help doing #something# stupid you ll go to $dounia$ as well as to $sonia$ he muttered bitterly
he heard his name called he looked round $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ rushed up to him only fancy i ve been to your room looking for you
only fancy she carried out her plan and taken away the #child# $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ and i have had a job to find them
she is rapping on a frying pan and making the #child# dance the #child# are crying they keep stopping at the cross roads and in front of shops there a crowd of fools running after them
come along and $sonia$ $mr_raskolnikov$ asked anxiously hurrying after $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ simply frantic that is it not $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ frantic but $katerina_ivanovna$ though $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ semyonova frantic too
but $katerina_ivanovna$ is absolutely frantic i tell you she is quite mad they ll be taken to the police you can fancy what an effect that will have
on the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one where $sonia$ lodged there was a crowd of people consisting principally of gutter #child#
the hoarse broken voice of $katerina_ivanovna$ could be heard from the bridge and it certainly was a strange spectacle likely to attract a #street# crowd
$katerina_ivanovna$ in her old dress with the green shawl wearing a torn straw hat crushed in a hideous way on one side was really frantic
they are on the canal bank near the bridge now not far from $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ quite close she was exhausted and breathless
her wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever and indeed out of #door# in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home
she rushed at the #child# shouted at them coaxed them told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing began explaining to them why it was necessary and driven to desperation by their not understanding beat them
then she would make a rush at the crowd if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look she immediately appealed to him to see what these #child# from a genteel one may say aristocratic house had been brought to
if she heard laughter or jeering in the crowd she would rush at once at the scoffers and begin squabbling with them
some people laughed others shook their #head# but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the frightened #child#
but her excitement did not flag and every moment her irritation grew more intense the frying pan of which $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ had spoken was not there at least $mr_raskolnikov$ did not see it
but instead of rapping on the pan $katerina_ivanovna$ began clapping her wasted #hand# when she made lida and $kolya$ dance and $polenka$ sing
she too joined in the singing but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough which made her curse in despair and even shed tears
what made her most furious was the weeping and terror of $kolya$ and lida some effort had been made to dress the #child# up as #street# singers are dressed
there had been no costume for lida she simply had a red knitted cap or rather a night cap that had belonged to $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ decorated with a broken piece of white ostrich feather which had been $katerina_ivanovna$ grandmother and had been preserved as a family possession
$polenka$ was in her everyday dress she looked in timid perplexity at her #mother# and kept at her side hiding her tears
the boy had on a turban made of #something# red and white to look like a turk she dimly realised her #mother# condition and looked uneasily about her
she was terribly frightened of the #street# and the crowd $sonia$ followed $katerina_ivanovna$ weeping and beseeching her to return home but $katerina_ivanovna$ was not to be persuaded
leave off $sonia$ leave off she shouted speaking fast panting and coughing you dont know what you ask you are like a #child#
let everyone let all petersburg see the #child# begging in the #street# though their father was an honourable #man# who served all his life in truth and fidelity and one may say died in the service

goodness what am i to do with them $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ if you only knew how stupid they are what one to do with such #child#
$mr_raskolnikov$ tried to persuade her to go home and even said hoping to work on her vanity that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the #street# like an organ grinder as she was intending to become the principal of a boarding school
and she almost crying herself which did not stop her uninterrupted rapid flow of talk pointed to the crying #child# a boarding school ha ha ha
a castle in the air cried $katerina_ivanovna$ her laugh ending in a cough no $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ that dream is over
all have forsaken us and that general you know $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ i threw an inkpot at him it happened to be standing in the waiting room by the paper where you sign your name
i wrote my name threw it at him and ran away oh the scoundrels the scoundrels but enough of them now i ll provide for the #child# myself i wont bow down to anybody
she has had to bear enough for us she pointed to $sonia$ $polenka$ how much have you got show me
what only two farthings oh the mean wretches they give us nothing only run after us putting their tongues out there what is that blockhead laughing at
she pointed to a #man# in the crowd it all because $kolya$ here is so stupid i have such a bother with him

what do you want $polenka$ tell me in french parlez moi français why i ve taught you you know some phrases we arent going to have a punch and judy show in the #street# but to sing a genteel song
you keep putting me out but we you see we are standing here $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ to find #something# to sing and get money #something# $kolya$ can dance to
we must talk it over and rehearse it all thoroughly and then we shall go to nevsky where there are far more people of good society and we shall be noticed at once
ah yes what are we to sing for as you can fancy our performance is all impromptu lida knows my village only nothing but
my village and everyone sings that we must sing #something# far more genteel well have you #thought# of anything $polenka$ if only you help your #mother#
my memory quite gone or i should have #thought# of #something# we really cant sing an hussar ah let us sing in french cinq sous i have taught it you i have taught it you
and as it is in french people will see at once that you are #child# of good family and that will be much more touching
you might sing marlborough en vat en guerre for that quite a #child# song and is sung as a lullaby in all the aristocratic houses
marlborough en vat en guerre ne sait quand reviendra she began singing but no better sing cinq sous
now $kolya$ your #hand# on your hips make haste and you lida keep turning the other way and $polenka$ and i will sing and clap our #hand#
cinq sous cinq sous pour monter notre menage cough cough cough set your dress straight $polenka$ it slipped down on your shoulders she observed panting from coughing
now it particularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly that all may see that you are well born #child# i said at the time that the bodice should be cut longer and made of two widths
it was your fault $sonia$ with your advice to make it shorter and now you see the #child# is quite deformed by it
why you re all crying again what the matter stupids come $kolya$ begin make haste make haste oh what an unbearable #child#
cinq sous cinq sous a policeman again what do you want a policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd
but at that moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat a solid looking official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck which delighted $katerina_ivanovna$ and had its effect on the policeman approached and without a word handed her a green three #rouble# note
his face wore a look of genuine sympathy $katerina_ivanovna$ took it and gave him a polite even ceremonious bow
the causes that have induced us take the money $polenka$ you see there are generous and honourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress
you see honoured sir these orphans of good family i might even say of aristocratic connections and that wretch of a general sat eating grouse and stamped at my disturbing him
your excellency i said protect the orphans for you knew my late husband $semyon_zaharovitch$ and on the very #day# of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his only daughter
i thank you honoured sir she began loftily that policeman again protect me she cried to the official why is that policeman edging up to me
we have only just run away from one of them what do you want fool it forbidden in the #street#
you mustnt make a disturbance it you re making a disturbance it just the same as if i were grinding an organ
you have to get a licence for an organ and you havent got one and in that way you collect a crowd
what business is it of yours where do you lodge what a license wailed $katerina_ivanovna$ i buried my husband to #day#
what need of a license calm yourself madam calm yourself began the official come along i will escort you this is no place for you in the crowd
you are ill honoured sir honoured sir you dont know screamed $katerina_ivanovna$ we are going to the nevsky $sonia$ sonia
where is she she is crying too what the matter with you all $kolya$ lida where are you going she cried suddenly in alarm
$kolya$ and lida scared out of their wits by the crowd and their #mother# mad pranks suddenly seized each other by the #hand# and ran off at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere
oh silly #child# $kolya$ lida where are they off to weeping and wailing poor $katerina_ivanovna$ ran after them she was a piteous and unseemly spectacle as she ran weeping and panting for breath
$sonia$ and $polenka$ rushed after them bring them back bring them back $sonia$ oh stupid ungrateful #child# $polenka$ catch them
it for your sakes i she stumbled as she ran and fell down she cut herself she bleeding oh dear
$mr_raskolnikov$ and $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ were the first at her side the official too hastened up and behind him the policeman who muttered bother
cried $sonia$ bending over her all ran up and crowded around with a gesture of impatience feeling that the job was going to be a troublesome one
pass on pass on he said to the crowd that pressed forward she dying someone shouted she gone out of her mind said another
lord have mercy upon us said a woman crossing herself have they caught the little girl and the boy
when they examined $katerina_ivanovna$ carefully they saw that she had not cut herself against a stone as $sonia$ #thought# but that the blood that stained the pavement red was from her chest
they re being brought back the elder one got them ah the naughty imps i ve seen that before muttered the official to $mr_raskolnikov$ and $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ that consumption the blood flows and chokes the patient
i saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago nearly a pint of blood all in a minute
what to be done though she is dying this way this way to my room $sonia$ implored i live here
see that house the second from here come to me make haste she turned from one to the other send for the doctor
oh dear thanks to the official efforts this plan was adopted the policeman even helping to carry $katerina_ivanovna$ she was carried to $sonia$ room almost unconscious and laid on the bed
$mr_raskolnikov$ $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ and the official accompanied $sonia$ into the room and were followed by the policeman who first drove back the crowd which followed to the very #door#
the blood was still flowing but she seemed to be coming to herself $polenka$ came in holding $kolya$ and lida who were trembling and weeping
several persons came in too from the kapernaumovs room the landlord a lame one eyed #man# of strange appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush his wife a woman with an everlastingly scared expression and several open mouthed #child# with wonder struck faces
$mr_raskolnikov$ looked at him with surprise not understanding where he had come from and not having noticed him in the crowd
the official whispered to $mr_raskolnikov$ that he #thought# it was too late now for the doctor but he ordered him to be sent for
among these $mr_svidrigaïlov$ suddenly made his appearance a doctor and priest wore spoken of kapernaumov ran himself meanwhile $katerina_ivanovna$ had regained her breath
she looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at $sonia$ who stood pale and trembling wiping the sweat from her brow with a handkerchief
the bleeding ceased for a time at last she asked to be raised they sat her up on the bed supporting her on both sides
where are the #child# she said in a faint voice you ve brought them $polenka$ oh the sillies why did you run away
och once more her parched lips were covered with blood she moved her eyes looking about her so that how you live $sonia$
never once have i been in your room she looked at her with a face of suffering we have been your ruin $sonia$
$polenka$ lida $kolya$ come here well here they are $sonia$ take them all i #hand# them over to you i ve had enough
the ball is over cough lay me down let me die in peace they laid her back on the pillow
what the priest i dont want him you havent got a #rouble# to spare i have no sins god must forgive me without that
he knows how i have suffered and if he wont forgive me i dont care she sank more and more into uneasy delirium
at times she shuddered turned her eyes from side to side recognised everyone for a minute but at once sank into delirium again
her breathing was hoarse and difficult there was a sort of rattle in her throat i said to him your excellency she ejaculated gasping after each word
that $amalia_ludwigovna$ ah lida $kolya$ #hand# on your hips make haste glissez glissez pas de basque tap with your heels be a graceful #child#
du hast diamanten und perlen what next that the thing to sing du hast die schonsten augen madchen was willst du mehr
what an idea was willst du mehr what things the fool invents ah yes in the heat of midday in the vale of dagestan
ah how i loved it i loved that song to distraction $polenka$ your father you know used to sing it when we were engaged
oh those #day# oh that the thing for us to sing how does it go i ve forgotten remind me how was it
at last in a horribly hoarse broken voice she began shrieking and gasping at every word with a look of growing terror
she was violently excited and tried to sit up in the heat of midday in the vale of dagestan
with lead in my breast your excellency she wailed suddenly with a heart rending scream and a flood of tears protect the orphans
you have been their father guest one may say aristocratic she started regaining consciousness and gazed at all with a sort of terror but at once recognised $sonia$
$sonia$ sonia she articulated softly and caressingly as though surprised to find her there $sonia$ darling are you here too
they lifted her up again enough it over farewell poor thing i am done for i am broken
she cried with vindictive despair and her #head# fell heavily back on the pillow she sank into unconsciousness again but this time it did not last long
her pale yellow wasted face dropped back her mouth fell open her leg moved convulsively she gave a deep deep sigh and died
$sonia$ fell upon her flung her arms about her and remained motionless with her #head# pressed to the dead woman wasted bosom
though $kolya$ and lida did not understand what had happened they had a feeling that it was #something# terrible they put their #hand# on each other little shoulders stared straight at one another and both at once opened their mouths and began screaming
they were both still in their fancy dress one in a turban the other in the cap with the ostrich feather
$polenka$ threw herself at her #mother# feet kissing them and weeping violently and how did the certificate of merit come to be on the bed beside $katerina_ivanovna$
it lay there by the pillow $mr_raskolnikov$ saw it he walked away to the window $andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ skipped up to him
she is dead he said $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ i must have two words with you said $mr_svidrigaïlov$ coming up to them
$andrey_semyonovitch_lebeziatnikov$ at once made room for him and delicately withdrew $mr_svidrigaïlov$ drew $mr_raskolnikov$ further away i will undertake all the arrangements the funeral and that
i will put those two little ones and $polenka$ into some good orphan asylum and i will settle fifteen hundred #rouble# to be paid to each on coming of age so that $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ need have no anxiety about them
you know it a question of money and as i told you i have plenty to spare and i will pull her out of the mud too for she is a good girl isnt she
so tell $avdotya_romanovna$ that that is how i am spending her ten thousand what is your motive for such benevolence asked $mr_raskolnikov$
ah you sceptical person laughed $mr_svidrigaïlov$ i told you i had no need of that money wont you admit that it simply done from humanity
she wasnt a louse you know he pointed to the #corner# where the dead woman lay was she like some old pawnbroker woman
come you ll agree is $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ to go on living and doing wicked things or is she to die and if i didnt help them $polenka$ would go the same way
he said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness keeping his eyes fixed on $mr_raskolnikov$ who turned white and cold hearing his own phrases spoken to $sonia$
he quickly stepped back and looked wildly at $mr_svidrigaïlov$ how do you know he whispered hardly able to breathe
why i lodge here at $madame_resslich$ the other side of the #wall# here is kapernaumov and there lives $madame_resslich$ an old and devoted #friend# of mine
i am a neighbour you yes continued $mr_svidrigaïlov$ shaking with laughter i assure you on my honour dear $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ that you have interested me enormously
i told you we should become #friend# i foretold it well here we have and you will see what an accommodating person i am
a strange period began for $mr_raskolnikov$ it was as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape
recalling that period long after he believed that his mind had been clouded at times and that it had continued so with intervals till the final catastrophe
he was convinced that he had been mistaken about many things at that time for instance as to the date of certain events
anyway when he tried later on to piece his recollections together he learnt a great deal about himself from what other people told him
you ll see that you can get on with me part vi chapter i he had mixed up incidents and had explained events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination
but he remembered too moments hours perhaps whole #day# of complete apathy which came upon him as a reaction from his previous terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility sometimes seen in the dying
at times he was a prey to #agony# of morbid uneasiness amounting sometimes to panic he seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape from a full and clear understanding of his position
how glad he would have been to be free from some cares the neglect of which would have threatened him with complete inevitable ruin
certain essential facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome to him he was particularly worried about $mr_svidrigaïlov$ he might be said to be permanently thinking of $mr_svidrigaïlov$
from the time of $mr_svidrigaïlov$ too menacing and unmistakable words in $sonia$ room at the moment of $katerina_ivanovna$ death the normal working of his mind seemed to break down
at times finding himself in a solitary and remote part of the town in some wretched eating house sitting alone lost in #thought# hardly knowing how he had come there he suddenly #thought# of $mr_svidrigaïlov$
he recognised suddenly clearly and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an understanding with that #man# and to make what terms he could
walking outside the city gates one #day# he positively fancied that they had fixed a meeting there that he was waiting for $mr_svidrigaïlov$
another time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes and could not at first understand how he had come there
but during the two or three #day# after $katerina_ivanovna$ death he had two or three times met $mr_svidrigaïlov$ at $sonia$ lodging where he had gone aimlessly for a moment
they exchanged a few words and made no reference to the vital subject as though they were tacitly agreed not to speak of it for a time
but although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness $mr_raskolnikov$ was in no hurry for an explanation of it $katerina_ivanovna$ body was still lying in the coffin $mr_svidrigaïlov$ was busy making arrangements for the funeral
at their last meeting $mr_svidrigaïlov$ informed $mr_raskolnikov$ that he had made an arrangement and a very satisfactory one for $katerina_ivanovna$ #child# that he had through certain connections succeeded in getting hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at once placed in very suitable institutions that the money he had settled on them had been of great assistance as it is much easier to place orphans with some property than destitute ones
he said #something# too about $sonia$ and promised to come himself in a #day# or two to see $mr_raskolnikov$ mentioning that he would like to consult with him that there were things they must talk over
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ looked intently at $mr_raskolnikov$ and suddenly after a brief pause dropping his voice asked but how is it $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ you dont seem yourself
$sonia$ too was very busy this conversation took place in the passage on the stairs you look and you listen but you dont seem to understand
cheer up we ll talk things over i am only sorry i ve so much to do of my own business and other people
ah $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ he added suddenly what all #man# need is fresh air fresh air more than anything he moved to one side to make way for the priest and server who were coming up the stairs
they had come for the requiem service by $mr_svidrigaïlov$ orders it was sung twice a #day# punctually $mr_svidrigaïlov$ went his way
$mr_raskolnikov$ stood still a moment #thought# and followed the priest into $sonia$ room he stood at the #door# they began quietly slowly and mournfully singing the service
from his childhood the #thought# of death and the presence of death had #something# oppressive and mysteriously awful and it was long since he had heard the requiem service
and there was #something# else here as well too awful and disturbing he looked at the #child# they were all kneeling by the coffin $polenka$ was weeping
behind them $sonia$ prayed softly and as it were timidly weeping these last two #day# she hasnt said a word to me she hasnt glanced at me $mr_raskolnikov$ #thought# suddenly
the sunlight was bright in the room the incense rose in clouds the priest read give rest oh lord $mr_raskolnikov$ stayed all through the service
as he blessed them and took his leave the priest looked round strangely after the service $mr_raskolnikov$ went up to $sonia$
it seemed strange to him that there was no trace of repugnance no trace of disgust no tremor in her #hand#
she took both his #hand# and let her #head# sink on his shoulder this slight friendly gesture bewildered $mr_raskolnikov$ it was the furthest limit of self abnegation at least so he interpreted it
if it had been possible to escape to some solitude he would have #thought# himself lucky even if he had to spend his whole life there
$sonia$ said nothing $mr_raskolnikov$ pressed her #hand# and went out he felt very miserable but although he had almost always been by himself of late he had never been able to feel alone
sometimes he walked out of the town on to the high road once he had even reached a little wood but the lonelier the place was the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near him
it did not frighten him but greatly annoyed him so that he made haste to return to the town to mingle with the crowd to enter restaurants and taverns to walk in busy thoroughfares
one #day# at dusk he sat for an hour listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively enjoyed it
there he felt easier and even more solitary but at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again as though his conscience smote him
yet he felt at once that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness there was #something# requiring immediate decision but it was #something# he could not clearly understand or put into words
here i sit listening to singing is that what i ought to be doing he #thought# it was a hopeless tangle
no better the struggle again better $porfiry_petrovitch$ again or $mr_svidrigaïlov$ better some challenge again some attack yes yes he #thought#
he went out of the tavern and rushed away almost at a run the #thought# of $dounia$ and his #mother# suddenly reduced him almost to a panic
that night he woke up before morning among some bushes in krestovsky island trembling all over with fever he walked home and it was early morning when he arrived
he remembered that $katerina_ivanovna$ funeral had been fixed for that #day# and was glad that he was not present at it
after some hours sleep the fever left him but he woke up late two clock in the afternoon $nastasya$ brought him some food he ate and drank with appetite almost with greediness
his #head# was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three #day# he even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic
the #door# opened and $mr_razumihin$ came in ah he eating then he not ill said $mr_razumihin$ he took a chair and sat down at the table opposite $mr_raskolnikov$
he was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it he spoke with evident annoyance but without hurry or raising his voice
as far as i am concerned you may all go to hell but from what i see it clear to me that i cant make #head# or tail of it please dont think i ve come to ask you questions
he looked as though he had some special fixed determination listen he began resolutely i dont want to know hang it
if you begin telling me your secrets i dare say i shouldnt stay to listen i should go away cursing i have only come to find out once for all whether it a fact that you are mad
i admit i ve been disposed to that opinion myself judging from your stupid repulsive and quite inexplicable actions and from your recent behavior to your #mother# and sister
there is a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so only a monster or a madman could treat them as you have so you must be mad
when did you see them last just now havent you seen them since then what have you been doing with yourself
she had made up her mind to come to you $avdotya_romanovna$ tried to prevent her she wouldnt hear a word
tell me please i ve been to you three times already your #mother# has been seriously ill since yesterday if he is ill if his mind is giving way who can look after him like his #mother#
she said we all came here together we couldnt let her come alone all the way we kept begging her to be calm
she got up and said if he gone out that is if he is well and has forgotten his #mother# it humiliating and unseemly for his #mother# to stand at his #door# begging for kindness
we came in you werent here she sat down and stayed ten minutes while we stood waiting in silence she returned home and took to her bed now she is in a fever
i see she said that he has time for his girl she means by your girl $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ your betrothed or your mistress i dont know
i went at once to $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ for i wanted to know what was going on i looked round i saw the coffin the #child# crying and $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ trying them on mourning dresses
no sign of you i apologised came away and reported to $avdotya_romanovna$ so that all nonsense and you havent got a girl the most likely thing is that you are mad
but here you sit guzzling boiled beef as though you not had a bite for three #day# though as far as that goes madmen eat too but though you have not said a word to me yet
so you may go to hell all of you for there some mystery some secret about it and i dont intend to worry my brains over your secrets
you are not mad that i swear above all you are not mad so i ve simply come to swear at you he finished getting up to relieve my mind
and i know what to do now what do you mean to do now what business is it of yours what i mean to do
you are going in for a drinking bout how how did you know why it pretty plain $mr_razumihin$ paused for a minute
you always have been a very rational person and you ve never been mad never he observed suddenly with warmth
you re right i shall drink good bye and he moved to go out i was talking with my sister the #day# before yesterday i think it was about you $mr_razumihin$
about me but where can you have seen her the #day# before yesterday $mr_razumihin$ stopped short and even turned a little pale
one could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently she came here by herself sat there and talked to me
she did yes what did you say to her i mean about me i told her you were a very good honest and industrious #man#
i didnt tell her you love her because she knows that herself she knows that herself well it pretty plain
wherever i might go whatever happened to me you would remain to look after them i so to speak give them into your keeping $mr_razumihin$
i say this because i know quite well how you love her and am convinced of the purity of your heart
i know that she too may love you and perhaps does love you already now decide for yourself as you know best whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not
$rodya$ you see well ach damn it but where do you mean to go of course if it all a secret never mind
i shall find out the secret and i am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense and that you ve made it all up
that was just what i wanted to add only you interrupted that that was a very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets
but i anyway you are a capital fellow a capital fellow leave it to time dont worry about it
you ll know it all in time when it must be yesterday a #man# said to me that what a #man# needs is fresh air fresh air fresh air
i mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant by that $mr_razumihin$ stood lost in #thought# and excitement making a silent conclusion
he a political conspirator he must be and he on the eve of some desperate #step# that certain it can only be that
so $avdotya_romanovna$ comes to see you he said weighing each syllable and you re going to see a #man# who says we need more air and
and and $dounia$ knows he #thought# suddenly so of course that letter that too must have #something# to do with it he concluded to himself
what letter she got a letter to #day# it upset her very much very much indeed too much so i began speaking of you she begged me not to
then then she said that perhaps we should very soon have to part then she began warmly thanking me for #something# then she went to her room and locked herself in
she got a letter $mr_raskolnikov$ asked thoughtfully yes and you didnt know hm they were both silent
good bye $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ there was a time brother when i never mind good bye you see there was a time well good bye
he hurried out but when he had almost closed the #door# behind him he suddenly opened it again and said looking away oh by the way do you remember that murder you know $porfiry_petrovitch$ that old woman
i must be off too i am not going to drink there no need now that all stuff do you know the murderer has been found he has confessed and given the proofs
would you believe it all that scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs while the porter and the two witnesses were going up he got up on purpose to disarm suspicion
it one of those very workmen the painter only fancy do you remember i defended them here the cunning the presence of mind of the young dog
one can hardly credit it but it his own explanation he has confessed it all and what a fool i was about it
well he simply a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of the lawyers so there nothing much to wonder at i suppose
of course people like that are always possible and the fact that he couldnt keep up the character but confessed makes him easier to believe in
but what a fool i was i was frantic on their side tell me please from whom did you hear that and why does it interest you so
$mr_raskolnikov$ asked with unmistakable agitation what next you ask me why it interests me well i heard it from $porfiry_petrovitch$ among others
it was from him i heard almost all about it from $porfiry_petrovitch$ from $porfiry_petrovitch$ what what did he say
$mr_raskolnikov$ asked in dismay he gave me a capital explanation of it psychologically after his fashion he explained it
explained it himself yes yes good bye i ll tell you all about it another time but now i busy there was a time when i fancied
but no matter another time what need is there for me to drink now you have made me drunk without wine
i am drunk $rodya$ good bye i going i ll come again very soon he went out he a political conspirator there not a doubt about it $mr_razumihin$ decided as he slowly descended the stairs
and he drawn his sister in that quite quite in keeping with $avdotya_romanovna$ character there are interviews between them
she hinted at it too so many of her words and hints bear that meaning and how else can all this tangle be explained
hm and i was almost thinking good heavens what i #thought# yes i took leave of my senses and i wronged him
it was his doing under the lamp in the corridor that #day# pfoo what a crude nasty vile idea on my part
$nikolay$ is a brick for confessing and how clear it all is now his illness then all his strange actions before this in the university how morose he used to be how gloomy
but what the meaning now of that letter there #something# in that too perhaps whom was it from i suspect no i must find out
as soon as $mr_razumihin$ went out $mr_raskolnikov$ got up turned to the window walked into one #corner# and then into another as though forgetting the smallness of his room and sat down again on the sofa
he #thought# of $dounia$ realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed and he suddenly broke into a run he felt so to speak renewed again the struggle so a means of escape had come
yes a means of escape had come it had been too stifling too cramping the burden had been too agonising
a lethargy had come upon him at times from the moment of the scene with $nikolay$ at $porfiry_petrovitch$ he had been suffocating penned in without #hope# of escape
after $nikolay$ confession on that very #day# had come the scene with $sonia$ his behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he could have imagined beforehand he had grown feebler instantly and fundamentally
and he had agreed at the time with $sonia$ he had agreed in his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his mind
and $mr_svidrigaïlov$ was a riddle he worried him that was true but somehow not on the same #point# he might still have a struggle to come with $mr_svidrigaïlov$
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ too might be a means of escape but $porfiry_petrovitch$ was a different matter and so $porfiry_petrovitch$ himself had explained it to $mr_razumihin$ had explained it psychologically
but to think that $porfiry_petrovitch$ should for one moment believe that $nikolay$ was guilty after what had passed between them before $nikolay$ appearance after that tête tête interview which could have only one explanation
during those #day# $mr_raskolnikov$ had often recalled passages in that scene with $porfiry_petrovitch$ he could not bear to let his mind rest on it
such words such gestures had passed between them they had exchanged such glances things had been said in such a tone and had reached such a pass that $nikolay$ whom $porfiry_petrovitch$ had seen through at the first word at the first gesture could not have shaken his conviction
he had begun bringing in his damned psychology again $porfiry_petrovitch$ and to think that even $mr_razumihin$ had begun to suspect
the scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then he had rushed to $porfiry_petrovitch$ but what had induced the latter to receive him like that
what had been his object in putting $mr_razumihin$ off with $nikolay$ he must have some plan there was some design but what was it
it was true that a long time had passed since that morning too long a time and no sight nor sound of $porfiry_petrovitch$
well that was a bad sign $mr_raskolnikov$ took his cap and went out of the room still pondering it was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind at least
i must settle $mr_svidrigaïlov$ he #thought# and as soon as possible he too seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own accord
and at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his weary heart that he might have killed either of those two $porfiry_petrovitch$ or $mr_svidrigaïlov$
at least he felt that he would be capable of doing it later if not now we shall see we shall see he repeated to himself
but no sooner had he opened the #door# than he stumbled upon $porfiry_petrovitch$ himself in the passage he was coming in to see him
$mr_raskolnikov$ was dumbfounded for a minute but only for one minute strange to say he was not very much astonished at seeing $porfiry_petrovitch$ and scarcely afraid of him
he was simply startled but was quickly instantly on his guard perhaps this will mean the #end# but how could $porfiry_petrovitch$ have approached so quietly like a cat so that he had heard nothing
i ve been meaning to look in a long time i was passing by and #thought# why not go in for five minutes
could he have been listening at the #door# you didnt expect a visitor $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ $porfiry_petrovitch$ explained laughing are you going out
$mr_raskolnikov$ gave his visitor a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have marvelled at himself if he could have seen it
i wont keep you long just let me have one cigarette sit down $porfiry_petrovitch$ sit down the last moment had come the last drops had to be drained
so a #man# will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand yet when the knife is at his throat at last he feels no fear
$mr_raskolnikov$ seated himself directly facing $porfiry_petrovitch$ and looked at him without flinching $porfiry_petrovitch$ screwed up his eyes and began lighting a cigarette
speak speak seemed as though it would burst from $mr_raskolnikov$ heart come why dont you speak chapter ii ah these cigarettes
$porfiry_petrovitch$ ejaculated at last having lighted one they are pernicious positively pernicious and yet i cant give them up
i cough i begin to have tickling in my throat and a difficulty in breathing you know i am a coward
i went lately to dr n he always gives at least half an hour to each patient he positively laughed looking at me he sounded me tobacco bad for you he said your lungs are affected
but how am i to give it up what is there to take its place i dont drink that the mischief he
he he that i dont everything is relative $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ everything is relative why he playing his professional tricks again $mr_raskolnikov$ #thought# with disgust
all the circumstances of their last interview suddenly came back to him and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon him then
i came to see you the #day# before yesterday in the #evening# you didnt know $porfiry_petrovitch$ went on looking round the room
i came into this very room i was passing by just as i did to #day# and i #thought# i return your call
i walked in as your #door# was wide open i looked round waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant
dont you lock your #door# $mr_raskolnikov$ face grew more and more gloomy $porfiry_petrovitch$ seemed to guess his state of mind
i owe you an explanation and must give it to you he continued with a slight smile just patting $mr_raskolnikov$ knee
but almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his face to his surprise $mr_raskolnikov$ saw a touch of sadness in it
i ve come to have it out with you $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ my dear fellow he had never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face
a strange scene passed between us last time we met $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ our first interview too was a strange one but then and one thing after another
this is the #point# i have perhaps acted unfairly to you i feel it do you remember how we parted your nerves were unhinged and your knees were shaking and so were mine
and you know our behaviour was unseemly even ungentlemanly and yet we are gentlemen above all in any case gentlemen that must be understood
do you remember what we came to and it was quite indecorous what is he up to what does he take me for
i ve decided openness is better between us $porfiry_petrovitch$ went on turning his #head# away and dropping his eyes as though unwilling to disconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles
$mr_raskolnikov$ asked himself in amazement raising his #head# and looking with open eyes on $porfiry_petrovitch$ yes such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long
$nikolay$ put a stop to it or i dont know what we might not have come to that damned workman was sitting at the time in the next room can you realise that
but what you supposed then was not true i had not sent for #anyone# i had made no #kind# of arrangements
you know that of course and i am aware that he came to you afterwards you ask why i hadnt what shall i say to you
it had all come upon me so suddenly i had scarcely sent for the porters you noticed them as you went out i dare say
an idea flashed upon me i was firmly convinced at the time you see $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ come i #thought# even if i let one thing slip for a time i shall get hold of #something# else
you are nervously irritable $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ by #temperament# it out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character which i flatter myself
of course i did reflect even then that it does not always happen that a #man# gets up and blurts out his whole #story#
i shant lose what i want anyway i have to some extent divined it does happen sometimes if you make a #man# lose all patience though even then it rare
if i only had a fact i #thought# the least little fact to go upon #something# i could lay hold of #something# tangible not merely psychological
for if a #man# is guilty you must be able to get #something# substantial out of him one may reckon upon most surprising results indeed
i was capable of realising that i was reckoning on your #temperament# $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ on your #temperament# above all things i had great #hope# of you at that time
but what are you driving at now $mr_raskolnikov$ muttered at last asking the question without thinking what is he talking about
he wondered distractedly does he really take me to be innocent what am i driving at i ve come to explain myself i consider it my duty so to speak
i want to make clear to you how the whole business the whole misunderstanding arose i ve caused you a great deal of suffering $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$
i understand what it must mean for a #man# who has been unfortunate but who is proud imperious and above all impatient to have to bear such treatment
i regard you in any case as a #man# of noble character and not without elements of magnanimity though i dont agree with all your convictions
i am not a monster i wanted to tell you this first frankly and quite sincerely for above all i dont want to deceive you
when i made your acquaintance i felt attracted by you perhaps you will laugh at my saying so you have a right to
you may think what you like but i #desire# now to do all i can to efface that impression and to show that i am a #man# of heart and conscience
i know you disliked me from the first and indeed you ve no reason to like me i speak sincerely $porfiry_petrovitch$ made a dignified pause
$mr_raskolnikov$ felt a rush of renewed alarm the #thought# that $porfiry_petrovitch$ believed him to be innocent began to make him uneasy
it scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail $porfiry_petrovitch$ went on indeed i could scarcely attempt it
to begin with there were rumours through whom how and when those rumours came to me and how they affected you i need not go into
my suspicions were aroused by a complete accident which might just as easily not have happened what was it hm i believe there is no need to go into that either
i admit it openly for one may as well make a clean breast of it i was the first to pitch on you
those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind the old woman notes on the pledges and the rest of it that all came to nothing
i happened too to hear of the scene at the office from a #man# who described it capitally unconsciously reproducing the scene with great vividness
yours was one of a hundred it was just one thing after another $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ my dear fellow how could i avoid being brought to certain ideas
from a hundred rabbits you cant make a horse a hundred suspicions dont make a proof as the english proverb says but that only from the rational #point# of view you cant help being partial for after all a lawyer is only human
i #thought# too of your article in that journal do you remember on your first visit we talked of it i jeered at you at the time but that was only to lead you on
i repeat $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ you are ill and impatient that you were bold headstrong in earnest and had felt a great deal i recognised long before
i too have felt the same so that your article seemed familiar to me it was conceived on sleepless nights with a throbbing heart in ecstasy and suppressed enthusiasm
i jeered at you then but let me tell you that as a literary amateur i am awfully fond of such first essays full of the heat of youth
and that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is dangerous there is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist
your article is absurd and fantastic but there a transparent sincerity a youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it
it a gloomy article but that what fine in it i read your article and put it aside thinking as i did so that #man# wont go the common way
well i ask you after that as a preliminary how could i help being carried away by what followed oh dear i am not saying anything i am not making any statement now
i simply noted it at the time what is there in it i reflected there nothing in it that is really nothing and perhaps absolutely nothing
here i have $nikolay$ on my #hand# with actual evidence against him you may think what you like of it but it evidence
and it not at all the thing for the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions he brings in his psychology too one has to consider him too for it a matter of life and death
why am i explaining this to you that you may understand and not blame my malicious behaviour on that occasion it was not malicious i assure you he he
i was here when you were lying ill in bed not officially not in my own person but i was here
do you suppose i didnt come to search your room at the time i did i did he he your room was searched to the last thread at the first suspicion but umsonst
i #thought# to myself now that #man# will come will come of himself and quickly too if he guilty he sure to come
we arranged that to excite you so we purposely spread rumours that he might discuss the case with you and $mr_razumihin$ is not a #man# to restrain his indignation
another #man# wouldnt but he will and you remember how $mr_razumihin$ began discussing the subject with you $mr_zametov$ was tremendously struck by your anger and your open daring
think of blurting out in a restaurant i killed her it was too daring too reckless i #thought# so myself if he is guilty he will be a formidable opponent
that was what i #thought# at the time i was expecting you but you simply bowled $mr_zametov$ over and well you see it all lies in this that this damnable psychology can be taken two ways
well i kept expecting you and so it was you came my heart was fairly throbbing ach now why need you have come
i saw it all plain as daylight but if i hadnt expected you so specially i should not have noticed anything in your laughter
your laughter too as you came in do you remember you see what influence a mood has $mr_razumihin$ then ah that stone that stone under which the things were hidden
i seem to see it somewhere in a kitchen garden it was in a kitchen garden you told $mr_zametov$ and afterwards you repeated that in my office
and when we began picking your article to pieces how you explained it one could take every word of yours in two senses as though there were another meaning hidden
so in this way $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ i reached the furthest limit and knocking my #head# against a post i pulled myself up asking myself what i was about
after all i said you can take it all in another sense if you like and it more natural so indeed
i couldnt help admitting it was more natural i was bothered no i better get hold of some little fact i said
so when i heard of the bell ringing i held my breath and was all in a tremor here is my little fact #thought# i and i didnt think it over i simply wouldnt
i would have given a thousand #rouble# at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes when you walked a hundred paces beside that workman after he had called you murderer to your face and you did not dare to ask him a question all the way
and then what about your trembling what about your bell ringing in your illness in semi delirium and so $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ can you wonder that i played such pranks on you
and what made you come at that very minute someone seemed to have sent you by jove and if $nikolay$ had not parted us and do you remember $nikolay$ at the time
do you remember him clearly it was a thunderbolt a regular thunderbolt and how i met him i didnt believe in the thunderbolt not for a minute
even afterwards when you had gone and he began making very very plausible answers on certain #point# so that i was surprised at him myself even then i didnt believe his #story#
you could see it for yourself and how could i you see what it is to be as firm as a rock
no #thought# i morgenfrüh what has $nikolay$ got to do with it $mr_razumihin$ told me just now that you think $nikolay$ guilty and had yourself assured him of it
he had been listening in indescribable agitation as this #man# who had seen through and through him went back upon himself
his voice failed him and he broke off he was afraid of believing it and did not believe it in those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for #something# more definite and conclusive
$mr_razumihin$ cried $porfiry_petrovitch$ seeming glad of a question from $mr_raskolnikov$ who had till then been silent he he he
but i had to put $mr_razumihin$ off two is company three is none $mr_razumihin$ is not the right #man# besides he is an outsider
to return to $nikolay$ would you like to know what sort of a type he is how i understand him that is
he came running to me with a pale face but never mind him why bring him in to begin with he is still a #child# and not exactly a coward but #something# by way of an artist
really dont laugh at my describing him so he is innocent and responsive to influence he has a heart and is a fantastic fellow
he attends school too and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger to him he will drink himself senseless not as a regular vice but at times when people treat him like a #child#
he sings and dances he tells #story# they say so that people come from other villages to hear him and he stole too then without knowing it himself for how can it be stealing if one picks it up
there have been wanderers in his family and he was for two years in his village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder
and do you know he is an old believer or rather a dissenter i learnt all this from $nikolay$ and from his fellow villagers
and what more he wanted to run into the wilderness he was full of fervour prayed at night read the old books the true ones and read himself crazy
a religious sect translator note petersburg had a great effect upon him especially the women and the wine he responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that
i learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him and used to go and see him and now this business came upon him
well he was frightened he tried to hang himself he ran away how can one get over the idea the people have of russian legal proceedings
the very word trial frightens some of them whose fault is it we shall see what the new juries will do
god grant they do good well in prison it seems he remembered the venerable elder the bible too made its appearance again
do you know $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ the force of the word suffering among some of these people it not a question of suffering for someone benefit but simply one must suffer
in my time there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison always reading his bible on the stove at night
if they suffer at the #hand# of the authorities so much the better and he read himself crazy and so crazy do you know
that one #day# apropos of nothing he seized a brick and flung it at the governor though he had done him no harm
and the way he threw it too aimed it a yard on one side on purpose for fear of hurting him
well we know what happens to a prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon so he took his suffering
so i suspect now that $nikolay$ wants to take his suffering or #something# of the sort i know it for certain from facts indeed
only he doesnt know that i know what you dont admit that there are such fantastic people among the peasants lots of them
the elder now has begun influencing him especially since he tried to hang himself but he ll come and tell me all himself
you think he ll hold out wait a bit he ll take his words back i am waiting from hour to hour for him to come and abjure his evidence
i have come to like that $nikolay$ and am studying him in detail and what do you think he he he answered me very plausibly on some #point# he obviously had collected some evidence and prepared himself cleverly
but on other #point# he is simply at sea knows nothing and doesnt even suspect that he doesnt know no $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ $nikolay$ doesnt come in
this is a fantastic gloomy business a modern case an incident of to #day# when the heart of #man# is troubled when the phrase is quoted that blood renews when comfort is preached as the aim of life
here we see resolution in the first stage but resolution of a special #kind# he resolved to do it like jumping over a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the crime
here we have bookish dreams a heart unhinged by theories he forgot to shut the #door# after him and murdered two people for a theory
he committed the murder and couldnt take the money and what he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone
it wasnt enough for him to suffer #agony# behind the #door# while they battered at the #door# and rung the bell no he had to go to the empty lodging half delirious to recall the bell ringing he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again
well that we grant was through illness but consider this he is a murderer but looks upon himself as an honest #man# despises others poses as injured innocence
no that not the work of a $nikolay$ my dear $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ all that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that these words were too great a shock
$mr_raskolnikov$ shuddered as though he had been stabbed then who then is the murderer he asked in a breathless voice unable to restrain himself
$porfiry_petrovitch$ sank back in his chair as though he were amazed at the question who is the murderer
he repeated as though unable to believe his ears why you $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ you are the murderer he added almost in a whisper in a voice of genuine conviction
$mr_raskolnikov$ leapt from the sofa stood up for a few seconds and sat down again without uttering a word his face twitched convulsively
your lip is twitching just as it did before $porfiry_petrovitch$ observed almost sympathetically you ve been misunderstanding me i think $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ he added after a brief pause that why you are so surprised
i came on purpose to tell you everything and deal openly with you it was not i murdered her $mr_raskolnikov$ whispered like a frightened #child# caught in the act
no it was you you $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ and no one else $porfiry_petrovitch$ whispered sternly with conviction they were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long about ten minutes
$mr_raskolnikov$ put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers through his hair $porfiry_petrovitch$ sat quietly waiting suddenly $mr_raskolnikov$ looked scornfully at $porfiry_petrovitch$
you are at your old tricks again $porfiry_petrovitch$ your old method again i wonder you dont get sick of it
oh stop that what does that matter now it would be a different matter if there were witnesses present but we are whispering alone
you see yourself that i have not come to chase and capture you like a hare whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now for myself i am convinced without it
if so what did you come for $mr_raskolnikov$ asked irritably i ask you the same question again if you consider me guilty why dont you take me to prison
oh that your question i will answer you #point# for #point# in the first place to arrest you so directly is not to my interest
how so if you are convinced you ought ach what if i am convinced that only my dream for the time
why should i put you in safety you know that it since you ask me to do it if i confront you with that workman for instance
and you say to him were you drunk or not who saw me with you i simply took you to be drunk and you were drunk too
well what could i answer especially as your #story# is a more likely one than his for there nothing but psychology to support his evidence
that almost unseemly with his ugly mug while you hit the mark exactly for the rascal is an inveterate drunkard and
and i have myself admitted candidly several times already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the second way is stronger and looks far more probable and that apart from that i have as yet nothing against you
and though i shall put you in prison and indeed have come quite contrary to etiquette to inform you of it beforehand yet i tell you frankly also contrary to etiquette that it wont be to my advantage
notoriously so well secondly i ve come to you because yes yes secondly $mr_raskolnikov$ was listening breathless because as i told you just now i consider i owe you an explanation
i dont want you to look upon me as a monster as i have a genuine liking for you you may believe me or not
and in the third place i ve come to you with a direct and open proposition that you should surrender and confess it will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my advantage too for my task will be done
well is this open on my part or not $mr_raskolnikov$ #thought# a minute listen $porfiry_petrovitch$ you said just now you have nothing but psychology to go on yet now you ve gone on mathematics
well what if you are mistaken yourself now no $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ i am not mistaken i have a little fact even then providence sent it me
what little fact i wont tell you what $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ and in any case i havent the right to put it off any longer i must arrest you
so think it over it makes no difference to me now and so i speak only for your sake believe me it will be better $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$
why even if i were guilty which i dont admit what reason should i have to confess when you tell me yourself that i shall be in greater safety in prison
$mr_raskolnikov$ smiled malignantly that not simply ridiculous it positively shameless ah $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ dont put too much faith in words perhaps prison will not be altogether a restful place
that only theory and my theory and what authority am i for you perhaps too even now i am hiding #something# from you
i cant lay bare everything he he and how can you ask what advantage dont you know how it would lessen your #sentence#
you would be confessing at a moment when another #man# has taken the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case
we will make a clean sweep of all these psychological #point# of a suspicion against you so that your crime will appear to have been #something# like an aberration for in truth it was an aberration
consider that i swear before god that i will so arrange that your confession shall come as a complete surprise i am an honest #man# $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ and will keep my word
$mr_raskolnikov$ maintained a mournful silence and let his #head# sink dejectedly he pondered a long while and at last smiled again but his smile was sad and gentle
he said apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances with $porfiry_petrovitch$ it not worth it i dont care about lessening the #sentence#
no that just what i was afraid of $porfiry_petrovitch$ cried warmly and as it seemed involuntarily that just what i feared that you wouldnt care about the mitigation of #sentence#
$mr_raskolnikov$ looked sadly and expressively at him ah dont disdain life $porfiry_petrovitch$ went on you have a great deal of it still before you
how can you say you dont want a mitigation of #sentence# you are an impatient fellow a great deal of what lies before me
of life what sort of prophet are you do you know much about it seek and ye shall find this may be god means for bringing you to him
and it not for ever the bondage the time will be shortened laughed $mr_raskolnikov$ why is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of
it may be that you are afraid of it without knowing it because you are young but anyway you shouldnt be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing
ach hang it $mr_raskolnikov$ whispered with loathing and contempt as though he did not want to speak aloud he got up again as though he meant to go away but sat down again in evident despair
hang it if you like you ve lost faith and you think that i am grossly flattering you but how long has your life been
you made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be not at all original
how much do you understand it turned out #something# base that true but you are not hopelessly base by no means so base
at least you didnt deceive yourself for long you went straight to the furthest #point# at one bound how do i regard you
i regard you as one of those #man# who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts their entrails out if only they have found faith or god
find it and you will live you have long needed a change of air suffering too is a good thing suffer
i know you dont believe in it but dont be over wise fling yourself straight into life without deliberation dont be afraid the flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again
maybe $nikolay$ is right in wanting to suffer what bank how can i tell i only believe that you have long life before you
i know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared beforehand but maybe you will remember them after
they may be of use some time that why i speak it as well that you only killed the old woman
if you invented another theory you might perhaps have done #something# a thousand times more hideous you ought to thank god perhaps
how do you know perhaps god is saving you for #something# but keep a good heart and have less fear are you afraid of the great expiation before you
no it would be shameful to be afraid of it since you have taken such a #step# you must harden your heart
there is justice in it you must fulfil the demands of justice i know that you dont believe it but indeed life will bring you through
you will live it down in time what you need now is fresh air fresh air fresh air $mr_raskolnikov$ positively started
but who are you what prophet are you from the height of what majestic calm do you proclaim these words of wisdom
who am i i am a #man# with nothing to #hope# for that all a #man# perhaps of feeling and sympathy maybe of some knowledge too but my #day# is over
but you are a different matter there is life waiting for you though who knows maybe your life too will pass off in smoke and come to nothing
come what does it matter that you will pass into another class of #man# it not comfort you regret with your heart
what of it that perhaps no one will see you for so long it not time but yourself that will decide that
be the sun and all will see you the sun has before all to be the sun why are you smiling again
at my being such a schiller i bet you re imagining that i am trying to get round you by flattery well perhaps i am he he he
but let me add you can judge for yourself i think how far i am a base sort of #man# and how far i am honest
perhaps you better not believe my word perhaps you better never believe it altogether i made that way i confess it when do you mean to arrest me
well i can let you walk about another #day# or two think it over my dear fellow and pray to god
it more in your interest believe me and what if i run away asked $mr_raskolnikov$ with a strange smile
a peasant would run away a fashionable dissenter would run away the flunkey of another #man# #thought# for you ve only to show him the #end# of your little finger and he ll be ready to believe in anything for the rest of his life
no you wont run away but you ve ceased to believe in your theory already what will you run away with and what would you do in hiding
it would be hateful and difficult for you and what you need more than anything in life is a definite position an atmosphere to suit you
and what sort of atmosphere would you have if you ran away you come back to yourself you cant get on without us
and if i put you in prison say you ve been there a month or two or three remember my word you ll confess of yourself and perhaps to your own surprise
you wont know an hour beforehand that you are coming with a confession i am convinced that you will decide to take your suffering
you dont believe my words now but you ll come to it of yourself for suffering $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ is a great thing
never mind my having grown fat i know all the same dont laugh at it there an idea in suffering nokolay is right
no you wont run away $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ $mr_raskolnikov$ got up and took his cap $porfiry_petrovitch$ also rose are you going for a walk
the #evening# will be fine if only we dont have a storm though it would be a good thing to freshen the air
he too took his cap $porfiry_petrovitch$ please dont take up the notion that i have confessed to you to #day# $mr_raskolnikov$ pronounced with sullen insistence
you re a strange #man# and i have listened to you from simple curiosity but i have admitted nothing remember that
oh i know that i ll remember look at him he trembling dont be uneasy my dear fellow have it your own way
walk about a bit you wont be able to walk too far if anything happens i have one request to make of you he added dropping his voice
if anything were to happen though indeed i dont believe in it and think you quite incapable of it yet in case you were taken during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an #end# to the business in some other way in some fantastic fashion laying #hand# on yourself it an absurd proposition but you must forgive me for it do leave a brief but precise note only two lines and mention the stone
it an awkward one but important it will be more generous come till we meet good #thought# and sound decisions to you
the latter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he calculated that $porfiry_petrovitch$ had reached the #street# and moved away
$porfiry_petrovitch$ went out stooping and avoiding looking at $mr_raskolnikov$ then he too went hurriedly out of the room chapter iii he hurried to $mr_svidrigaïlov$
what he had to #hope# from that #man# he did not know but that #man# had some hidden power over him
having once recognised this he could not rest and now the time had come on the way one question particularly worried him had $mr_svidrigaïlov$ been to $porfiry_petrovitch$
as far as he could judge he would swear to it that he had not he pondered again and again went over $porfiry_petrovitch$ visit no he hadnt been of course he hadnt
he could not have explained but if he could he would not have wasted much #thought# over it at the moment
but if he had not been yet would he go meanwhile for the present he fancied he couldnt why it all worried him and at the same time he could not attend to it
strange to say none would have believed it perhaps but he only felt a faint vague anxiety about his immediate future
moreover he was conscious of immense moral fatigue though his mind was working better that morning than it had done of late
another much more important anxiety tormented him it concerned himself but in a different more vital way and was it worth while after all that had happened to contend with these new trivial difficulties
was it worth while for instance to manoeuvre that $mr_svidrigaïlov$ should not go to $porfiry_petrovitch$ was it worth while to investigate to ascertain the facts to waste time over #anyone# like $mr_svidrigaïlov$
oh how sick he was of it all and yet he was hastening to $mr_svidrigaïlov$ could he be expecting #something# new from him information or means of escape
#man# will catch at straws was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together perhaps it was only fatigue despair perhaps it was not $mr_svidrigaïlov$
but some other whom he needed and $mr_svidrigaïlov$ had simply presented himself by chance $sonia$ but what should he go to $sonia$ for now
to beg her tears again he was afraid of $sonia$ too $sonia$ stood before him as an irrevocable #sentence# he must go his own way or hers
at that moment especially he did not feel equal to seeing her no would it not be better to try $mr_svidrigaïlov$
and he could not help inwardly owning that he had long felt that he must see him for some reason but what could they have in common
their very evil doing could not be of the same #kind# the #man# moreover was very unpleasant evidently depraved undoubtedly cunning and deceitful possibly malignant
such #story# were told about him it is true he was befriending $katerina_ivanovna$ #child# but who could tell with what motive and what it meant
the #man# always had some design some project there was another #thought# which had been continually hovering of late about $mr_raskolnikov$ mind and causing him great uneasiness
it was so painful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it he sometimes #thought# that $mr_svidrigaïlov$ was dogging his footsteps
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ had found out his secret and had had designs on $dounia$ what if he had them still wasnt it practically certain that he had
and what if having learnt his secret and so having gained power over him he were to use it as a weapon against $dounia$
this idea sometimes even tormented his dreams but it had never presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to $mr_svidrigaïlov$
to begin with this would transform everything even his own position he would have at once to confess his secret to $dounia$
the very #thought# moved him to gloomy rage would he have to give himself up perhaps to prevent $dounia$ from taking some rash #step#
the letter this morning $dounia$ had received a letter from whom could she get letters in petersburg $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ perhaps it true
$mr_razumihin$ was there to protect her but $mr_razumihin$ knew nothing of the position perhaps it was his duty to tell $mr_razumihin$
thank god the details of the interview were of little consequence if only he could get at the root of the matter but if $mr_svidrigaïlov$ were capable if he were intriguing against $dounia$ then
$mr_raskolnikov$ was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month that he could only decide such questions in one way then i shall kill him he #thought# in cold despair
a sudden anguish oppressed his heart he stood still in the middle of the #street# and began looking about to see where he was and which way he was going
he #thought# of it with repugnance in any case he must see $mr_svidrigaïlov$ as soon as possible he decided finally he found himself in prospect thirty or forty paces from the hay market through which he had come
the whole second storey of the house on the left was used as a tavern all the windows were wide open judging from the figures moving at the windows the rooms were full to overflowing
there were sounds of singing of clarionet and violin and the boom of a turkish drum he could hear women shrieking
he was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the prospect when suddenly at one of the #end# windows he saw $mr_svidrigaïlov$ sitting at a tea table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ was silently watching and scrutinising him and what struck $mr_raskolnikov$ at once seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved
$mr_raskolnikov$ at once pretended not to have seen him but to be looking absent mindedly away while he watched him out of the #corner# of his eye
$mr_raskolnikov$ was dreadfully taken aback almost terrified his heart was beating violently yet it was evident that $mr_svidrigaïlov$ did not want to be seen
he took the pipe out of his mouth and was on the #point# of concealing himself but as he got up and moved back his chair he seemed to have become suddenly aware that $mr_raskolnikov$ had seen him and was watching him
what had passed between them was much the same as what happened at their first meeting in $mr_raskolnikov$ room a sly smile came into $mr_svidrigaïlov$ face and grew broader and broader
each knew that he was seen and watched by the other at last $mr_svidrigaïlov$ broke into a loud laugh well well come in
he found $mr_svidrigaïlov$ in a tiny back room adjoining the saloon in which merchants clerks and numbers of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the desperate bawling of a chorus of singers
if you want me i am here he shouted from the window $mr_raskolnikov$ went up into the tavern the click of billiard balls could be heard in the distance
in the room he found also a boy with a little #hand# organ a healthy looking red cheeked girl of eighteen wearing a tucked up striped skirt and a tyrolese hat with ribbons
in #spite# of the chorus in the other room she was singing some servants hall song in a rather husky contralto to the accompaniment of the organ
on the table before $mr_svidrigaïlov$ stood an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne come that enough $mr_svidrigaïlov$ stopped her at $mr_raskolnikov$ entrance
the girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully she had sung her guttural rhymes too with a serious and respectful expression in her face
hey philip a glass shouted $mr_svidrigaïlov$ i wont drink anything said $mr_raskolnikov$ as you like i didnt mean it for you
drink katia i dont want anything more to #day# you can go he poured her out a full glass and laid down a yellow note
katia drank off her glass of wine as women do without putting it down in twenty gulps took the note and kissed $mr_svidrigaïlov$ #hand# which he allowed quite seriously
she went out of the room and the boy trailed after her with the organ both had been brought in from the #street#
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ had not been a week in petersburg but everything about him was already so to speak on a patriarchal footing the waiter philip was by now an old #friend# and very obsequious
the #door# leading to the saloon had a lock on it $mr_svidrigaïlov$ was at home in this room and perhaps spent whole #day# in it
i was going to see you and looking for you $mr_raskolnikov$ began but i dont know what made me turn from the hay market into the prospect just now
the tavern was dirty and wretched not even second rate i never take this turning i turn to the right from the hay market
and this isnt the way to you i simply turned and here you are it is strange why dont you say at once it a miracle
because it may be only chance oh that the way with all you folk laughed $mr_svidrigaïlov$ you wont admit it even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle
here you say that it may be only chance and what cowards they all are here about having an opinion of their own you cant fancy $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$
i dont mean you you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to have it that how it was you attracted my curiosity
well that enough you know $mr_svidrigaïlov$ was obviously exhilarated but only slightly so he had not had more than half a glass of wine
i fancy you came to see me before you knew that i was capable of having what you call an opinion of my own observed $mr_raskolnikov$
and apropos of the miracle let me tell you that i think you have been asleep for the last two or three #day#
nothing else oh well it was a different matter everyone has his own plans i told you of this tavern myself there is no miracle in your coming straight here
i explained the way myself told you where it was and the hours you could find me here do you remember
i dont remember answered $mr_raskolnikov$ with surprise i believe you i told you twice the address has been stamped mechanically on your memory
you turned this way mechanically and yet precisely according to the direction though you are not aware of it when i told you then i hardly hoped you understood me
you give yourself away too much $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ and another thing i convinced there are lots of people in petersburg who talk to themselves as they walk
if only we had scientific #man# doctors lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable investigations in petersburg each in his own line
there are few places where there are so many gloomy strong and queer influences on the soul of #man# as in petersburg
this is a town of crazy people the mere influences of climate mean so much and it the administrative centre of all russia and its character must be reflected on the whole country
you walk out of your house holding your #head# high twenty paces from home you let it sink and fold your #hand# behind your back
but that is neither here nor there now the #point# is that i have several times watched you you look and evidently see nothing before nor beside you
at last you begin moving your lips and talking to yourself and sometimes you wave one #hand# and declaim and at last stand still in the middle of the road
that not at all the thing someone may be watching you besides me and it wont do you any good it nothing really to do with me
and i cant cure you but of course you understand me do you know that i am being followed asked $mr_raskolnikov$ looking inquisitively at him
no i know nothing about it said $mr_svidrigaïlov$ seeming surprised well then let us leave me alone $mr_raskolnikov$ muttered frowning
you had better tell me if you come here to drink and directed me twice to come here to you why did you hide and try to get away just now when i looked at the window from the #street#
you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and pretended to be asleep though you were wide awake while i stood in your doorway
very good let us leave you alone i saw it he he and why was it i saw it
i may have had reasons you know that yourself and i may have had my reasons though you dont know them
$mr_raskolnikov$ dropped his right elbow on the table leaned his chin in the fingers of his right #hand# and stared intently at $mr_svidrigaïlov$
it was a strange face like a mask white and red with bright red lips with a flaxen beard and still thick flaxen hair
for a full minute he scrutinised his face which had impressed him before his eyes were somehow too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed
there was #something# awfully unpleasant in that handsome face which looked so wonderfully young for his age $mr_svidrigaïlov$ was smartly dressed in light summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen
have i got to bother myself about you too now said $mr_raskolnikov$ suddenly coming with nervous impatience straight to the #point#
even though perhaps you are the most dangerous #man# if you care to injure me i dont want to put myself out any more
he wore a huge ring with a precious stone in it i will show you at once that i dont prize myself as you probably think i do
i ve come to tell you at once that if you keep to your former #intention# with regard to my sister and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has been discovered of late i will kill you before you get me locked up
and in the second place if you want to tell me anything for i keep fancying all this time that you have #something# to tell me make haste and tell it for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late
you can reckon on my word you know that i can keep it why in such haste asked $mr_svidrigaïlov$ looking at him curiously
you urged me yourself to frankness just now and at the first question you refuse to answer $mr_svidrigaïlov$ observed with a smile
everyone has his plans $mr_raskolnikov$ answered gloomily and impatiently you keep fancying that i have aims of my own
and so you look at me with suspicion of course it perfectly natural in your position but though i should like to be #friend# with you i shant trouble myself to convince you of the contrary
the game isnt worth the candle and i wasnt intending to talk to you about anything special what did you want me for then
it was you who came hanging about me why simply as an interesting subject for observation i liked the fantastic nature of your position that what it was
besides you are the brother of a person who greatly interested me and from that person i had in the past heard a very great deal about you from which i gathered that you had a great influence over her isnt that enough
here you for instance have come to me not only for a definite object but for the sake of hearing #something# new
ha ha ha still i must admit that your question is rather complex and is difficult for me to answer isnt that so
well cant you fancy then that i too on my way here in the train was reckoning on you on your telling me #something# new and on my making some profit out of you
isnt that so persisted $mr_svidrigaïlov$ with a sly smile you see what rich #man# we are what profit could you make
how can i tell you how do i know you see in what a tavern i spend all my time and it my enjoyment
that to say it no great enjoyment but one must sit somewhere that poor katia now you saw her if only i had been a glutton now a club gourmand but you see i can eat this
he pointed to a little table in the #corner# where the remnants of a terrible looking beef steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish
have you dined by the way i ve had #something# and want nothing more i dont drink for instance at all
except for champagne i never touch anything and not more than a glass of that all the #evening# and even that is enough to make my #head# ache
i ordered it just now to wind myself up for i am just going off somewhere and you see me in a peculiar state of mind
that was why i hid myself just now like a schoolboy for i was afraid you would hinder me but i believe he pulled out his watch i can spend an hour with you
it half past four now if only i been #something# a landowner a father a cavalry officer a photographer a journalist i am nothing no specialty and sometimes i am positively bored
i really #thought# you would tell me #something# new but what are you and why have you come here
you know a gentleman i served for two years in the cavalry then i knocked about here in petersburg then i married $marfa_petrovna$ and lived in the country
what am i there you have my biography you are a gambler i believe no a poor sort of gambler
a card sharper not a gambler you have been a card sharper then yes i ve been a card sharper too didnt you get thrashed sometimes
it did happen why why you might have challenged them altogether it must have been lively i wont contradict you and besides i am no #hand# at philosophy
i confess that i hastened here for the sake of the women as soon as you buried $marfa_petrovna$ quite so $mr_svidrigaïlov$ smiled with engaging candour
what of it you seem to find #something# wrong in my speaking like that about women you ask whether i find anything wrong in vice
vice oh that what you are after but i ll answer you in order first about women in general you know i am fond of talking
tell me what should i restrain myself for why should i give up women since i have a passion for them
it an occupation anyway so you #hope# for nothing here but vice oh very well for vice then you insist on its being vice
in this vice at least there is #something# permanent founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy #something# present in the blood like an ever burning ember for ever setting one on fire
but anyway i like a direct question and maybe not to be quickly extinguished even with years you ll agree it an occupation of a sort
that nothing to rejoice at it a #disease# and a dangerous one oh that what you think is it
i agree that it is a #disease# like everything that exceeds moderation and of course in this one must exceed moderation
but in the first place everybody does so in one way or another and in the second place of course one ought to be moderate and prudent
however mean it may be but what am i to do if i hadnt this i might have to shoot myself
i am ready to admit that a decent #man# ought to put up with being bored but yet and could you shoot yourself
please dont speak of it he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown in all the previous conversation
oh come $mr_svidrigaïlov$ parried with disgust his face quite changed i admit it an unpardonable weakness but i cant help it
i am afraid of death and i dislike its being talked of do you know that i am to a certain extent a mystic
ah the apparitions of $marfa_petrovna$ do they still go on visiting you oh dont talk of them there have been no more in petersburg confound them
he cried with an air of irritation let rather talk of that though m i have not much time and cant stay long with you it a pity
i should have found plenty to tell you what your engagement a woman yes a woman a casual incident
no that not what i want to talk of and the hideousness the filthiness of all your surroundings doesnt that affect you
have you lost the strength to stop yourself and do you pretend to strength too he he he you surprised me just now $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ though i knew beforehand it would be so
of course that all as it should be and it would be surprising if it were not so yet it is strange in reality
you preach to me about vice and æsthetics you a schiller you an idealist ah what a pity i have no time for you re a most interesting type
and by the way are you fond of schiller i am awfully fond of him but what a braggart you are $mr_raskolnikov$ said with some disgust
upon my word i am not answered $mr_svidrigaïlov$ laughing however i wont dispute it let me be a braggart why not brag if it hurts no one
i spent seven years in the country with $marfa_petrovna$ so now when i come across an intelligent person like you intelligent and highly interesting i am simply glad to talk and besides i ve drunk that half glass of champagne
and it gone to my #head# a little and besides there a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously but about that i will keep quiet
where are you off to he asked in alarm $mr_raskolnikov$ had begun getting up he felt oppressed and stifled and as it were ill at ease at having come here
he felt convinced that $mr_svidrigaïlov$ was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth a ach sit down stay a little
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ begged let them bring you some tea anyway stay a little i wont talk nonsense about myself i mean
i ll tell you #something# if you like i ll tell you how a woman tried to save me as you would call it
it will be an answer to your first question indeed for the woman was your sister may i tell you it will help to spend the time
tell me but i trust that you oh dont be uneasy besides even in a worthless low fellow like me $avdotya_romanovna$ can only excite the deepest respect
you know perhaps yes i told you myself began $mr_svidrigaïlov$ that i was in the debtors prison here for an immense sum and had not any expectation of being able to pay it
there no need to go into particulars how $marfa_petrovna$ bought me out do you know to what a #point# of insanity a woman can sometimes love
would you believe that this honest and jealous woman after many scenes of hysterics and reproaches condescended to enter into a #kind# of contract with me which she kept throughout our married life
chapter iv she was an honest woman and very sensible although completely uneducated she was considerably older than i and besides she always kept a clove or #something# in her mouth
there was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too of a sort as to tell her straight out that i couldnt be absolutely faithful to her
she #thought# it showed i was unwilling to deceive her if i warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous woman you know that the first consideration
this confession drove her to frenzy but yet she seems in a way to have liked my brutal frankness after many tears an unwritten contract was drawn up between us
first that i would never leave $marfa_petrovna$ and would always be her husband secondly that i would never absent myself without her permission thirdly that i would never set up a permanent mistress fourthly in return for this $marfa_petrovna$ gave me a free #hand# with the maidservants but only with her secret knowledge fifthly god forbid my falling in love with a woman of our class sixthly in case i which god forbid should be visited by a great serious passion i was bound to reveal it to $marfa_petrovna$
she was a sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute profligate incapable of real love
on this last score however $marfa_petrovna$ was fairly at ease but a sensible woman and a jealous woman are two very different things and that where the trouble came in
but to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people about us
i have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than in #anyone# perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was ridiculous and absurd about $marfa_petrovna$
she certainly had some very ridiculous ways but i tell you frankly that i feel really sorry for the innumerable woes of which i was the cause
well and that enough i think by way of a decorous oraison funèbre for the most tender wife of a most tender husband
when we quarrelled i usually held my tongue and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to attain its object it influenced her it pleased her indeed
these were times when she was positively proud of me but your sister she couldnt put up with anyway and however she came to risk taking such a beautiful creature into her house as a governess
my explanation is that $marfa_petrovna$ was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell in love herself literally fell in love with your sister
i saw the danger at the first glance and what do you think i resolved not to look at her even
would you believe it too that $marfa_petrovna$ was positively angry with me at first for my persistent silence about your sister for my careless reception of her continual adoring praises of $avdotya_romanovna$
well little wonder look at $avdotya_romanovna$ but $avdotya_romanovna$ herself made the first #step# would you believe it i dont know what it was she wanted
she had the unfortunate habit of telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually complaining of me how could she fail to confide in such a delightful new #friend#
i expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt $avdotya_romanovna$ heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were current about me
well of course $marfa_petrovna$ told $avdotya_romanovna$ every detail about me i dont mind betting that you too have heard #something# of the sort already
i have $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ charged you with having caused the death of a #child# is that true dont refer to those vulgar tales i beg said $mr_svidrigaïlov$ with disgust and annoyance
if you insist on wanting to know about all that idiocy i will tell you one #day# but now i was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you treated badly
i beg you to drop the subject $mr_svidrigaïlov$ interrupted again with obvious impatience was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe
you told me about it yourself $mr_raskolnikov$ felt more and more irritated $mr_svidrigaïlov$ looked at him attentively and $mr_raskolnikov$ fancied he caught a flash of spiteful mockery in that look
i see that you too are extremely interested and shall feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity
but $mr_svidrigaïlov$ restrained himself and answered very civilly yes it was upon my soul i see that i really might pass for a romantic figure with some people
judge how grateful i must be to $marfa_petrovna$ for having repeated to $avdotya_romanovna$ such mysterious and interesting gossip about me
with all $avdotya_romanovna$ natural aversion and in #spite# of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect she did at least feel pity for me pity for a lost soul
i dare not guess what impression it made on her but in any case it worked in my interests and if once a girl heart is moved to pity it more dangerous than anything
she is bound to want to save him to bring him to his senses and lift him up and draw him to nobler aims and restore him to new life and usefulness well we all know how far such dreams can go
i saw at once that the bird was flying into the cage of herself and i too made ready i think you are frowning $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$
do you know i always from the very beginning regretted that it wasnt your sister fate to be born in the second or third century a as the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro consul in asia minor
she would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot pincers
there no need as you know it all ended in smoke hang it all what a lot i am drinking and she would have gone to it of herself
and in the fourth or fifth century she would have walked away into the egyptian desert and would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and visions
she is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone and if she cant get her torture she ll throw herself out of a window
i ve heard #something# of a $mr_razumihin$ he said to be a sensible fellow his surname suggests it indeed he probably a divinity student
well he better look after your sister i believe i understand her and i am proud of it but at the beginning of an acquaintance as you know one is apt to be more heedless and stupid
one doesnt see clearly hang it all why is she so handsome it not my fault in fact it began on my side with a most irresistible physical #desire#
$avdotya_romanovna$ is awfully chaste incredibly and phenomenally so take note i tell you this about your sister as a fact
she is almost morbidly chaste in #spite# of her broad intelligence and it will stand in her way there happened to be a girl in the house then
parasha a black eyed wench whom i had never seen before she had just come from another village very pretty but incredibly stupid she burst into tears wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal
one #day# after dinner $avdotya_romanovna$ followed me into an avenue in the garden and with flashing eyes insisted on my leaving poor parasha alone
i of course was only too pleased to obey her wishes tried to appear disconcerted embarrassed in fact played my part not badly
it was almost our first conversation by ourselves then came interviews mysterious conversations exhortations entreaties supplications even tears would you believe it even tears
i of course threw it all on my destiny posed as hungering and thirsting for light and finally resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the female heart a weapon which never fails one
think what the passion for propaganda will bring some girls to it the well known resource flattery nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery
if there the hundredth part of a false note in speaking the truth it leads to a discord and that leads to trouble
but if all to the last note is false in flattery it is just as agreeable and is heard not without satisfaction
it may be a coarse satisfaction but still a satisfaction and however coarse the flattery at least half will be sure to seem true
i can never remember without laughter how i once seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband her #child# and her principles
that so for all stages of development and classes of society a vestal virgin might be seduced by flattery what fun it was and how little trouble
and the lady really had principles of her own anyway all my tactics lay in simply being utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity
i flattered her shamelessly and as soon as i succeeded in getting a pressure of the #hand# even a glance from her i would reproach myself for having snatched it by force and would declare that she had resisted so that i could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled
i maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my treachery and yielded to me unconsciously unawares and so on
in fact i triumphed while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was innocent chaste and faithful to all her duties and obligations and had succumbed quite by accident
and how angry she was with me when i explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was just as eager as i poor $marfa_petrovna$ was awfully weak on the side of flattery and if i had only cared to i might have had all her property settled on me during her lifetime
i #hope# you wont be angry if i mention now that i was beginning to produce the same effect on $avdotya_romanovna$
i am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talking too much but i was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all
$avdotya_romanovna$ had several times and one time in particular been greatly displeased by the expression of my eyes would you believe it
there was sometimes a light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and more unguarded till it was hateful to her
i fell to jeering in the coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me parasha came on to the scene again and not she alone in fact there was a tremendous to do
no need to go into detail but we parted there i acted stupidly again ah $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ if you could only see how your sister eyes can flash sometimes
never mind my being drunk at this moment and having had a whole glass of wine i am speaking the truth
i assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams the very rustle of her dress was more than i could stand at last
i really began to think that i might become epileptic i could never have believed that i could be moved to such a frenzy
it was essential indeed to be reconciled but by then it was impossible and imagine what i did then to what a pitch of stupidity a #man# can be brought by frenzy
never undertake anything in a frenzy $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ i reflected that $avdotya_romanovna$ was after all a beggar ach excuse me
but does it matter if it expresses the meaning that she lived by her work that she had her #mother# and you to keep ach hang it you are frowning again and i resolved to offer her all my money thirty thousand #rouble# i could have realised then if she would run away with me here to petersburg
do you know i was so wild about her at that time that if she had told me to poison $marfa_petrovna$ or to cut her throat and to marry herself it would have been done at once
that not the word of course i should have vowed eternal love rapture and so on but it ended in the catastrophe of which you know already
you can fancy how frantic i was when i heard that $marfa_petrovna$ had got hold of that scoundrelly attorney $pyotr_petrovitch_luzhin$ and had almost made a match between them which would really have been just the same thing as i was proposing
wouldnt it wouldnt it i notice that you ve begun to be very attentive you interesting young #man# $mr_svidrigaïlov$ struck the table with his fist impatiently
$mr_raskolnikov$ saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne that he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him and he resolved to take advantage of the opportunity
well after what you have said i am fully convinced that you have come to petersburg with designs on my sister he said directly to $mr_svidrigaïlov$ in order to irritate him further
he was flushed he felt very suspicious of $mr_svidrigaïlov$ oh nonsense said $mr_svidrigaïlov$ seeming to rouse himself why i told you besides your sister cant endure me
yes i am certain that she cant but that not the #point# are you so sure that she cant $mr_svidrigaïlov$ screwed up his eyes and smiled mockingly
you are right she doesnt love me but you can never be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and mistress
there always a little #corner# which remains a secret to the world and is only known to those two will you answer for it that $avdotya_romanovna$ regarded me with aversion
from some words you ve dropped i notice that you still have designs and of course evil ones on $dounia$ and mean to carry them out promptly
what have i dropped words like that $mr_svidrigaïlov$ asked in naïve dismay taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his designs
why you are dropping them even now why are you so frightened what are you so afraid of now me afraid
afraid of you you have rather to be afraid of me cher ami but what nonsense i ve drunk too much though i see that
i was almost saying too much again damn the wine hi there water he snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of the window
philip brought the water that all nonsense said $mr_svidrigaïlov$ wetting a towel and putting it to his #head# but i can answer you in one word and annihilate all your suspicions
but i couldnt have told you so for certain for i had not even seen my betrothed i only meant to
but now i really have a betrothed and it a settled thing and if it werent that i have business that cant be put off i would have taken you to see them at once for i should like to ask your advice
do you know that i am going to get married you told me so before did i i ve forgotten ach hang it only ten minutes left
see look at the watch but i must tell you for it an interesting #story# my marriage in its own way
where are you off to going again no i not going away now not at all we shall see
i ll take you there i ll show you my betrothed only not now for you ll soon have to be off you have to go to the right
and i to the left do you know that $madame_resslich$ the woman i am lodging with now eh i know what you re thinking that she the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter
come are you listening she arranged it all for me you re bored she said you want #something# to fill up your time
for you know i am a gloomy depressed person do you think i light hearted no i gloomy i do no harm but sit in a #corner# without speaking a word for three #day# at a time
i know what she has got in her mind she thinks i shall get sick of it abandon my wife and depart and she ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her in our class of course or higher
she told me the father was a broken down retired official who has been sitting in a chair for the last three years with his legs paralysed
there is a son serving in the provinces but he doesnt help there is a daughter who is married but she doesnt visit them
and they ve two little nephews on their #hand# as though their own #child# were not enough and they ve taken from school their youngest daughter a girl who ll be sixteen in another month so that then she can be married
and that $madame_resslich$ is a sly hussy i tell you the mamma she said was a sensible woman she was for me
we went there how funny it was i present myself a landowner a widower of a well known name with connections with a fortune
what if i am fifty and she is not sixteen who thinks of that but it fascinating isnt it it is fascinating ha ha
you should have seen how i talked to the papa and mamma it was worth paying to have seen me at that moment
she comes in curtseys you can fancy still in a short frock an unopened bud flushing like a sunset she had been told no doubt
i dont know how you feel about female faces but to my mind these sixteen years these childish eyes shyness and tears of bashfulness are better than beauty and she is a perfect little picture too
fair hair in little curls like a lamb full little rosy lips tiny feet a charmer well we made #friend#
i told them i was in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances and the next #day# that is the #day# before yesterday we were betrothed
when i go now i take her on my knee at once and keep her there well she flushes like a sunset
and i kiss her every minute her mamma of course impresses on her that this is her husband and that this must be so
it simply delicious the present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage here you have what is called la nature et la vérité ha ha
i ve talked to her twice she is far from a fool sometimes she steals a look at me that positively scorches me
her face is like raphael madonna you know the sistine madonna face has #something# fantastic in it the face of mournful religious ecstasy
the #day# after we been betrothed i bought her presents to the value of fifteen hundred #rouble# a set of diamonds and another of pearls and a silver dressing case as large as this with all sorts of things in it so that even my madonna face glowed
i sat her on my knee yesterday and i suppose rather too unceremoniously she flushed crimson and the tears started but she didnt want to show it
we were left alone she suddenly flung herself on my neck for the first time of her own accord put her little arms round me kissed me and vowed that she would be an obedient faithful and good wife would make me happy would devote all her life every minute of her life would sacrifice everything everything and that all she asks in return is my respect and that she wants nothing nothing more from me no presents
you ll admit that to hear such a confession alone from an angel of sixteen in a muslin frock with little curls with a flush of maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is rather fascinating
havent you noticed it well she #something# in that line isnt it fascinating it worth paying for isnt it well listen we ll go to see my betrothed only not just now
the fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites your sensuality will you really make such a marriage
why of course everyone thinks of himself and he lives most gaily who knows best how to deceive himself ha ha but why are you so keen about virtue
have mercy on me my good #friend# i am a sinful #man# ha ha ha but you have provided for the #child# of $katerina_ivanovna$
though though you had your own reasons i understand it all now i am always fond of #child# very fond of them laughed $mr_svidrigaïlov$
i can tell you one curious instance of it the first #day# i came here i visited various haunts after seven years i simply rushed at them
you probably notice that i am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my old #friend# i shall do without them as long as i can
do you know when i was with $marfa_petrovna$ in the country i was haunted by the #thought# of these places where #anyone# who knows his way about can find a great deal
the peasants have vodka the educated young people shut out from activity waste themselves in impossible dreams and visions and are crippled by theories jews have sprung up and are amassing money and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery
yes upon my soul from the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours i chanced to be in a frightful den
i like my dens dirty it was a dance so called and there was a cancan such as i never saw in my #day#
all of a sudden i saw a little girl of thirteen nicely dressed dancing with a specialist in that line with another one vis vis
yes there you have progress her #mother# was sitting on a chair by the #wall# you cant fancy what a cancan that was
the girl was ashamed blushed at last felt insulted and began to cry her partner seized her and began whirling her round and performing before her everyone laughed and
i like your public even the cancan public they laughed and shouted serves her right serves her right shouldnt bring #child# well it not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or not
i at once fixed on my plan sat down by the #mother# and began by saying that i too was a stranger and that people here were ill bred and that they couldnt distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect gave her to understand that i had plenty of money offered to take them home in my carriage
i took them home and got to know them they were lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the country
she told me that she and her daughter could only regard my acquaintance as an honour i found out that they had nothing of their own and had come to town upon some legal business
i proffered my services and money i learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon by mistake believing that it was a genuine dancing class
i offered to assist in the young girl education in french and dancing my offer was accepted with enthusiasm as an honour and we are still friendly
if you like we ll go and see them only not just now stop enough of your vile nasty anecdotes depraved vile sensual #man#
schiller you are a regular schiller la vertu vat elle se nicher but you know i shall tell you these things on purpose for the pleasure of hearing your outcries
i dare say i can see i am ridiculous myself muttered $mr_raskolnikov$ angrily $mr_svidrigaïlov$ laughed heartily finally he called philip paid his bill and began getting up
i say but i am drunk assez causé he said it been a pleasure i should rather think it must be a pleasure
no doubt it is a pleasure for a worn out profligate to describe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in his mind especially under such circumstances and to such a #man# as me
well if you come to that $mr_svidrigaïlov$ answered scrutinising $mr_raskolnikov$ with some surprise if you come to that you are a thorough cynic yourself
cried $mr_raskolnikov$ getting up it stimulating you ve plenty to make you so anyway you can understand a great deal and you can do a great deal too
but enough i sincerely regret not having had more talk with you but i shant lose sight of you only wait a bit
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ was not however very drunk the wine had affected him for a moment but it was passing off every minute
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ walked out of the restaurant $mr_raskolnikov$ walked out after him he was preoccupied with #something# of importance and was frowning
he was apparently excited and uneasy in anticipation of #something# his manner to $mr_raskolnikov$ had changed during the last few minutes and he was ruder and more sneering every moment
$mr_raskolnikov$ noticed all this and he too was uneasy he became very suspicious of $mr_svidrigaïlov$ and resolved to follow him they came out on to the pavement
you go to the right and i to the left or if you like the other way only adieu mon plaisir may we meet again
and he walked to the right towards the hay market chapter $mr_raskolnikov$ walked after him what this cried $mr_svidrigaïlov$ turning round i #thought# i said
it means that i am not going to lose sight of you now what both stood still and gazed at one another as though measuring their strength
from all your half tipsy #story# $mr_raskolnikov$ observed harshly i am positive that you have not given up your designs on my sister but are pursuing them more actively than ever
i have learnt that my sister received a letter this morning you have hardly been able to sit still all this time
you may have unearthed a wife on the way but that means nothing i should like to make certain myself
$mr_raskolnikov$ could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he wished to make certain upon my word
i ll call the police call away again they stood for a minute facing each other at last $mr_svidrigaïlov$ face changed having satisfied himself that $mr_raskolnikov$ was not frightened at his threat he assumed a mirthful and friendly air
what a fellow i purposely refrained from referring to your affair though i am devoured by curiosity it a fantastic affair
i ve put it off till another time but you re enough to rouse the dead well let us go only i warn you beforehand
i am only going home for a moment to get some money then i shall lock up the flat take a cab and go to spend the #evening# at the islands
i coming to your lodgings not to see you but $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ to say i sorry not to have been at the funeral
now now are you going to follow me that as you like but $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ is not at home
she has taken the three #child# to an old lady of high rank the patroness of some orphan asylums whom i used to know years ago
i charmed the old lady by depositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three #child# of $katerina_ivanovna$ and subscribing to the institution as well
i told her too the #story# of $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ in full detail suppressing nothing it produced an indescribable effect on her
that why $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ has been invited to call to #day# at the hotel where the lady is staying for the time
no matter i ll come all the same as you like it nothing to me but i wont come with you here we are at home
by the way i am convinced that you regard me with suspicion just because i have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled you with questions
you understand it struck you as extraordinary i dont mind betting it that well it teaches one to show delicacy
and to listen at #door# ah that it is it laughed $mr_svidrigaïlov$ yes i should have been surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened
though i did understand #something# of the pranks you had been up to and were telling $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ about what was the meaning of it
ha ha perhaps i am quite behind the times and cant understand for goodness sake explain it my dear boy expound the latest theories
you couldnt have heard anything you re making it all up but i not talking about that though i did hear #something#
no i talking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now the schiller in you is in revolt every moment and now you tell me not to listen at #door#
if that how you feel go and inform the police that you had this mischance you made a little mistake in your theory
but if you are convinced that one mustnt listen at #door# but one may murder old women at one pleasure you better be off to america and make haste
run young #man# there may still be time i speaking sincerely havent you the money i ll give you the fare
i not thinking of that at all $mr_raskolnikov$ interrupted with disgust i understand but dont put yourself out dont discuss it if you dont want to
i understand the questions you are worrying over moral ones arent they duties of citizen and #man# lay them all aside they are nothing to you now ha ha
you ll say you are still a #man# and a citizen if so you ought not to have got into this coil
it no use taking up a job you are not #fit# for well you better shoot yourself or dont you want to
you seem trying to enrage me to make me leave you what a queer fellow but here we are welcome to the #staircase#
you see that the way to $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ look there is no one at home dont you believe me ask kapernaumov
she leaves the key with him here is madame de kapernaumov herself hey what she is rather deaf has she gone out
where did you hear she is not in and wont be till late in the #evening# probably well come to my room you wanted to come and see me didnt you
here we are $madame_resslich$ not at home she is a woman who is always busy an excellent woman i assure you
i take this five per cent bond out of the bureau see what a lot i ve got of them still this one will be turned into cash to #day#
she might have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible now see i mustnt waste any more time
the bureau is locked the flat is locked and here we are again on the stairs shall we take a cab
i going to the islands would you like a lift i ll take this carriage ah you refuse you are tired of it
come for a drive i believe it will come on to rain never mind we ll put down the hood $mr_svidrigaïlov$ was already in the carriage
$mr_raskolnikov$ decided that his suspicions were at least for that moment unjust without answering a word he turned and walked back towards the hay market
if he had only turned round on his way he might have seen $mr_svidrigaïlov$ get out not a hundred paces off dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement
to think that i could for one instant have looked for help from that coarse brute that depraved sensualist and blackguard he cried
$mr_raskolnikov$ judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily there was #something# about $mr_svidrigaïlov$ which gave him a certain original even a mysterious character
but he had turned the #corner# and could see nothing intense disgust drew him away from $mr_svidrigaïlov$ as concerned his sister $mr_raskolnikov$ was convinced that $mr_svidrigaïlov$ would not leave her in peace
but it was too tiresome and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this when he was alone he had not gone twenty paces before he sank as usual into deep #thought#
on the bridge he stood by the railing and began gazing at the water and his sister was standing close by him
he met her at the entrance to the bridge but passed by without seeing her $dounia$ had never met him like this in the #street# before and was struck with dismay
she stood still and did not know whether to call to him or not suddenly she saw $mr_svidrigaïlov$ coming quickly from the direction of the hay market
he did not go on to the bridge but stood aside on the pavement doing all he could to avoid $mr_raskolnikov$ seeing him
he seemed to be approaching cautiously he had observed $dounia$ for some time and had been making signs to her she fancied he was signalling to beg her not to speak to her brother but to come to him
that was what $dounia$ did she stole by her brother and went up to $mr_svidrigaïlov$ let us make haste away $mr_svidrigaïlov$ whispered to her i dont want $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ to know of our meeting
i must tell you i ve been sitting with him in the restaurant close by where he looked me up and i had great difficulty in getting rid of him
he has somehow heard of my letter to you and suspects #something# it wasnt you who told him of course but
if not you who then well we ve turned the #corner# now $dounia$ interrupted and my brother wont see us i have to tell you that i am going no further with you
in the first place i cant say it in the #street# secondly you must hear $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ too and thirdly i will show you some papers
oh well if you wont agree to come with me i shall refuse to give any explanation and go away at once
but i beg you not to forget that a very curious secret of your beloved brother is entirely in my keeping
speak to me here you can tell it all in the #street# $dounia$ stood still hesitating and looked at $mr_svidrigaïlov$ with searching eyes
what are you afraid of he observed quietly the town is not the country and even in the country you did me more harm than i did you
have you prepared $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ no i have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she is at home now
but most likely she is she has buried her stepmother to #day# she is not likely to go visiting on such a #day#
for the time i dont want to speak to #anyone# about it and i half regret having spoken to you the slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like this
i live there in that house we are coming to it that the porter of our house he knows me very well
you see he bowing he sees i coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious
excuse my putting things so coarsely i havent a flat to myself $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ room is next to mine she lodges in the next flat
the whole floor is let out in lodgings why are you frightened like a #child# am i really so terrible
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ lips were twisted in a condescending smile but he was in no smiling mood his heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe
but $dounia$ did not notice this peculiar excitement she was so irritated by his remark that she was frightened of him like a #child# and that he was so terrible to her
he spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement though i know that you are not a #man# of honour i am not in the least afraid of you
lead the way she said with apparent composure but her face was very pale $mr_svidrigaïlov$ stopped at $sonia$ room allow me to inquire whether she is at home
she is not how unfortunate but i know she may come quite soon if she gone out it can only be to see a lady about the orphans
their #mother# is dead i ve been meddling and making arrangements for them if $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ does not come back in ten minutes i will send her to you to #day# if you like
this is my flat these are my two rooms $madame_resslich$ my landlady has the next room now look this way
i will show you my chief piece of evidence this #door# from my bedroom leads into two perfectly empty rooms which are to let
here they are you must look into them with some attention $mr_svidrigaïlov$ occupied two fairly large furnished rooms $dounia$ was looking about her mistrustfully but saw nothing special in the furniture or position of the rooms
yet there was #something# to observe for instance that $mr_svidrigaïlov$ flat was exactly between two sets of almost uninhabited apartments his rooms were not entered directly from the passage but through the landlady two almost empty rooms
unlocking a #door# leading out of his bedroom $mr_svidrigaïlov$ showed $dounia$ the two empty rooms that were to let $dounia$ stopped in the doorway not knowing what she was called to look upon but $mr_svidrigaïlov$ hastened to explain
look here at this second large room notice that #door# it locked by the #door# stands a chair the only one in the two rooms
i brought it from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently just the other side of the #door# is $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ table she sat there talking to $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$
and i sat here listening on two successive #evening# for two hours each time and of course i was able to learn #something# what do you think
you listened yes i did now come back to my room we cant sit down here he brought $avdotya_romanovna$ back into his sitting room and offered her a chair
he sat down at the opposite side of the table at least seven feet from her but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which had once frightened $dounia$ so much
she shuddered and once more looked about her distrustfully it was an involuntary gesture she evidently did not wish to betray her uneasiness
but the secluded position of $mr_svidrigaïlov$ lodging had suddenly struck her she wanted to ask whether his landlady at least were at home but pride kept her from asking
moreover she had another trouble in her heart incomparably greater than fear for herself she was in great distress here is your letter she said laying it on the table
can it be true what you write you hint at a crime committed you say by my brother you hint at it too clearly you darent deny it now
i must tell you that i heard of this stupid #story# before you wrote and dont believe a word of it
it a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion i know the #story# and why and how it was invented you can have no proofs
you promised to prove it speak but let me warn you that i dont believe you i dont believe you $dounia$ said this speaking hurriedly and for an instant the colour rushed to her face
if you didnt believe it how could you risk coming alone to my rooms why have you come simply from curiosity
dont torment me speak speak there no denying that you are a brave girl upon my word i #thought# you would have asked $mr_razumihin$ to escort you here
but he was not with you nor anywhere near i was on the look out it spirited of you it proves you wanted to spare $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$
but everything is divine in you about your brother what am i to say to you you ve just seen him yourself
what did you think of him surely that not the only thing you are building on no not on that but on his own words
he came here on two successive #evening# to see $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ i ve shown you where they sat he made a full confession to her
he killed her sister too a pedlar woman called $lizaveta_ivanovna$ who happened to come in while he was murdering her sister
he is a murderer he killed an old woman a pawnbroker with whom he had pawned things himself he killed them with an axe he brought with him
he murdered them to rob them and he did rob them he took money and various things he told all this word for word to $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ the only person who knows his secret
but she has had no share by word or deed in the murder she was as horrified at it as you are now
dont be anxious she wont betray him it cannot be muttered $dounia$ with white lips she gasped for breath it cannot be
there was not the slightest cause no sort of ground it a lie a lie he robbed her that was the cause he took money and things
it true that by his own admission he made no use of the money or things but hid them under a stone where they are now
but that was because he dared not make use of them but how could he steal rob how could he dream of it
cried $dounia$ and she jumped up from the chair why you know him and you ve seen him can he be a thief
she seemed to be imploring $mr_svidrigaïlov$ she had entirely forgotten her fear there are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities $avdotya_romanovna$
a thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel but i ve heard of a gentleman who broke open the mail who knows very likely he #thought# he was doing a gentlemanly thing
of course i should not have believed it myself if i been told of it as you have but i believe my own ears
he explained all the causes of it to $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ too but she did not believe her ears at first yet she believed her own eyes at last
how shall i tell you a theory of a sort the same one by which i for instance consider that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right a solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds
it galling too of course for a young #man# of gifts and overweening pride to know that if he had for instance a paltry three thousand his whole career his whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three thousand
add to that nervous irritability from hunger from lodging in a hole from rags from a vivid sense of the charm of his social position and his sister and #mother# position too
above all vanity pride and vanity though goodness knows he may have good qualities too i am not blaming him please dont think it besides it not my business
a special little theory came in too a theory of a sort dividing mankind you see into material and superior persons that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their superiority who make laws for the rest of mankind the material that is
what were the causes it a long #story# $avdotya_romanovna$ here it all right as a theory une théorie comme une autre
$napoleon$ attracted him tremendously that is what affected him was that a great many #man# of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing but have overstepped the law without thinking about it
he has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he could make a theory but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law and so he is not a #man# of genius
he seems to have fancied that he was a genius too that is he was convinced of it for a time and that humiliating for a young #man# of any pride in our #day# especially
but remorse you deny him any moral feeling then is he like that ah $avdotya_romanovna$ everything is in a muddle now not that it was ever in very good order
russians in general are broad in their ideas $avdotya_romanovna$ broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to the fantastic the chaotic
do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on this subject sitting in the #evening# on the terrace after supper
but it a misfortune to be broad without a special genius why you used to reproach me with breadth who knows perhaps we were talking at the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan
there are no sacred traditions amongst us especially in the educated class $avdotya_romanovna$ at the best someone will make them up somehow for himself out of books or from some old chronicle
but those are for the most part the learned and all old fogeys so that it would be almost ill bred in a #man# of society
you know my opinions in general though i never blame #anyone# i do nothing at all i persevere in that but we ve talked of this more than once before
i was so happy indeed as to interest you in my opinions you are very pale $avdotya_romanovna$ i know his theory
i read that article of his about #man# to whom all is permitted $mr_razumihin$ brought it to me $mr_razumihin$ your brother article
in a magazine is there such an article i didnt know it must be interesting but where are you going $avdotya_romanovna$
i want to see $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ $dounia$ articulated faintly how do i go to her she has come in perhaps
i must see her at once perhaps she $avdotya_romanovna$ could not finish her breath literally failed her $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ will not be back till night at least i believe not
she was to have been back at once but if not then she will not be in till quite late ah then you are lying
i see you were lying lying all the time i dont believe you i dont believe you cried $dounia$ completely losing her #head#
almost fainting she sank on to a chair which $mr_svidrigaïlov$ made haste to give her $avdotya_romanovna$ what is it
control yourself here is some water drink a little he sprinkled some water over her $dounia$ shuddered and came to herself
it has acted violently $mr_svidrigaïlov$ muttered to himself frowning $avdotya_romanovna$ calm yourself believe me he has #friend# we will save him
would you like me to take him abroad i have money i can get a ticket in three #day# and as for the murder he will do all sorts of good deeds yet to atone for it
calm yourself he may become a great #man# yet well how are you how do you feel cruel #man# to be able to jeer at it
let me go where are you going to him where is he do you know why is this #door# locked we came in at that #door# and now it is locked
when did you manage to lock it we couldnt be shouting all over the flat on such a subject i am far from jeering it simply that i sick of talking like this
but how can you go in such a state do you want to betray him you will drive him to fury and he will give himself up
let me tell you he is already being watched they are already on his track you will simply be giving him away
wait a little i saw him and was talking to him just now he can still be saved wait a bit sit down let us think it over together
i asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to consider it thoroughly but do sit down
it all depends on you on you on you alone he began with glowing eyes almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for emotion
how can you save him can he really be saved $dounia$ sat down $mr_svidrigaïlov$ sat down beside her $dounia$ drew back from him in alarm
he too was trembling all over you one word from you and he is saved i i ll save him i have money and #friend#
i ll send him away at once i ll get a passport two passports one for him and one for me i have #friend#
capable people if you like i ll take a passport for you for your #mother# what do you want with $mr_razumihin$ i love you too
i love you beyond everything let me kiss the hem of your dress let me let me the very rustle of it is too much for me
tell me do that and i ll do it i ll do everything i will do the impossible what you believe i will believe
i ll do anything anything dont dont look at me like that do you know that you are killing me he was almost beginning to rave
#something# seemed suddenly to go to his #head# $dounia$ jumped up and rushed to the #door# open it open it
she called shaking the #door# open it is there no one there $mr_svidrigaïlov$ got up and came to himself his still trembling lips slowly broke into an angry mocking smile
there is no one at home he said quietly and emphatically the landlady has gone out and it waste of time to shout like that
you are only exciting yourself uselessly where is the key open the #door# at once at once base #man# i have lost the key and cannot find it
this is an outrage cried $dounia$ turning pale as death she rushed to the furthest #corner# where she made haste to barricade herself with a little table
she did not scream but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched every movement he made $mr_svidrigaïlov$ remained standing at the other #end# of the room facing her
he was positively composed at least in appearance but his face was pale as before the mocking smile did not leave his face
you spoke of outrage just now $avdotya_romanovna$ in that case you may be sure i ve taken measures $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ is not at home
the kapernaumovs are far away there are five locked rooms between i am at least twice as strong as you are and i have nothing to fear besides
for you could not complain afterwards you surely would not be willing actually to betray your brother besides no one would believe you
how should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary #man# in his lodgings so that even if you do sacrifice your brother you could prove nothing
it is very difficult to prove an assault $avdotya_romanovna$ scoundrel whispered $dounia$ indignantly as you like but observe i was only speaking by way of a general proposition
i only spoke to show you that you need have no remorse even if you were willing to save your brother of your own accord as i suggest to you
it my personal conviction that you are perfectly right violence is hateful you would be simply submitting to circumstances to violence in fact if we must use that word
think about it your brother and your #mother# fate are in your #hand# i will be your slave all my life
i will wait here $mr_svidrigaïlov$ sat down on the sofa about eight #step# from $dounia$ she had not the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination
besides she knew him suddenly she pulled out of her #pocket# a revolver cocked it and laid it in her #hand# on the table
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ jumped up aha so that it is it he cried surprised but smiling maliciously well that completely alters the aspect of affairs
you ve made things wonderfully easier for me $avdotya_romanovna$ but where did you get the revolver was it $mr_razumihin$ why it my revolver an old #friend#
and how i ve hunted for it the shooting lessons i ve given you in the country have not been thrown away
it not your revolver it belonged to $marfa_petrovna$ whom you killed wretch there was nothing of yours in her house
i took it when i began to suspect what you were capable of if you dare to advance one #step# i swear i ll kill you
she was frantic but your brother i ask from curiosity said $mr_svidrigaïlov$ still standing where he was inform if you want to
dont stir dont come nearer i ll shoot you poisoned your wife i know you are a murderer yourself she held the revolver ready
are you so positive i poisoned $marfa_petrovna$ you did you hinted it yourself you talked to me of poison
i know you went to get it you had it in readiness it was your doing it must have been your doing scoundrel
even if that were true it would have been for your sake you would have been the cause you are lying
i hated you always always oho $avdotya_romanovna$ you seem to have forgotten how you softened to me in the heat of propaganda
i saw it in your eyes do you remember that moonlight night when the nightingale was singing that a lie there was a flash of fury in $dounia$ eyes that a lie and a libel
a lie well if you like it a lie i made it up women ought not to be reminded of such things he smiled
$dounia$ raised the revolver and deadly pale gazed at him measuring the distance and awaiting the first movement on his part
i know you will shoot you pretty wild creature well shoot away her lower lip was white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire
the fire glowing in her eyes at the moment she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of anguish in his heart
he had never seen her so handsome he took a #step# forward and a shot rang out the bullet grazed his hair and flew into the #wall# behind
he stood still and laughed softly the wasp has stung me she aimed straight at my #head# what this blood
he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood which flowed in a thin stream down his right temple the bullet seemed to have just grazed the skin
$dounia$ lowered the revolver and looked at $mr_svidrigaïlov$ not so much in terror as in a sort of wild amazement she seemed not to understand what she was doing and what was going on
well you missed fire again i ll wait said $mr_svidrigaïlov$ softly still smiling but gloomily if you go on like that i shall have time to seize you before you cock again
$dounia$ started quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it let me be she cried in despair i swear i ll shoot again
i i ll kill you well at three paces you can hardly help it but if you dont then his eyes flashed and he took two #step# forward
$dounia$ shot again it missed fire you havent loaded it properly never mind you have another charge there get it ready i ll wait
he stood facing her two paces away waiting and gazing at her with wild determination with feverishly passionate stubborn set eyes
$dounia$ saw that he would sooner die than let her go and now of course she would kill him at two paces
a weight seemed to have rolled from his heart perhaps not only the fear of death indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment
suddenly she flung away the revolver she dropped it said $mr_svidrigaïlov$ with surprise and he drew a deep breath it was the deliverance from another feeling darker and more bitter which he could not himself have defined
he went to $dounia$ and gently put his arm round her waist she did not resist but trembling like a leaf looked at him with suppliant eyes
he tried to say #something# but his lips moved without being able to utter a sound let me go $dounia$ implored
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ shuddered her voice now was quite different then you dont love me he asked softly $dounia$ shook her #head#
and and you cant never he whispered in despair never there followed a moment of terrible dumb struggle in the heart of $mr_svidrigaïlov$
he looked at her with an indescribable gaze suddenly he withdrew his arm turned quickly to the window and stood facing it
he took it out of the left #pocket# of his coat and laid it on the table behind him without turning or looking at $dounia$
another moment passed here the key take it make haste he looked stubbornly out of the window $dounia$ went up to the table to take the key
make haste make haste repeated $mr_svidrigaïlov$ still without turning or moving but there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that make haste
$dounia$ understood it snatched up the key flew to the #door# unlocked it quickly and rushed out of the room
a minute later beside herself she ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of bridge $mr_svidrigaïlov$ remained three minutes standing at the window
at last he slowly turned looked about him and passed his #hand# over his forehead a strange smile contorted his face a pitiful sad weak smile a smile of despair
the blood which was already getting dry smeared his #hand# he looked angrily at it then wetted a towel and washed his temple
the revolver which $dounia$ had flung away lay near the #door# and suddenly caught his eye he picked it up and examined it
it was a little #pocket# three barrel revolver of old fashioned construction there were still two charges and one capsule left in it
it could be fired again he #thought# a little put the revolver in his #pocket# took his hat and went out
chapter vi he spent that #evening# till ten clock going from one low haunt to another katia too turned up and sang another gutter song how a certain villain and tyrant began kissing katia
he was particularly drawn to these clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses one bent to the left and the other to the right
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ treated katia and the organ grinder and some singers and the waiters and two little clerks they took him finally to a pleasure garden where he paid for their entrance
there was one lanky three year old pine tree and three bushes in the garden besides a vauxhall which was in reality a drinking bar where tea too was served and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it
a chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed german clown from munich with a red nose entertained the public
he listened to them for a quarter of an hour but they shouted so loud that there was no possibility of understanding them
the only fact that seemed certain was that one of them had stolen #something# and had even succeeded in selling it on the spot to a jew but would not share the spoil with his companion
the clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent $mr_svidrigaïlov$ was chosen to decide the dispute finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon belonging to the vauxhall
it was missed and the affair began to seem troublesome $mr_svidrigaïlov$ paid for the spoon got up and walked out of the garden
he had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than anything
it was about six clock it was a dark and stifling #evening# threatening storm clouds came over the sky about ten clock
there was a clap of thunder and the rain came down like a waterfall the water fell not in drops but beat on the earth in streams
drenched to the skin he went home locked himself in opened the bureau took out all his money and tore up two or three papers
then putting the money in his #pocket# he was about to change his clothes but looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the rain he gave up the idea took up his hat and went out of the room without locking the #door#
there were flashes of lightning every minute and each flash lasted while one could count five he went straight to $sonia$
she was at home she was not alone the four kapernaumov #child# were with her she was giving them tea she received $mr_svidrigaïlov$ in respectful silence looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes
the #child# all ran away at once in indescribable terror $mr_svidrigaïlov$ sat down at the table and asked $sonia$ to sit beside him
i may be going to america $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ said $mr_svidrigaïlov$ and as i am probably seeing you for the last time i have come to make some arrangements
she timidly prepared to listen well did you see the lady to #day# i know what she said to you you need not tell me
as to your sisters and your brother they are really provided for and the money assigned to them i ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments
$sonia$ made a movement and blushed those people have their own way of doing things you had better take charge of the receipts in case anything happens
take those for yourself entirely for yourself and let that be strictly between ourselves so that no one knows of it whatever you hear
you will need the money for to go on living in the old way $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ is bad and besides there is no need for it now
i am so much indebted to you and so are the #child# and my stepmother said $sonia$ hurriedly and if i ve said so little please dont consider
here take them well now that settled here are three per cent bonds to the value of three thousand #rouble#
that enough that enough but as for the money $arkady_ivanovitch_svidrigaïlov$ i am very grateful to you but i dont need it now
i can always earn my own living dont think me ungrateful if you are so charitable that money it for you for you $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ and please dont waste words over it
i havent time for it you will want it $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ has two alternatives a bullet in the brain or siberia
$sonia$ looked wildly at him and started dont be uneasy i know all about it from himself and i am not a gossip i wont tell #anyone#
it was good advice when you told him to give himself up and confess it would be much better for him
well if it turns out to be siberia he will go and you will follow him that so isnt it and if so you ll need money
you ll need it for him do you understand giving it to you is the same as my giving it to him
besides you promised amalia $katerina_ivanovna$ to pay what owing i heard you how can you undertake such obligations so heedlessly $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$
it was $katerina_ivanovna$ debt and not yours so you ought not to have taken any notice of the german woman
if you are ever questioned about me to morrow or the #day# after you will be asked dont say anything about my coming to see you now and dont show the money to #anyone# or say a word about it
you cant get through the world like that well now good bye he got up my greetings to $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$
by the way you better put the money for the present in $mr_razumihin$ keeping you know $mr_razumihin$ of course you do
he not a bad fellow take it to him to morrow or when the time comes and till then hide it carefully
she longed to speak to ask a question but for the first moments she did not dare and did not know how to begin
$sonia$ too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at $mr_svidrigaïlov$ how can you how can you be going now in such rain
why be starting for america and be stopped by rain ha ha good bye $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ my dear live and live long you will be of use to others
by the way tell $mr_razumihin$ i send my greetings to him tell him $arkady_ivanovitch_svidrigaïlov$ $mr_svidrigaïlov$ sends his greetings be sure to
he went out leaving $sonia$ in a state of wondering anxiety and vague apprehension it appeared afterwards that on the same #evening# at twenty past eleven he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit
drenched to the skin he walked into the little flat where the parents of his betrothed lived in third #street# in vassilyevsky island
he knocked some time before he was admitted and his visit at first caused great perturbation but $mr_svidrigaïlov$ could be very fascinating when he liked so that the first and indeed very intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that $mr_svidrigaïlov$ had probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing vanished immediately
the decrepit father was wheeled in to see $mr_svidrigaïlov$ by the tender and sensible #mother# who as usual began the conversation with various irrelevant questions
she never asked a direct question but began by smiling and rubbing her #hand# and then if she were obliged to ascertain #something# for instance when $mr_svidrigaïlov$ would like to have the wedding she would begin by interested and almost eager questions about paris and the court life there and only by degrees brought the conversation round to third #street#
on other occasions this had of course been very impressive but this time $arkady_ivanovitch_svidrigaïlov$ seemed particularly impatient and insisted on seeing his betrothed at once though he had been informed to begin with that she had already gone to bed
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ informed her at once that he was obliged by very important affairs to leave petersburg for a time and therefore brought her fifteen thousand #rouble# and begged her accept them as a present from him as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present before their wedding
the logical connection of the present with his immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear
but it all went off very well even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained
on the other #hand# the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced by tears from the most sensible of #mother#
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ got up laughed kissed his betrothed patted her cheek declared he would soon come back and noticing in her eyes together with childish curiosity a sort of earnest dumb inquiry reflected and kissed her again though he felt sincere anger inwardly at the #thought# that his present would be immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of #mother#
he went away leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement but the tender mamma speaking quietly in a half whisper settled some of the most important of their doubts concluding that $mr_svidrigaïlov$ was a great #man# a #man# of great affairs and connections and of great wealth there was no knowing what he had in his mind
he would start off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him so that there was nothing surprising about it
of course it was strange that he was wet through but englishmen for instance are even more eccentric and all these people of high society didnt think of what was said of them and didnt stand on ceremony
the rain still persisted the girl of course appeared possibly indeed he came like that on purpose to show that he was not afraid of #anyone#
above all not a word should be said about it for god knows what might come of it and the money must be locked up and it was most fortunate that fedosya the cook had not left the kitchen
and above all not a word must be said to that old cat $madame_resslich$ and so on and so on
they sat up whispering till two clock but the girl went to bed much earlier amazed and rather sorrowful $mr_svidrigaïlov$ meanwhile exactly at midnight crossed the bridge on the way back to the mainland
he began shivering and for one moment he gazed at the black waters of the little neva with a look of special interest even inquiry
the rain had ceased and there was a roaring wind but he soon felt it very cold standing by the water he turned and went towards prospect
he walked along that endless #street# for a long time almost half an hour more than once stumbling in the dark on the wooden pavement but continually looking for #something# on the right side of the #street#
he had noticed passing through this #street# lately that there was a hotel somewhere towards the #end# built of wood but fairly large and its name he remembered was #something# like adrianople
he was not mistaken the hotel was so conspicuous in that god forsaken place that he could not fail to see it even in the dark
it was a long blackened wooden building and in #spite# of the late hour there were lights in the windows and signs of life within
the latter scanning $mr_svidrigaïlov$ pulled himself together and led him at once to a close and tiny room in the distance at the #end# of the corridor under the stairs
he went in and asked a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room there was no other all were occupied
the ragged fellow looked inquiringly is there tea asked $mr_svidrigaïlov$ yes sir what else is there veal vodka savouries
bring me tea and veal and you want nothing else he asked with apparent surprise nothing nothing
the ragged #man# went away completely disillusioned it must be a nice place #thought# $mr_svidrigaïlov$ how was it
i didnt know it i expect i look as if i came from a café chantant and have had some adventure on the way
it would be interesting to know who stayed here he lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully it was a room
it had one window the bed which was very dirty and the plain stained chair and table almost filled it up
the #wall# looked as though they were made of planks covered with shabby paper so torn and dusty that the pattern was indistinguishable though the general colour yellow could still be made out
one of the #wall# was cut short by the sloping ceiling though the room was not an attic but just under the stairs
so low pitched that $mr_svidrigaïlov$ could only just stand up in it $mr_svidrigaïlov$ set down the candle sat down on the bed and sank into #thought#
but a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout in the next room attracted his attention the murmur had not ceased from the moment he entered the room
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ got up shaded the light with his #hand# and at once he saw light through a crack in the #wall# he went up and peeped through
he listened someone was upbraiding and almost tearfully scolding but he heard only one voice the room which was somewhat larger than his had two occupants
one of them a very curly headed #man# with a red inflamed face was standing in the pose of an orator without his coat with his legs wide apart to preserve his balance and smiting himself on the breast
he declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn him out when he liked and that only the finger of providence sees it all
the object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair and had the air of a #man# who wants dreadfully to sneeze but cant
he sometimes turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker but obviously had not the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it
a candle was burning down on the table there were wine glasses a nearly empty bottle of vodka bread and cucumber and glasses with the dregs of stale tea
he reproached the other with being a beggar with having no standing whatever after gazing attentively at this $mr_svidrigaïlov$ turned away indifferently and sat down on the bed
the ragged attendant returning with the tea could not resist asking him again whether he didnt want anything more and again receiving a negative reply finally withdrew
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ made haste to drink a glass of tea to warm himself but could not eat anything he began to feel feverish
he took off his coat and wrapping himself in the blanket lay down on the bed he was annoyed it would have been better to be well for the occasion he #thought# with a smile
the room was close the candle burnt dimly the wind was roaring outside he heard a mouse scratching in the #corner# and the room smelt of mice and of leather
he lay in a sort of reverie one #thought# followed another he felt a longing to fix his imagination on #something#
it must be a garden under the window he #thought# there a sound of trees how i dislike the sound of trees on a stormy night in the dark
they give one a horrid feeling he remembered how he had disliked it when he passed petrovsky park just now
this reminded him of the bridge over the little neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there
i never have liked water he #thought# even in a landscape and he suddenly smiled again at a strange idea
surely now all these questions of taste and comfort ought not to matter but i ve become more particular like an animal that picks out a special place for such an occasion
i ought to have gone into the petrovsky park i suppose it seemed dark cold ha ha as though i were seeking pleasant sensations
by the way why havent i put out the candle he blew it out they ve gone to bed next #door# he #thought# not seeing the light at the crack
well now $marfa_petrovna$ now is the time for you to turn up it dark and the very time and place for you
he suddenly recalled how an hour before carrying out his design on $dounia$ he had recommended $mr_raskolnikov$ to trust her to $mr_razumihin$ keeping
but now you wont come i suppose i really did say it as $mr_raskolnikov$ guessed to tease myself
but what a rogue that $mr_raskolnikov$ is he gone through a good deal he may be a successful rogue in time when he got over his nonsense
but now he too eager for life these young #man# are contemptible on that #point# but hang the fellow let him please himself it nothing to do with me
he could not get to sleep by degrees $dounia$ image rose before him and a shudder ran over him
no i must give up all that now he #thought# rousing himself i must think of #something# else it queer and funny
i never had a great hatred for #anyone# i never particularly desired to avenge myself even and that a bad sign a bad sign a bad sign
i never liked quarrelling either and never lost my #temper# that a bad sign too and the promises i made her just now too damnation
but who knows perhaps she would have made a new #man# of me somehow he ground his teeth and sank into silence again
again $dounia$ image rose before him just as she was when after shooting the first time she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him so that he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a #hand# to defend herself if he had not reminded her
he recalled how at that instant he felt almost sorry for her how he had felt a pang at his heart
he was dozing off the feverish shiver had ceased when suddenly #something# seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes
aïe damnation these #thought# again i must put it away he started ugh hang it i believe it a mouse he #thought# that the veal i left on the table
he felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the blanket get up get cold but all at once #something# unpleasant ran over his leg again
he pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle shaking with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed there was nothing
he tried to catch it but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without leaving the bed slipped between his fingers ran over his #hand# and suddenly darted under the pillow
he threw down the pillow but in one instant felt #something# leap on his chest and dart over his body and down his back under his shirt
he shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet he trembled nervously and woke up the room was dark
he was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket as before the wind was howling under the window
how disgusting he #thought# with annoyance he got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the window
there was a cold damp draught from the window however without getting up he drew the blanket over him and wrapped himself in it
it better not to sleep at all he decided he was not thinking of anything and did not want to think
but one image rose after another incoherent scraps of #thought# without beginning or #end# passed through his mind he sank into drowsiness
perhaps the cold or the dampness or the dark or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic
he kept dwelling on images of flowers he fancied a charming flower garden a bright warm almost hot #day# a holiday trinity #day#
a fine sumptuous country cottage in the english taste overgrown with fragrant flowers with flower beds going round the house the porch wreathed in climbers was surrounded with beds of roses
he noticed particularly in the windows nosegays of tender white heavily fragrant narcissus bending over their bright green thick long stalks
he was reluctant to move away from them but he went up the stairs and came into a large high drawing room and again everywhere at the windows the #door# on to the balcony and on the balcony itself were flowers
the floors were strewn with freshly cut fragrant hay the windows were open a fresh cool light air came into the room
the birds were chirruping under the window and in the middle of the room on a table covered with a white satin shroud stood a coffin
the coffin was covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill wreaths of flowers surrounded it on all sides
among the flowers lay a girl in a white muslin dress with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom as though carved out of marble
a light cool #staircase# carpeted with rich rugs was decorated with rare plants in china pots but her loose fair hair was wet there was a wreath of roses on her #head#
the stern and already rigid profile of her face looked as though chiselled of marble too and the smile on her pale lips was full of an immense unchildish #misery# and sorrowful appeal
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ knew that girl there was no holy image no burning candle beside the coffin no sound of prayers the girl had drowned herself
and she had destroyed herself crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish soul had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn from her a last scream of despair unheeded and brutally disregarded on a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled
she was only fourteen but her heart was broken $mr_svidrigaïlov$ came to himself got up from the bed and went to the window
the wind lashed furiously into the little room and stung his face and his chest only covered with his shirt as though with frost
he felt for the latch and opened it under the window there must have been #something# like a garden and apparently a pleasure garden
now drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes it was dark as in a cellar so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of objects
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ bending down with elbows on the window sill gazed for five minutes into the darkness the boom of a cannon followed by a second one resounded in the darkness of the night
there too probably there were tea tables and singing in the daytime ah the signal the river is overflowing he #thought#
the cellar rats will swim out and #man# will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys
by morning it will be swirling down the #street# in the lower parts flooding the basements and cellars what time is it now
and he had hardly #thought# it when somewhere near a clock on the #wall# ticking away hurriedly struck three aha
i ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain so that as soon as one shoulder touches it millions of drops drip on one #head#
he moved away from the window shut it lighted the candle put on his waistcoat his overcoat and his hat and went out carrying the candle into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in the midst of candle #end# and all sorts of rubbish to pay him for the room and leave the hotel
it will be light in an hour why wait i ll go out at once straight to the park it the best minute i couldnt choose a better
he walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding #anyone# and was just going to call out when suddenly in a dark #corner# between an old cupboard and the #door# he caught sight of a strange object which seemed to be alive
he bent down with the candle and saw a little girl not more than five years old shivering and crying with her clothes as wet as a soaking house flannel
she did not seem afraid of $mr_svidrigaïlov$ but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big black eyes
now and then she sobbed as #child# do when they have been crying a long time but are beginning to be comforted
the #child# face was pale and tired she was numb with cold how can she have come here she must have hidden here and not slept all night
the #child# suddenly becoming animated chattered away in her baby language #something# about mammy and that mammy would beat her and about some cup that she had bwoken
he could only guess from what she said that she was a neglected #child# whose #mother# probably a drunken cook in the service of the hotel whipped and frightened her that the #child# had broken a cup of her #mother# and was so frightened that she had run away the #evening# before had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the rain at last had made her way in here hidden behind the cupboard and spent the night there crying and trembling from the damp the darkness and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it
he began questioning her the #child# chattered on without stopping he took her in his arms went back to his room sat her on the bed and began undressing her
the torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night
when he had undressed her he put her on the bed covered her up and wrapped her in the blanket from her #head# downwards
she fell asleep at once then he sank into dreary musing again what folly to trouble myself he decided suddenly with an oppressive feeling of annoyance
in vexation he took up the candle to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away
what idiocy damn the #child# he #thought# as he opened the #door# but he turned again to see whether the #child# was asleep
he raised the blanket carefully the #child# was sleeping soundly she had got warm under the blanket and her pale cheeks were flushed
but strange to say that flush seemed brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood it a flush of fever #thought# $mr_svidrigaïlov$
it was like the flush from drinking as though she had been given a full glass to drink her crimson lips were hot and glowing but what was this
he suddenly fancied that her long black eyelashes were quivering as though the lids were opening and a sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink as though the little girl were not asleep but pretending
yes it was so her lips parted in a smile the #corner# of her mouth quivered as though she were trying to control them
now it was a grin a broad grin there was #something# shameless provocative in that quite unchildish face it was depravity it was the face of a harlot the shameless face of a french harlot
but now she quite gave up all effort now both eyes opened wide they turned a glowing shameless glance upon him they laughed invited him
there was #something# infinitely hideous and shocking in that laugh in those eyes in such nastiness in the face of a #child#
what at five years old $mr_svidrigaïlov$ muttered in genuine horror what does it mean and now she turned to him her little face all aglow holding out her arms
accursed #child# $mr_svidrigaïlov$ cried raising his #hand# to strike her but at that moment he woke up he was in the same bed still wrapped in the blanket
the candle had not been lighted and daylight was streaming in at the windows i ve had nightmare all night
he got up angrily feeling utterly shattered his bones ached there was a thick mist outside and he could see nothing
feeling the revolver in his #pocket# and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few lines in large letters
reading them over he sank into #thought# with his flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal which was still on the table
it was nearly five he had overslept himself he got up put on his still damp jacket and overcoat he stared at them and at last with his free right #hand# began trying to catch one
at last realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit he started got up and walked resolutely out of the room
he tried till he was tired but could not catch it a minute later he was in the #street# a thick milky mist hung over the town
he was picturing the waters of the little neva swollen in the night petrovsky island the wet paths the wet grass the wet trees and bushes and at last the bush
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ walked along the slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the little neva he began ill humouredly staring at the houses trying to think of #something# else
there was not a cabman or a passer by in the #street# the bright yellow wooden little houses looked dirty and dejected with their closed shutters
the cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he began to shiver from time to time he came across shop signs and read each carefully
at last he reached the #end# of the wooden pavement and came to a big stone house a dirty shivering dog crossed his path with its tail between its legs
a #man# in a greatcoat lay face downwards dead drunk across the pavement he looked at him and went on a high tower stood up on the left
bah he shouted here is a place why should it be petrovsky it will be in the presence of an official witness anyway
he almost smiled at this new #thought# and turned into the #street# where there was the big house with the tower
at the great closed gates of the house a little #man# stood with his shoulder leaning against them wrapped in a grey soldier coat with a copper achilles helmet on his #head#
his face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection which is so sourly printed on all faces of jewish race without exception
he cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at $mr_svidrigaïlov$ they both $mr_svidrigaïlov$ and achilles stared at each other for a few minutes without speaking
at last it struck achilles as irregular for a #man# not drunk to be standing three #step# from him staring and not saying a word
what do you want here he said without moving or changing his position nothing brother good morning answered $mr_svidrigaïlov$
this isnt the place i am going to foreign parts brother to foreign parts to america america $mr_svidrigaïlov$ took out the revolver and cocked it
achilles raised his eyebrows i say this is not the place for such jokes why shouldnt it be the place
because it isnt well brother i dont mind that it a good place when you are asked you just say he was going he said to america
he put the revolver to his right temple you cant do it here it not the place cried achilles rousing himself his eyes growing bigger and bigger
the same #day# about seven clock in the #evening# $mr_raskolnikov$ was on his way to his #mother# and sister lodging the lodging in bakaleyev house which $mr_razumihin$ had found for them
$mr_svidrigaïlov$ pulled the trigger chapter vii the stairs went up from the #street# $mr_raskolnikov$ walked with lagging #step# as though still hesitating whether to go or not
but nothing would have turned him back his decision was taken besides it doesnt matter they still know nothing he #thought# and they are used to thinking of me as eccentric
he was appallingly dressed his clothes torn and dirty soaked with a night rain his face was almost distorted from fatigue exposure the inward conflict that had lasted for twenty four hours
he had spent all the previous night alone god knows where but anyway he had reached a decision he knocked at the #door# which was opened by his #mother#
at first $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was speechless with joy and surprise then she took him by the #hand# and drew him into the room
$dounia$ was not at home even the servant happened to be out here you are she began faltering with joy
dont be angry with me $rodya$ for welcoming you so foolishly with tears i am laughing not crying did you think i was crying
no i am delighted but i ve got into such a stupid habit of shedding tears i ve been like that ever since your father death
i cry for anything sit down dear boy you must be tired i see you are ah how muddy you are
no no $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ hurriedly interrupted you #thought# i was going to cross question you in the womanish way i used to dont be anxious
i was in the rain yesterday #mother# $mr_raskolnikov$ began i understand i understand it all now i ve learned the ways here
i ve made up my mind once for all how could i understand your plans and expect you to give an account of them
god knows what concerns and plans you may have or what ideas you are hatching so it not for me to keep nudging your elbow asking you what you are thinking about
and truly i see for myself that they are better but my goodness why am i running to and fro as though i were crazy
i am reading your article in the magazine for the third time $rodya$ $dmitri_prokofitch$ brought it to me directly i saw it i cried out to myself there foolish one
he may have some new ideas in his #head# just now he is thinking them over and i worry him and upset him
i read it my dear and of course there was a great deal i did not understand but that only natural how should i
i #thought# that what he is busy about that the solution of the mystery learned people are always like that show me #mother#
incongruous as it was with his mood and his circumstances he felt that strange and bitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he sees himself in print besides he was only twenty three
$mr_raskolnikov$ took the magazine and glanced at his article it lasted only a moment after reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed with anguish
he recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding months he flung the article on the table with disgust and anger
but however foolish i may be $rodya$ i can see for myself that you will very soon be one of the leading if not the leading #man# in the world of russian #thought#
and they dared to think you were mad you dont know but they really #thought# that ah the despicable creatures how could they understand genius
the first time poems i ve got the manuscript and will show you and the second time a whole novel i begged him to let me copy it out and how we prayed that they should be taken they werent
i was breaking my heart $rodya$ six or seven #day# ago over your food and your clothes and the way you are living
but now i see again how foolish i was for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and talent
and $dounia$ dounia was all but believing it what do you say to that your father sent twice to magazines no doubt you dont care about that for the present and you are occupied with much more important matters
$dounia$ not at home #mother# no $rodya$ i often dont see her she leaves me alone $dmitri_prokofitch$ comes to see me it so good of him and he always talks about you
he loves you and respects you my dear i dont say that $dounia$ is very wanting in consideration i am not complaining
she has her ways and i have mine she seems to have got some secrets of late and i never have any secrets from you two
of course i am sure that $dounia$ has far too much sense and besides she loves you and me but i dont know what it will all lead to
you ve made me so happy by coming now $rodya$ but she has missed you by going out when she comes in i ll tell her your brother came in while you were out
you mustnt spoil me $rodya$ you know come when you can but if you cant it doesnt matter i can wait
where have you been all this time i shall know anyway that you are fond of me that will be enough for me
i shall read what you write i shall hear about you from everyone and sometimes you ll come yourself to see me
what could be better here you ve come now to comfort your #mother# i see that here $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ began to cry
here i am again dont mind my foolishness my goodness why am i sitting here she cried jumping up
there is coffee and i dont offer you any ah that the selfishness of old age i ll get it at once
#mother# dont trouble i am going at once i havent come for that please listen to me $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ went up to him timidly
#mother# whatever happens whatever you hear about me whatever you are told about me will you always love me as you do now
he asked suddenly from the fullness of his heart as though not thinking of his words and not weighing them
$rodya$ rodya what is the matter how can you ask me such a question why who will tell me anything about you
i ve come to assure you that i ve always loved you and i am glad that we are alone even glad $dounia$ is out he went on with the same impulse
i have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy you must believe that your son loves you now more than himself and that all you #thought# about me that i was cruel and didnt care about you was all a mistake
besides i shouldnt believe #anyone# i should refuse to listen i shall never cease to love you well that enough i #thought# i must do this and begin with this
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ embraced him in silence pressing him to her bosom and weeping gently i dont know what is wrong with you $rodya$ she said at last
i ve been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now i see that there is a great sorrow in store for you and that why you are miserable
i ve foreseen it a long time $rodya$ forgive me for speaking about it i keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights
your sister lay talking in her sleep all last night talking of nothing but you i caught #something# but i couldnt make it out
i felt all the morning as though i were going to be hanged waiting for #something# expecting #something# and now it has come
$rodya$ rodya where are you going you are going away somewhere yes that what i #thought# i can come with you you know if you need me
and $dounia$ too she loves you she loves you dearly and $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ may come with us if you like you see i am glad to look upon her as a daughter even
$dmitri_prokofitch$ will help us to go together but where are you going good bye #mother# what to #day# she cried as though losing him for ever
i cant stay i must go now and cant i come with you no but kneel down and pray to god for me
your prayer perhaps will reach him let me bless you and sign you with the cross that right that right
yes he was glad he was very glad that there was no one there that he was alone with his #mother#
oh god what are we doing for the first time after all those awful months his heart was softened he fell down before her he kissed her feet and both wept embracing
for some #day# she had realised that #something# awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had come for him
and she was not surprised and did not question him this time $rodya$ my darling my first born she said sobbing now you are just as when you were little
you would run like this to me and hug me and kiss me when your father was living and we were poor you comforted us simply by being with us
and when i buried your father how often we wept together at his grave and embraced as now and if i ve been crying lately it that my #mother# heart had a foreboding of trouble
the first time i saw you that #evening# you remember as soon as we arrived here i guessed simply from your eyes
my heart sank at once and to #day# when i opened the #door# and looked at you i #thought# the fatal hour had come
$rodya$ rodya you are not going away to #day# no you ll come again yes i ll come $rodya$ dont be angry i dont dare to question you
i know i mustnt only say two words to me is it far where you are going very far what is awaiting you there
some post or career for you what god sends only pray for me $mr_raskolnikov$ went to the #door# but she clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes
her face worked with terror enough #mother# said $mr_raskolnikov$ deeply regretting that he had come not for ever it not yet for ever
you ll come you ll come to morrow i will i will good bye he tore himself away at last it was a warm fresh bright #evening# it had cleared up in the morning
$mr_raskolnikov$ went to his lodgings he made haste he wanted to finish all before sunset he did not want to meet #anyone# till then
going up the stairs he noticed that $nastasya$ rushed from the samovar to watch him intently can #anyone# have come to see me
he wondered he had a disgusted vision of $porfiry_petrovitch$ but opening his #door# he saw $dounia$ she was sitting alone plunged in deep #thought# and looked as though she had been waiting a long time
he stopped short in the doorway she rose from the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him her eyes fixed upon him betrayed horror and infinite grief
and from those eyes alone he saw at once that she knew am i to come in or go away
he asked uncertainly i ve been all #day# with $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ we were both waiting for you we #thought# that you would be sure to come there
i feel weak $dounia$ i am very tired and i should have liked at this moment to be able to control myself
$mr_raskolnikov$ went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair he glanced at her mistrustfully where were you all night
you see sister i wanted to make up my mind once for all and several times i walked by the neva i remember that i wanted to #end# it all there
i dont remember clearly but i couldnt make up my mind he whispered looking at her mistrustfully again thank god that was just what we were afraid of $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ and i
then you still have faith in life thank god thank god $mr_raskolnikov$ smiled bitterly i havent faith but i have just been weeping in #mother# arms
i havent faith but i have just asked her to pray for me i dont know how it is $dounia$ i dont understand it
have you been at #mother# have you told her cried $dounia$ horror stricken surely you havent done that no i didnt tell her in words but she understood a great deal
she heard you talking in your sleep i am sure she half understands it already perhaps i did wrong in going to see her
i dont know why i did go i am a contemptible person $dounia$ a contemptible person but ready to face suffering
yes to escape the disgrace i #thought# of drowning myself $dounia$ but as i looked into the water i #thought# that if i had considered myself strong till now i better not be afraid of disgrace he said hurrying on
there was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes he seemed to be glad to think that he was still proud
you are arent you yes i am going at once it pride $dounia$ pride $rodya$ you dont think sister that i was simply afraid of the water
he asked looking into her face with a sinister smile oh $rodya$ hush cried $dounia$ bitterly silence lasted for two minutes
he sat with his eyes fixed on the floor $dounia$ stood at the other #end# of the table and looked at him with anguish
suddenly he got up it late it time to go i am going at once to give myself up but i dont know why i am going to give myself up
big tears fell down her cheeks you are crying sister but can you hold out your #hand# to me
you doubted it she threw her arms round him arent you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering she cried holding him close and kissing him
crime what crime he cried in sudden fury that i killed a vile noxious insect an old pawnbroker woman of use to no one
i am not thinking of it and i am not thinking of expiating it and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides
killing her was atonement for forty sins she was sucking the life out of poor people was that a crime a crime a crime
it simply because i am contemptible and have nothing in me that i have decided to perhaps too for my advantage as that
only now i see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice now that i have decided to face this superfluous disgrace $porfiry_petrovitch$ suggested
which all #man# shed he put in almost frantically which flows and has always flowed in streams which is spilt like champagne and for which #man# are crowned in the capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of mankind
brother brother what are you saying why you have shed blood cried $dounia$ in despair look into it more carefully and understand it
i too wanted to do good to #man# and would have done hundreds thousands of good deeds to make up for that one piece of stupidity not stupidity even simply clumsiness for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now that it has failed
by that stupidity i only wanted to put myself into an independent position to take the first #step# to obtain means and then everything would have been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison
everything seems stupid when it fails but i i couldnt carry out even the first #step# because i am contemptible that what the matter
and yet i wont look at it as you do if i had succeeded i should have been crowned with glory but now i trapped
but that not so not so brother what are you saying ah it not picturesque not æsthetically attractive i fail to understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable
i ve never never recognised this more clearly than now and i am further than ever from seeing that what i did was a crime
the fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence i ve never never been stronger and more convinced than now
the colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face but as he uttered his last explanation he happened to meet $dounia$ eyes and he saw such anguish in them that he could not help being checked
he felt that he had anyway made these two poor women miserable that he was anyway the cause $dounia$ darling if i am guilty forgive me though i cannot be forgiven if i am guilty
good bye we wont dispute it time high time to go dont follow me i beseech you i have somewhere else to go
dont leave her at all i left her in a state of anxiety that she is not #fit# to bear she will die or go out of her mind
but you go at once and sit with #mother# i entreat you to it my last request of you be with her
$mr_razumihin$ will be with you i ve been talking to him dont cry about me i ll try to be honest and manly all my life even if i am a murderer
now good bye for the present he concluded hurriedly noticing again a strange expression in $dounia$ eyes at his last words and promises
perhaps i shall some #day# make a name i wont disgrace you you will see i ll still show why are you crying
he went to the table took up a thick dusty book opened it and took from between the pages a little water colour portrait on ivory
it was the portrait of his landlady daughter who had died of fever that strange girl who had wanted to be a nun
for a minute he gazed at the delicate expressive face of his betrothed kissed the portrait and gave it to $dounia$
dont cry dont cry we are not parting for ever ah yes wait a minute i forgotten i used to talk a great deal about it to her only to her he said thoughtfully
dont be uneasy he returned to $dounia$ she was as much opposed to it as you and i am glad that she is gone
the great #point# is that everything now is going to be different is going to be broken in two he cried suddenly returning to his dejection
to her heart i confided much of what has since been so hideously realised everything everything and am i prepared for it
do i want it myself they say it is necessary for me to suffer what the object of these senseless sufferings
shall i know any better what they are for when i am crushed by hardships and idiocy and weak as an old #man# after twenty years penal servitude
and what shall i have to live for then why am i consenting to that life now oh i knew i was contemptible when i stood looking at the neva at daybreak to #day#
at last they both went out it was hard for $dounia$ but she loved him she walked away but after going fifty paces she turned round to look at him again
at the #corner# he too turned and for the last time their eyes met but noticing that she was looking at him he motioned her away with impatience and even vexation and turned the #corner# abruptly
i am wicked i see that he #thought# to himself feeling ashamed a moment later of his angry gesture to $dounia$
he was still in sight but why are they so fond of me if i dont deserve it oh if only i were alone and no one loved me
but i wonder shall i in those fifteen or twenty years grow so meek that i shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word that i am a criminal
and i too had never loved #anyone# nothing of all this would have happened yes that it that it that what they are sending me there for that what they want
look at them running to and fro about the #street# every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at heart and worse still an idiot
he fell to musing by what process it could come to pass that he could be humbled before all of them indiscriminately humbled by conviction
but try to get me off and they be wild with righteous indignation oh how i hate them all and yet why not
it must be so would not twenty years of continual bondage crush him utterly water wears out a stone and why why should he live after that
it was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that question since the previous #evening# but still he went
why should he go now when he knew that it would be so chapter viii when he went into $sonia$ room it was already getting dark
all #day# $sonia$ had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety $dounia$ had been waiting with her she had come to her that morning remembering $mr_svidrigaïlov$ words that $sonia$ knew
we will not describe the conversation and tears of the two girls and how friendly they became $dounia$ gained one comfort at least from that interview that her brother would not be alone
he had gone to her $sonia$ first with his confession he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it she would go with him wherever fate might send him
$dounia$ did not ask but she knew it was so she looked at $sonia$ almost with reverence and at first almost embarrassed her by it
$dounia$ gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at their first meeting in $mr_raskolnikov$ room had remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life
$dounia$ at last became impatient and leaving $sonia$ went to her brother room to await him there she kept thinking that he would come there first
when she had gone $sonia$ began to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide and $dounia$ too feared it
but they had spent the #day# trying to persuade each other that that could not be and both were less anxious while they were together
$sonia$ was almost on the #point# of tears she felt herself on the contrary hardly worthy to look at $dounia$ as soon as they parted each #thought# of nothing else
$sonia$ remembered how $mr_svidrigaïlov$ had said to her the #day# before that $mr_raskolnikov$ had two alternatives siberia or besides she knew his vanity his pride and his lack of faith
is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to make him live she #thought# at last in despair
$sonia$ was standing in dejection looking intently out of the window but from it she could see nothing but the unwhitewashed blank #wall# of the next house
meanwhile the sun was setting at last when she began to feel sure of his death he walked into the room she gave a cry of joy but looking carefully into his face she turned pale
yes said $mr_raskolnikov$ smiling i have come for your cross $sonia$ it was you told me to go to the cross roads why is it you are frightened
his tone seemed strange to her a cold shiver ran over her but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the words were a mask
now it come to that $sonia$ gazed at him astonished he spoke to her looking away as though to avoid meeting her eyes
you see $sonia$ i ve decided that it will be better so there is one fact but it a long #story# and there no need to discuss it
it annoys me that all those stupid brutish faces will be gaping at me directly pestering me with their stupid questions which i shall have to answer they ll #point# their fingers at me
but do you know what angers me tfoo you know i am not going to $porfiry_petrovitch$ i am sick of him
i rather go to my #friend# the explosive lieutenant how i shall surprise him what a sensation i shall make but i must be cooler i ve become too irritable of late
you know i was nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now because she turned to take a last look at me
it a brutal state to be in ah what am i coming to well where are the crosses he seemed hardly to know what he was doing
he could not stay still or concentrate his attention on anything his ideas seemed to gallop after one another he talked incoherently his #hand# trembled slightly
without a word $sonia$ took out of the drawer two crosses one of cypress wood and one of copper she made the sign of the cross over herself and over him and put the wooden cross on his neck
it the symbol of my taking up the cross he laughed as though i had not suffered much till now
the wooden cross that is the peasant one the copper one that is $lizaveta_ivanovna$ you will wear yourself show me so she had it on at that moment
i remember two things like these too a silver one and a little ikon i threw them back on the old woman neck
those would be appropriate now really those are what i ought to put on now but i am talking nonsense and forgetting what matters i somehow forgetful
you see i have come to warn you $sonia$ so that you might know that all that all i came for
but i #thought# i had more to say you wanted me to go yourself well now i am going to prison and you ll have your wish
well what are you crying for you too dont leave off oh how i hate it all but his feeling was stirred his heart ached as he looked at her
why is she grieving too he #thought# to himself what am i to her why does she weep
why is she looking after me like my #mother# or $dounia$ she ll be my nurse cross yourself say at least one prayer $sonia$ begged in a timid broken voice
oh certainly as much as you like and sincerely $sonia$ sincerely but he wanted to say #something# quite different
he crossed himself several times $sonia$ took up her shawl and put it over her #head# it was the green drap de dames shawl of which $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ had spoken the family shawl
$mr_raskolnikov$ #thought# of that looking at it but he did not ask he began to feel himself that he was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated
he was frightened at this he was suddenly struck too by the #thought# that $sonia$ meant to go with him
what are you doing where are you going stay here stay i ll go alone he cried in cowardly vexation and almost resentful he moved towards the #door#
what the use of going in procession he muttered going out $sonia$ remained standing in the middle of the room
he had not even said good bye to her he had forgotten her a poignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart
was it right was it right all this he #thought# again as he went down the stairs couldnt he stop and retract it all and not go
as he turned into the #street# he remembered that he had not said good bye to $sonia$ that he had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl not daring to stir after he had shouted at her and he stopped short for a moment
at the same instant another #thought# dawned upon him as though it had been lying in wait to strike him then
but still he went he felt suddenly once for all that he mustnt ask himself questions why with what object did i go to her just now
i told her on business on what business i had no sort of business to tell her i was going but where was the need
do i love her no no i drove her away just now like a dog did i want her crosses oh how low i ve sunk
no i wanted her tears i wanted to see her terror to see how her heart ached i had to have #something# to cling to #something# to delay me some friendly face to see
and i dared to believe in myself to dream of what i would do i am a beggarly contemptible wretch contemptible
he walked along the canal bank and he had not much further to go but on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it went to the hay market
he looked eagerly to right and left gazed intently at every object and could not fix his attention on anything everything slipped away
in another week another month i shall be driven in a prison van over this bridge how shall i look at the canal then
i should like to remember this slipped into his mind look at this sign how shall i read those letters then
it written here campany that a thing to remember that letter a and to look at it again in a month how shall i look at it then
what shall i be feeling and thinking then how trivial it all must be what i am fretting about now of course it must all be interesting in its way
ha ha ha what am i thinking about i am becoming a baby i am showing off to myself why am i ashamed
foo how people shove that fat #man# a german he must be who pushed against me does he know whom he pushed there a peasant woman with a baby begging
it curious that she thinks me happier than she is i might give her #something# for the incongruity of it here a five copeck piece left in my #pocket# where did i get it
here here take it my good woman god bless you the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice he went into the hay market
he would have given anything in the world to be alone but he knew himself that he would not have remained alone for a moment
it was distasteful very distasteful to be in a crowd but he walked just where he saw most people there was a #man# drunk and disorderly in the crowd he kept trying to dance and falling down
$mr_raskolnikov$ squeezed his way through the crowd stared for some minutes at the drunken #man# and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh
there was a ring round him a minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him though he still stared
he moved away at last not remembering where he was but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly came over him overwhelming him body and mind
he suddenly recalled $sonia$ words go to the cross roads bow down to the people kiss the earth for you have sinned against it too and say aloud to the whole world i am a murderer
and the hopeless #misery# and anxiety of all that time especially of the last hours had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed complete sensation
it came over him like a #fit# it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and spreading fire through him
he trembled remembering that everything in him softened at once and the tears started into his eyes he fell to the earth on the spot
he knelt down in the middle of the square bowed down to the earth and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture
he got up and bowed down a second time he boozed a youth near him observed there was a roar of laughter
he bowing down to all the world and kissing the great city of st petersburg and its pavement added a workman who was a little drunk
he going to jerusalem brothers and saying good bye to his #child# and his country quite a young #man# too observed a third
and a gentleman someone observed soberly there no knowing who a gentleman and who isnt nowadays these exclamations and remarks checked $mr_raskolnikov$ and the words
i am a murderer which were perhaps on the #point# of dropping from his lips died away he bore these remarks quietly however and without looking round he turned down a #street# leading to the police office
he had a glimpse of #something# on the way which did not surprise him he had felt that it must be so
the second time he bowed down in the hay market he saw standing fifty paces from him on the left $sonia$
she was hiding from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market place she had followed him then on his painful way
$mr_raskolnikov$ at that moment felt and knew once for all that $sonia$ was with him for ever and would follow him to the #end# of the earth wherever fate might take him
it wrung his heart but he was just reaching the fatal place he went into the yard fairly resolutely he had to mount to the third storey
he felt as though the fateful moment was still far off as though he had plenty of time left for consideration
again the same rubbish the same eggshells lying about on the spiral stairs again the open #door# of the flats again the same kitchens and the same fumes and stench coming from them
i shall be some time going up he #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$ had not been here since that #day# his legs were numb and gave way under him but still they moved forward
he stopped for a moment to take breath to collect himself so as to enter like a #man# but why what for
he wondered reflecting if i must drink the cup what difference does it make the more revolting the better
he imagined for an instant the figure of the explosive lieutenant $ilya_petrovitch$ was he actually going to him couldnt he go to someone else
to $nikodim_fomitch$ couldnt he turn back and go straight to $nikodim_fomitch$ lodgings at least then it would be done privately
no no to the explosive lieutenant if he must drink it drink it off at once turning cold and hardly conscious he opened the #door# of the office
there were very few people in it this time only a house porter and a peasant the doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen
$mr_raskolnikov$ walked into the next room perhaps i still need not speak passed through his mind some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was settling himself at a bureau to write
in a #corner# another clerk was seating himself $mr_zametov$ was not there nor of course $nikodim_fomitch$ no one in
not a sound was heard not a sight was seen but i scent the russian how does it go on in the fairy tale
$mr_raskolnikov$ asked addressing the person at the bureau whom do you want a ah i ve forgotten at your service a familiar voice cried suddenly
$mr_raskolnikov$ shuddered the explosive lieutenant stood before him he had just come in from the third room it is the #hand# of fate #thought# $mr_raskolnikov$
why is he here you ve come to see us what about cried $ilya_petrovitch$ he was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle exhilarated
if it on business you are rather early it only a chance that i am here however i ll do what i can
dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after sunset and that the last time $mr_raskolnikov$ visited the police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for coming too late translator
i must admit i what is it what is it excuse me $mr_raskolnikov$ of course $mr_raskolnikov$ you didnt imagine i forgotten
dont think i am like that $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ ro ro rodionovitch that it isnt it $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ yes yes of course $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$
i was just getting at it i made many inquiries about you i assure you i ve been genuinely grieved since that since i behaved like that
it was explained to me afterwards that you were a literary #man# and a learned one too and so to say the first #step#
mercy on us what literary or scientific #man# does not begin by some originality of conduct my wife and i have the greatest respect for literature in my wife
it a genuine passion literature and art if only a #man# is a gentleman all the rest can be gained by talents learning good sense genius
i can buy a hat as easily as i can a bun but what under the hat what the hat covers i cant buy that
as for a hat well what does a hat matter i was even meaning to come and apologise to you but #thought# maybe you
but i am forgetting to ask you is there anything you want really i hear your family have come yes my #mother# and sister
i ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister a highly cultivated and charming person i confess i was sorry
i got so hot with you there it is but as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting #fit# that affair has been cleared up splendidly
bigotry and fanaticism i understand your indignation perhaps you are changing your lodging on account of your family arriving no i only looked in
i came to ask i #thought# that i should find $mr_zametov$ here oh yes of course you ve made #friend# i heard
well no $mr_zametov$ is not here yes we ve lost $mr_zametov$ he not been here since yesterday he quarrelled with everyone on leaving in the rudest way
he is a feather headed youngster that all one might have expected #something# from him but there you know what they are our brilliant young #man#
he wanted to go in for some examination but it only to talk and boast about it it will go no further than that
of course it a very different matter with you or $mr_razumihin$ there your #friend# your career is an intellectual one and you wont be deterred by failure
for you one may say all the attractions of life nihil est you are an ascetic a monk a hermit a book a pen behind your ear a learned research that where your spirit soars
i am the same way myself have you read livingstone travels no oh i have there are a great many nihilists about nowadays you know and indeed it is not to be wondered at
what sort of #day# are they i ask you but we #thought# you are not a nihilist of course answer me openly openly
no believe me you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself official duty is one thing
it not friendship but the feeling of a #man# and a citizen the feeling of humanity and of love for the almighty
but you are thinking i meant to say friendship is quite another no you re wrong i may be an official but i am always bound to feel myself a #man# and a citizen
$mr_zametov$ will make a scandal in the french style in a house of bad reputation over a glass of champagne that all your $mr_zametov$ is good for
you were asking about $mr_zametov$ while i perhaps so to speak burning with devotion and lofty feelings and besides i have rank consequence a post
i am married and have #child# i fulfil the duties of a #man# and a citizen but who is he may i ask
i appeal to you as a #man# ennobled by education then these midwives too have become extraordinarily numerous $mr_raskolnikov$ raised his eyebrows inquiringly
the words of $ilya_petrovitch$ who had obviously been dining were for the most part a stream of empty sounds for him
but some of them he understood he looked at him inquiringly not knowing how it would #end# i mean those crop headed wenches the talkative $ilya_petrovitch$ continued
midwives is my name for them i think it a very satisfactory one ha ha they go to the academy study anatomy
if i fall ill am i to send for a young lady to treat me what do you say ha ha
$ilya_petrovitch$ laughed quite pleased with his own wit it an immoderate zeal for education but once you re educated that enough
why abuse it why insult honourable people as that scoundrel $mr_zametov$ does why did he insult me i ask you look at these suicides too how common they are you cant fancy
people spend their last halfpenny and kill themselves boys and girls and old people only this morning we heard about a gentleman who had just come to town
nil pavlitch i say what was the name of that gentleman who shot himself $mr_svidrigaïlov$ someone answered from the other room with drowsy listlessness
$mr_raskolnikov$ started $mr_svidrigaïlov$ svidrigaïlov has shot himself he cried what do you know $mr_svidrigaïlov$ yes i knew him
he had lost his wife was a #man# of reckless habits and all of a sudden shot himself and in such a shocking way
he hadnt been here long yes that so he left faculties and that no one is to blame for his death
he had money they say how did you come to know him i was acquainted my sister was governess in his family
bah bah bah then no doubt you can tell us #something# about him you had no suspicion i saw him yesterday he was drinking wine i knew nothing
$mr_raskolnikov$ felt as though #something# had fallen on him and was stifling him you ve turned pale again it so stuffy here
yes i must go muttered $mr_raskolnikov$ excuse my troubling you oh not at all as often as you like
it a pleasure to see you and i am glad to say so $ilya_petrovitch$ held out his #hand#
i only wanted i came to see $mr_zametov$ i understand i understand and it a pleasure to see you i am very glad
good bye $mr_raskolnikov$ smiled he went out he reeled he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know what he was doing
he fancied that a porter pushed past him on his way upstairs to the police office that a dog in the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a rolling pin at it and shouted
he began going down the stairs supporting himself with his right #hand# against the #wall# he went down and out into the yard
there not far from the entrance stood $sonia$ pale and horror stricken she looked wildly at him he stood still before her
there was a look of poignant #agony# of despair in her face she clasped her #hand# his lips worked in an ugly meaningless smile
he stood still a minute grinned and went back to the police office $ilya_petrovitch$ had sat down and was rummaging among some papers
before him stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs hulloa back again have you left #something# behind
he walked right to the table leaned his #hand# on it tried to say #something# but could not only incoherent sounds were audible
what the matter $mr_raskolnikov$ with white lips and staring eyes came slowly nearer you are feeling ill a chair
$mr_raskolnikov$ dropped on to a chair but he kept his eyes fixed on the face of $ilya_petrovitch$ which expressed unpleasant surprise
here sit down some water both looked at one another for a minute and waited water was brought it was i began $mr_raskolnikov$
$mr_raskolnikov$ refused the water with his #hand# and softly and brokenly but distinctly said it was i killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister $lizaveta_ivanovna$ with an axe and robbed them
drink some water $ilya_petrovitch$ opened his mouth people ran up on all sides $mr_raskolnikov$ repeated his statement epilogue i siberia
on the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town one of the administrative centres of russia in the town there is a fortress in the fortress there is a prison
in the prison the second class convict $rodion_romanovitch_raskolnikov$ $mr_raskolnikov$ has been confined for nine months almost a year and a half has passed since his crime
there had been little difficulty about his trial the criminal adhered exactly firmly and clearly to his statement he did not confuse nor misrepresent the facts nor soften them in his own interest nor omit the smallest detail
he explained every incident of the murder the secret of the pledge the piece of wood with a strip of metal which was found in the murdered woman #hand#
he described minutely how he had taken her keys what they were like as well as the chest and its contents he explained the mystery of $lizaveta_ivanovna$ murder described how $koch$ and after him the student knocked and repeated all they had said to one another how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard $nikolay$ and $dmitri_prokofitch$ shouting how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards gone home
he ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the voznesensky prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found
the lawyers and the judges were very much struck among other things by the fact that he had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone without making use of them and that what was more he did not now remember what the trinkets were like or even how many there were
the fact that he had never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed incredible
the whole thing in fact was perfectly clear there turned out to be in the purse three hundred and seventeen #rouble# and sixty copecks
they were a long while trying to discover why the accused #man# should tell a lie about this when about everything else he had made a truthful and straightforward confession
finally some of the lawyers more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really not looked into the purse and so didnt know what was in it when he hid it under the stone
but they immediately drew the deduction that the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental derangement through homicidal mania without object or the pursuit of gain
this fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary insanity so often applied in our #day# in criminal cases
moreover $mr_raskolnikov$ hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses by dr $zossimov$ his former fellow students his landlady and her servant
all this pointed strongly to the conclusion that $mr_raskolnikov$ was not quite like an ordinary murderer and robber but that there was another element in the case
from being so long under the stone some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the damp to the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself
to the decisive question as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery he answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was his miserable position his #poverty# and helplessness and his #desire# to provide for his first #step# in life by the help of the three thousand #rouble# he had reckoned on finding
he had been led to the murder through his shallow and cowardly nature exasperated moreover by privation and failure to the question what led him to confess he answered that it was his heartfelt repentance
the #sentence# however was more merciful than could have been expected perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself but had rather shown a #desire# to exaggerate his guilt
all this was almost coarse all the strange and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration there could be no doubt of the abnormal and #poverty# stricken condition of the criminal at the time
the fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse partly to his abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime
incidentally the murder of $lizaveta_ivanovna$ served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis a #man# commits two murders and forgets that the #door# is open
finally the confession at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by $nikolay$ through melancholy and fanaticism and when moreover there were no proofs against the real criminal no suspicions even $porfiry_petrovitch$ fully kept his word all this did much to soften the #sentence#
$mr_razumihin$ somehow discovered and proved that while $mr_raskolnikov$ was at the university he had helped a poor consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting him for six months and when this student died leaving a decrepit old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year $mr_raskolnikov$ had got the old #man# into a hospital and paid for his funeral when he died
$mr_raskolnikov$ landlady bore witness too that when they had lived in another house at five #corner# $mr_raskolnikov$ had rescued two little #child# from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so
other circumstances too in the prisoner favour came out quite unexpectedly this was investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses
and in the #end# the criminal was in consideration of extenuating circumstances condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a term of eight years only
these facts made an impression in his favour at the very beginning of the trial $mr_raskolnikov$ #mother# fell ill $dounia$ and $mr_razumihin$ found it possible to get her out of petersburg during the trial
$mr_razumihin$ chose a town on the railway not far from petersburg so as to be able to follow every #step# of the trial and at the same time to see $avdotya_romanovna$ as often as possible
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial derangement of her intellect when $dounia$ returned from her last interview with her brother she had found her #mother# already ill in feverish delirium
$mr_razumihin$ and she agreed what answers they must make to her #mother# questions about $mr_raskolnikov$ and made up a complete #story# for her #mother# benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of russia on a business commission which would bring him in the #end# money and reputation
but they were struck by the fact that $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ never asked them anything on the subject neither then nor thereafter
on the contrary she had her own version of her son sudden departure she told them with tears how he had come to say good bye to her hinting that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts and that $rodya$ had many very powerful enemies so that it was necessary for him to be in hiding
as for his future career she had no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed
she assured $mr_razumihin$ that her son would be one #day# a great statesman that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it
this article she was continually reading she even read it aloud almost took it to bed with her but scarcely asked where $rodya$ was though the subject was obviously avoided by the others which might have been enough to awaken her suspicions
she did not for instance complain of getting no letters from him though in previous years she had only lived on the #hope# of letters from her beloved $rodya$
this was the cause of great uneasiness to $dounia$ the idea occurred to her that her #mother# suspected that there was #something# terrible in her son fate and was afraid to ask for fear of hearing #something# still more awful
that #evening# they began to be frightened at last at $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ strange silence on certain subjects in any case $dounia$ saw clearly that her #mother# was not in full possession of her faculties
it happened once or twice however that $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ gave such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her without mentioning where $rodya$ was and on receiving unsatisfactory and suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent and this mood lasted for a long time
$dounia$ saw at last that it was hard to deceive her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely silent on certain #point# but it became more and more evident that the poor #mother# suspected #something# terrible
$dounia$ remembered her brother telling her that her #mother# had overheard her talking in her sleep on the night after her interview with $mr_svidrigaïlov$ and before the fatal #day# of the confession had not she made out #something# from that
sometimes #day# and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be succeeded by a period of hysterical animation and the invalid would begin to talk almost incessantly of her son of her #hope# of his future
they humoured her pretended to agree with her she saw perhaps that they were pretending but she still went on talking
her fancies were sometimes very strange five months after $mr_raskolnikov$ confession he was sentenced $mr_razumihin$ and $sonia$ saw him in prison as often as it was possible
at last the moment of separation came $dounia$ swore to her brother that the separation should not be for ever $mr_razumihin$ did the same
$mr_razumihin$ in his youthful ardour had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years and saving up a certain sum to emigrate to siberia a country rich in every natural resource and in need of workers active #man# and capital
there they would settle in the town where $rodya$ was and all together would begin a new life they all wept at parting
$mr_raskolnikov$ had been very dreamy for a few #day# before he asked a great deal about his #mother# and was constantly anxious about her
he worried so much about her that it alarmed $dounia$ when he heard about his #mother# illness he became very gloomy
with the help of the money left to her by $mr_svidrigaïlov$ $sonia$ had long ago made her preparations to follow the party of convicts in which he was despatched to siberia
with $sonia$ he was particularly reserved all the time not a word passed between $mr_raskolnikov$ and her on the subject but both knew it would be so
at the final leave taking he smiled strangely at his sister and $mr_razumihin$ fervent anticipations of their happy future together when he should come out of prison
he predicted that their #mother# illness would soon have a fatal ending $sonia$ and he at last set off two months later $dounia$ was married to $mr_razumihin$
it was a quiet and sorrowful wedding $porfiry_petrovitch$ and $zossimov$ were invited however during all this period $mr_razumihin$ wore an air of resolute determination
$dounia$ put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she could not but believe in him he displayed a rare strength of will
among other things he began attending university lectures again in order to take his degree they were continually making plans for the future both counted on settling in siberia within five years at least
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was delighted to give her blessing to $dounia$ marriage with $mr_razumihin$ but after the marriage she became even more melancholy and anxious
to give her pleasure $mr_razumihin$ told her how $mr_raskolnikov$ had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two little #child# from a fire
till then they rested their #hope# on $sonia$ these two pieces of news excited $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ disordered imagination almost to ecstasy
in public conveyances and shops wherever she could capture a listener she would begin the discourse about her son his article how he had helped the student how he had been burnt at the fire and so on
she was continually talking about them even entering into conversation with strangers in the #street# though $dounia$ always accompanied her $dounia$ did not know how to restrain her
apart from the danger of her morbid excitement there was the risk of someone recalling $mr_raskolnikov$ name and speaking of the recent trial
$pulcheria_alexandrovna$ found out the address of the #mother# of the two #child# her son had saved and insisted on going to see her
at last her restlessness reached an extreme #point# she would sometimes begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious
one morning she declared that by her reckoning $rodya$ ought soon to be home that she remembered when he said good bye to her
she began to prepare for his coming began to do up her room for him to clean the furniture to wash and put up new hangings and so on
he said that they must expect him back in nine months $dounia$ was anxious but said nothing and helped her to arrange the room
after a fatiguing #day# spent in continual fancies in joyful #day# dreams and tears $pulcheria_alexandrovna$ was taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious
in her delirium she dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her son terrible fate than they had supposed
for a long time $mr_raskolnikov$ did not know of his #mother# death though a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached siberia
it was carried on by means of $sonia$ who wrote every month to the razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity
at first they found $sonia$ letters dry and unsatisfactory but later on they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better for from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate brother life
$sonia$ letters were full of the most matter of fact detail the simplest and clearest description of all $mr_raskolnikov$ surroundings as a convict
it was brain fever she died within a fortnight there was no word of her own #hope# no conjecture as to the future no description of her feelings
instead of any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life she gave the simple facts that is his own words an exact account of his health what he asked for at their interviews what commission he gave her and so on
all these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness the picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness and precision
there could be no mistake because nothing was given but facts but $dounia$ and her husband could get little comfort out of the news especially at first
$sonia$ wrote that he was constantly sullen and not ready to talk that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave him from their letters that he sometimes asked after his #mother# and that when seeing that he had guessed the truth she told him at last of her death she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly affected by it not externally at any rate
she told them that although he seemed so wrapped up in himself and as it were shut himself off from everyone he took a very direct and simple view of his new life that he understood his position expected nothing better for the time had no ill founded #hope# as is so common in his position and scarcely seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings so unlike anything he had known before
she wrote that his health was satisfactory he did his work without shirking or seeking to do more he was almost indifferent about food but except on sundays and holidays the food was so bad that at last he had been glad to accept some money from her $sonia$ to have his own tea every #day#
$sonia$ wrote further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest that she had not seen the inside of their barracks but concluded that they were crowded miserable and unhealthy that he slept on a plank bed with a rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement
he begged her not to trouble about anything else declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him but that he lived so poorly and roughly not from any plan or design but simply from inattention and indifference
$sonia$ wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming unwilling to talk and rude to her
but that in the #end# these visits had become a habit and almost a necessity for him so that he was positively distressed when she was ill for some #day# and could not visit him
she used to see him on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard room to which he was brought for a few minutes to see her
on working #day# she would go to see him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns or at the sheds on the banks of the irtish
about herself $sonia$ wrote that she had succeeded in making some acquaintances in the town that she did sewing and as there was scarcely a dressmaker in the town she was looked upon as an indispensable person in many houses
but she did not mention that the authorities were through her interested in $mr_raskolnikov$ that his task was lightened and so on
at last the news came $dounia$ had indeed noticed signs of alarm and uneasiness in the preceding letters that he held aloof from everyone that his fellow prisoners did not like him that he kept silent for #day# at a time and was becoming very pale
in the last letter $sonia$ wrote that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of the hospital
but it was not the horrors of prison life not the hard labour the bad food the shaven #head# or the patched clothes that crushed him
ii he was ill a long time what did he care for all those trials and hardships he was even glad of the hard work
physically exhausted he could at least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep and what was the food to him the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it
in the past as a student he had often not had even that his clothes were warm and suited to his manner of life
he did not even feel the fetters was he ashamed of his shaven #head# and parti coloured coat before whom before $sonia$
$sonia$ was afraid of him how could he be ashamed before her and yet he was ashamed even before $sonia$ whom he tortured because of it with his contemptuous rough manner
but it was not his shaven #head# and his fetters he was ashamed of his pride had been stung to the quick
it was wounded pride that made him ill oh how happy he would have been if he could have blamed himself
but he judged himself severely and his exasperated conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past except a simple blunder which might happen to #anyone#
he was ashamed just because he $mr_raskolnikov$ had so hopelessly stupidly come to grief through some decree of blind fate and must humble himself and submit to the idiocy of a #sentence# if he were anyhow to be at peace
he could have borne anything then even shame and disgrace vague and objectless anxiety in the present and in the future a continual sacrifice leading to nothing
and what comfort was it to him that at the #end# of eight years he would only be thirty two and able to begin a new life
that was all that lay before him what had he to live for what had he to look forward to why should he strive
why he had been ready a thousand times before to give up existence for the sake of an idea for a #hope# even for a fancy
perhaps it was just because of the strength of his #desire# that he had #thought# himself a #man# to whom more was permissible than to others
and if only fate would have sent him repentance burning repentance that would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep that repentance the awful #agony# of which brings visions of hanging or drowning
to live in order to exist mere existence had always been too little for him he had always wanted more oh he would have been glad of it
at least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity as he had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison
but now in prison in freedom he #thought# over and criticised all his actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque as they had seemed at the fatal time
in what way he asked himself was my theory stupider than others that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world
one has only to look at the thing quite independently broadly and uninfluenced by commonplace ideas and my idea will by no means seem so strange
tears and #agony# would at least have been life but he did not repent of his crime oh sceptics and halfpenny philosophers why do you halt half way
why does my action strike them as so horrible he said to himself is it because it was a crime
what is meant by crime my conscience is at rest of course it was a legal crime of course the letter of the law was broken and blood was shed
of course in that case many of the benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first #step#
well punish me for the letter of the law and that enough but those #man# succeeded and so they were right and i didnt
it was only in that that he recognised his criminality only in the fact that he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it
and so i had no right to have taken that #step# he suffered too from the question why had he not killed himself
why had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess was the #desire# to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it
in #misery# he asked himself this question and could not understand that at the very time he had been standing looking into the river he had perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and his convictions
he didnt understand that that consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis of a new view of life and of his future resurrection
he preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he could not #step# over again through weakness and meanness
had not $mr_svidrigaïlov$ overcome it although he was afraid of death he looked at his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and prized it
it seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in prison than in freedom what terrible #agony# and privations some of them the tramps for instance had endured
could they care so much for a ray of sunshine for the primeval forest the cold spring hidden away in some unseen spot which the tramp had marked three years before and longed to see again as he might to see his sweetheart dreaming of the green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush
in prison of course there was a great deal he did not see and did not want to see he lived as it were with downcast eyes
but in the #end# there was much that surprised him and he began as it were involuntarily to notice much that he had not suspected before
as he went on he saw still more inexplicable examples it was loathsome and unbearable for him to look what surprised him most of all was the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest
he felt and knew the reasons of his isolation but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons were so deep and strong
they seemed to be a different species and he looked at them and they at him with distrust and hostility there were some polish exiles political prisoners among them
they simply looked down upon all the rest as ignorant churls but $mr_raskolnikov$ could not look upon them like that he saw that these ignorant #man# were in many respects far wiser than the poles
there were some russians who were just as contemptuous a former officer and two seminarists $mr_raskolnikov$ saw their mistake as clearly
he was disliked and avoided by everyone they even began to hate him at last why he could not tell #man# who had been far more guilty despised and laughed at his crime
you re a gentleman they used to say you shouldnt hack about with an axe that not a gentleman work
the second week in lent his turn came to take the sacrament with his gang he went to church and prayed with the others
a quarrel broke out one #day# he did not know how all fell on him at once in a fury
you re an infidel you dont believe in god they shouted you ought to be killed he had never talked to them about god nor his belief but they wanted to kill him as an infidel
he said nothing one of the prisoners rushed at him in a perfect frenzy $mr_raskolnikov$ awaited him calmly and silently his eyebrows did not quiver his face did not flinch
the guard succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant or there would have been bloodshed there was another question he could not decide why were they all so fond of $sonia$
she did not try to win their favour she rarely met them sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment
and yet everybody knew her they knew that she had come out to follow him knew how and where she lived
she never gave them money did them no particular services only once at christmas she sent them all presents of pies and rolls
but by degrees closer relations sprang up between them and $sonia$ she would write and post letters for them to their relations
relations of the prisoners who visited the town at their instructions left with $sonia$ presents and money for them their wives and sweethearts knew her and used to visit her
and when she visited $mr_raskolnikov$ at work or met a party of the prisoners on the road they all took off their hats to her
little #mother# $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ you are our dear good little #mother# coarse branded criminals said to that frail little creature
they even admired her gait and turned round to watch her walking they admired her too for being so little and in fact did not know what to admire her most for
she would smile and bow to them and everyone was delighted when she smiled they even came to her for help in their illnesses
he was in the hospital from the middle of lent till after easter when he was better he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish and delirious
he dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strange plague that had come to europe from the depths of asia
all were to be destroyed except a very few chosen some new sorts of microbes were attacking the bodies of #man# but these microbes were endowed with intelligence and will
#man# attacked by them became at once mad and furious but never had #man# considered themselves so intellectual and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers
never had they considered their decisions their scientific conclusions their moral convictions so infallible whole villages whole towns and peoples went mad from the infection
each #thought# that he alone had the truth and was wretched looking at the others beat himself on the breast wept and wrung his #hand#
they did not know how to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what good they did not know whom to blame whom to justify
they gathered together in armies against one another but even on the march the armies would begin attacking each other the ranks would be broken and the soldiers would fall on each other stabbing and cutting biting and devouring each other
the alarm bell was ringing all #day# long in the towns #man# rushed together but why they were summoned and who was summoning them no one knew
all were excited and did not understand one another #man# killed each other in a sort of senseless #spite# the most ordinary trades were abandoned because everyone proposed his own ideas his own improvements and they could not agree
#man# met in groups agreed on #something# swore to keep together but at once began on #something# quite different from what they had proposed
the land too was abandoned they accused one another fought and killed each other there were conflagrations and famine all #man# and all things were involved in destruction
they were a pure chosen people destined to found a new race and a new life to renew and purify the earth but no one had seen these #man# no one had heard their words and their voices
$mr_raskolnikov$ was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so miserably the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long
the plague spread and moved further and further only a few #man# could be saved in the whole world the second week after easter had come
$sonia$ had only been able to visit him twice during his illness each time she had to obtain permission and it was difficult
but she often used to come to the hospital yard especially in the #evening# sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the windows of the ward
there were warm bright spring #day# in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel paced were opened one #evening# when he was almost well again $mr_raskolnikov$ fell asleep
on waking up he chanced to go to the window and at once saw $sonia$ in the distance at the hospital gate
she seemed to be waiting for someone #something# stabbed him to the heart at that minute he shuddered and moved away from the window
next #day# $sonia$ did not come nor the #day# after he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily at last he was discharged
on reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that $sofya_semyonovna_marmeladov$ was lying ill at home and was unable to go out
hearing that he was anxious about her $sonia$ sent him a pencilled note telling him that she was much better that she had a slight cold and that she would soon very soon come and see him at his work
he was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her he soon learnt that her illness was not dangerous his heart throbbed painfully as he read it
early in the morning at six clock he went off to work on the river bank where they used to pound alabaster and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed
one of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to fetch a tool the other began getting the wood ready and laying it in the kiln
$mr_raskolnikov$ came out of the shed on to the river bank sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the wide deserted river
from the high bank a broad landscape opened before him the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank
again it was a warm bright #day# there were only three of them sent in the vast steppe bathed in sunshine he could just see like black specks the nomads tents
there there was freedom there other #man# were living utterly unlike those here there time itself seemed to stand still as though the age of abraham and his flocks had not passed
$mr_raskolnikov$ sat gazing his #thought# passed into #day# dreams into contemplation he #thought# of nothing but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him
suddenly he found $sonia$ beside him she had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side it was still quite early the morning chill was still keen
she wore her poor old burnous and the green shawl her face still showed signs of illness it was thinner and paler
she was always timid of holding out her #hand# to him and sometimes did not offer it at all as though afraid he would repel it
he always took her #hand# as though with repugnance always seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her visit
she gave him a joyful smile of welcome but held out her #hand# with her usual timidity sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply grieved
but now their #hand# did not part he stole a rapid glance at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking
they were alone no one had seen them the guard had turned away for the time how it happened he did not know
but all at once #something# seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet he wept and threw his arms round her knees
for the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale she jumped up and looked at him trembling but at the same moment she understood and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes
she knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come they wanted to speak but could not tears stood in their eyes
they were both pale and thin but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future of a full resurrection into a new life
they were renewed by love the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other they resolved to wait and be patient
but he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his being while she she only lived in his life
on the #evening# of the same #day# when the barracks were locked $mr_raskolnikov$ lay on his plank bed and #thought# of her
he had even fancied that #day# that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him differently he had even entered into talk with them and they answered him in a friendly way
they had another seven years to wait and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them he remembered that now and #thought# it was bound to be so
wasnt everything now bound to be changed he #thought# of her he remembered how continually he had tormented her and wounded her heart
he remembered her pale and thin little face but these recollections scarcely troubled him now he knew with what infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings
everything even his crime his #sentence# and imprisonment seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an external strange fact with which he had no concern
but he could not think for long together of anything that #evening# and he could not have analysed anything consciously he was simply feeling
and what were all all the #agony# of the past life had stepped into the place of theory and #something# quite different would work itself out in his mind
under his pillow lay the new testament he took it up mechanically the book belonged to $sonia$ it was the one from which she had read the raising of lazarus to him
at first he was afraid that she would worry him about religion would talk about the gospel and pester him with books
he had asked her for it himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without a word
but to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject and had not even offered him the testament till now he had not opened it
he did not open it now but one #thought# passed through his mind can her convictions not be mine now her feelings her aspirations at least
she too had been greatly agitated that #day# and at night she was taken ill again but she was so happy and so unexpectedly happy that she was almost frightened of her happiness
at the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready to look on those seven years as though they were seven #day#
he did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing that he would have to pay dearly for it that it would cost him great striving great suffering
but that is the beginning of a new #story# the #story# of the gradual renewal of a #man# the #story# of his gradual regeneration of his passing from one world into another of his initiation into a new unknown life
