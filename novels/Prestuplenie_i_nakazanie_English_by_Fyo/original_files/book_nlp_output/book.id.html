<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) parents were very hard-working and deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five children in only two rooms.
<p/>Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor. The father and mother spent their evenings in reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious character.
<p/>Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the final examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) had already begun his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) first work, <div class="bookquote">``Poor Folk.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) review and was received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself instantly something of a celebrity.
<p/>A brilliant and successful career seemed to open before him (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>), but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) was arrested.
<p/>Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky was one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier and Proudhon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) was accused of <div class="bookquote">``taking part in conversations against the censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of knowing of the intention to set up a printing press.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Under Nicholas I. -LRB-that <div class="bookquote">``stern and just man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nicholas I.</b></font>)</div>as Maurice Baring calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>)-RRB- this was enough, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) was condemned to death.
<p/>Writing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: <div class="bookquote">``They snapped words over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by persons condemned to death.
<p/>After eight months' imprisonment he (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to be shot. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes, to suffer execution.
<p/>I thought of you and your dear ones and I contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to bid them farewell.
<p/>Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound, brought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) Majesty had spared us our lives.
<p/>Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only a few minutes of life before me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>)</div>The sentence was commuted to hard labour.
<p/>One of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) was untied, and never regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) sanity. The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on Dostoevsky's mind.
<p/>Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) religious temper led him (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) in the end to accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) own case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) constantly recurs to the subject in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) writings.
<p/>Then followed four years of penal servitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) began the <div class="bookquote">``Dead House,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and some years of service in a disciplinary battalion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) arrest and this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) suffered for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the cruelty of inflicting such torture. The fits occurred three or four times a year and were more frequent in periods of great strain.
<p/>In 1859 he (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) was allowed to return to Russia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) started a journal--<div class="bookquote">``Vremya,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>which was forbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding.
<p/>In 1864 he (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) first wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) brother Mihail. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) was in terrible poverty, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) took upon himself the payment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) brother's debts.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) was weighed down by debt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) brother's family was dependent on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is said never to have corrected his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) work.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) started another journal--<div class="bookquote">``The Epoch,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>which within a few months was also prohibited. The later years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) life were much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) second wife.
<p/>In June 1880 he (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) famous speech at the unveiling of the monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) was received with extraordinary demonstrations of love and honour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) was followed to the grave by a vast multitude of mourners, who ``gave the hapless man the funeral of a king.
<p/>In the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling inspired by Dostoevsky: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and our bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than we have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart which we seek that we may learn from it how to live.
<p/>A few months later Dostoevsky died. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) other gifts came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) from nature, this he (<font color='blue'><b>Dostoevsky</b></font>) won for himself and
<p/>On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K. bridge.
<p/>through it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became great. '' CRIME AND PUNISHMENT PART I CHAPTER I He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had successfully avoided meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) landlady on the staircase.
<p/>The landlady who provided him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with garret, dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went out he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was obliged to pass her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) kitchen, the door of which invariably stood open.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room. And each time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scowl and feel ashamed.
<p/>This was not because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but for some time past he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had become so completely absorbed in himself, and isolated from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellows that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dreaded meeting, not only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) landlady, but anyone at all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was hopelessly in debt to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) landlady, and was afraid of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position had of late ceased to weigh upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given up attending to matters of practical importance; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lost all desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and complaints, and to rack his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to lie--no, rather than that, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.
<p/>This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became acutely aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fears. '' I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought, with an odd smile.
<p/>'' Hm... yes, all is in a man's hands and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lets it all slip from cowardice , that's an axiom.
<p/>It would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most....
<p/>But I am talking too much. It's because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing.
<p/>I've learned to chatter this last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now?
<p/>Am I capable of that ? Is that serious? It is not serious at all. It's simply a fantasy to amuse myself;
<p/>The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man's already overwrought nerves.
<p/>The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met continually, although it was a working day, completed the revolting misery of the picture.
<p/>a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything. '' An expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man's refined face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair.
<p/>Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sank into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked along not observing what was about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and not caring to observe it.
<p/>From time to time, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would mutter something, from the habit of talking to himself, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had just confessed.
<p/>At these moments he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would become conscious that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very weak; for two days he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had scarcely tasted food.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags.
<p/>Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise.
<p/>But there was such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man's heart, that, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) minded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rags least of all in the street.
<p/>It was a different matter when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met with acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disliked meeting at any time.
<p/>And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse, suddenly shouted at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drove past: <div class="bookquote">``Hey there, German hatter''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>bawling at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice and pointing at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--the young man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat.
<p/>It was a tall round hat from Zimmerman's, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion.
<p/>In that quarter of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Zimmerman</b></font>).
<p/>'' I knew it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zimmerman</b></font>) muttered in confusion, <div class="bookquote">``I thought so! That's the worst of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan.
<p/>Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd and that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing.
<p/>Nobody wears such a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them a clue.
<p/>For this business one should be as little conspicuous as possible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it's just such trifles that always ruin everything...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) had not far to go; he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty.
<p/>At the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) had put no faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous but daring recklessness.
<p/>Now, a month later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) had begun to look upon them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) jeered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) own impotence and indecision, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) had involuntarily come to regard this <div class="bookquote">``hideous''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) still did not realise this himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) was positively going now for a <div class="bookquote">``rehearsal''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) project, and at every step his (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) excitement grew more and more violent.
<p/>With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) went up to a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the street.
<p/>This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by working people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc..
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) had counted them once when he (<font color='blue'><b>Nobody</b></font>) had been lost in dreams. There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the two courtyards of the house.
<p/>The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the staircase.
<p/>It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was familiar with it already, and knew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked all these surroundings: in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.
<p/>If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that I were really going to do it?
<p/>Three or four door-keepers were employed on the building. '' '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not help asking himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached the fourth storey.
<p/>There his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) progress was barred by some porters who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that the flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family.
<p/>This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman.
<p/>'' That's a good thing anyway,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rang the bell of the old woman's flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of copper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had forgotten the note of that bell, and now its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of something and to bring it clearly before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)....
<p/>The little flats in such houses always have bells that ring like that. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nerves were terribly overstrained by now.
<p/>In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old woman eyed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and nothing could be seen but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little eyes, glittering in the darkness.
<p/>But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grew bolder, and opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen.
<p/>The old woman stood facing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in silence and looking inquiringly at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a diminutive, withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp little nose.
<p/>Round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thin long neck, which looked like a hen's leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag, and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulders, a mangy fur cape, yellow with age.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared with oil, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore no kerchief over it. The old woman coughed and groaned at every instant.
<p/>The young man must have looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with a rather peculiar expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes again.
<p/>Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,'' the young man made haste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be more polite.
<p/>I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,'' the old woman said distinctly, still keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) inquiring eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
<p/>And here... I am again on the same errand,'' Raskolnikov continued, a little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman's mistrust.
<p/>Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought with an uneasy feeling.
<p/>The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side, and pointing to the door of the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, letting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) visitor pass in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Step in, my good sir.
<p/>The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly lighted up at that moment by the setting sun.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>flashed as it were by chance through Raskolnikov's mind, and with a rapid glance he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) scanned everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and remember its arrangement.
<p/>'' '' '' '' '' '' So the sun will shine like this then too! But there was nothing special in the room.
<p/>The furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was all.
<p/>In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished; everything shone.
<p/>'' Lizaveta's work,'' thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat.
<p/>It's in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such cleanliness,'' Raskolnikov thought again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stole a curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in which stood the old woman's bed and chest of drawers and into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had never looked before.
<p/>the old woman said severely, coming into the room and, as before, standing in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) so as to look him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) straight in the face.
<p/>I've brought something to pawn here,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) drew out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a globe; the chain was of steel.
<p/>'' These two rooms made up the whole flat. '' What do you want? '' '' '' But the time is up for your last pledge.
<p/>The month was up the day before yesterday.'' <div class="bookquote">``I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>But that's for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell your pledge at once.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A rouble and a half!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the young man.
<p/>The young man took it, and was so angry that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on the point of going away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere else he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could go, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had another object also in coming.
<p/>'' Please yourself''--and the old woman handed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back the watch. '' Hand it over,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said roughly. The old woman fumbled in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) keys, and disappeared behind the curtain into the other room.
<p/>The young man, left standing alone in the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) unlocking the chest of drawers.
<p/>'' It must be the top drawer,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reflected. '' So she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) carries the keys in a pocket on the right.
<p/>And there's one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches; that can't be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some other chest or strong-box...
<p/>All in one bunch on a steel ring.... that's worth knowing. Strong-boxes always have keys like that... but how degrading it all is.
<p/>Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance.
<p/>'' The old woman came back. '' But for the two roubles I lent you before , you owe me now twenty copecks on the same reckoning in advance.
<p/>That makes thirty-five copecks altogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. Here it is.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just so. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The young man did not dispute it and took the money.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at the old woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still something he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to say or to do, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not himself quite know what.
<p/>I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona Ivanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it back from a friend...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) broke off in confusion.
<p/>'' '' Well, we will talk about it then, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as casually as possible as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went out into the passage. '' What business is she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) of yours, my good sir?''
<p/>'' Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day, Alyona Ivanovna. '' Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went down the stairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) even stopped short, two or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought.
<p/>This confusion became more and more intense. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was in the street he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cried out, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, God, how loathsome it all is!
<p/>and can I, can I possibly.... No, it's nonsense, it's rubbish! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) added resolutely. '' And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?
<p/>What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I've been....
<p/>The feeling of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart while he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) way to the old woman, had by now reached such a pitch and had taken such a definite form that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not know what to do with himself to escape from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wretchedness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) walked along the pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling against them, and only came to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) senses when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was in the next street.
<p/>Looking round, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was standing close to a tavern which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.
<p/>At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and supporting one another, they mounted the steps.
<p/>'' But no words, no exclamations, could express his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) agitation. Without stopping to think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once.
<p/>Till that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had never been into a tavern, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt giddy and was tormented by a burning thirst.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sudden weakness to the want of food. At once he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt easier; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thoughts became clear.
<p/>'' All that's nonsense,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said hopefully, <div class="bookquote">``and there is nothing in it all to worry about! It's simply physical derangement.
<p/>Just a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will is firm!
<p/>But in spite of this scornful reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was by now looking cheerful as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) gazed round in a friendly way at the people in the room.
<p/>Phew, how utterly petty it all is!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But even at that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also not normal.
<p/>Besides the two drunken men he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time.
<p/>The persons still in the tavern were a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so, sitting before a pot of beer, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion, a huge, stout man with a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very drunk: and had dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began as though in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleep, cracking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms wide apart and the upper part of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body bounding about on the bench, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hummed some meaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these: <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife a year he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fondly loved His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife a--
<p/>There were few people at the time in the tavern. Their departure left the room quiet and rather empty. a year he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--fondly loved.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Or suddenly waking up again: <div class="bookquote">``Walking along the crowded row He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met the one he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But no one shared his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enjoyment: his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) silent companion looked with positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations.
<p/>There was another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government clerk. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pot and looking round at the company.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too, appeared to be in some agitation. CHAPTER II Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) avoided society of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt a desire to be with other people.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy excitement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the surroundings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was glad now to stay in the tavern.
<p/>The master of the establishment was in another room, but he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) frequently came down some steps into the main room, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) jaunty, tarred boots with red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) person.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat, with no cravat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) whole face seemed smeared with oil like an iron lock.
<p/>At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted.
<p/>On the counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad.
<p/>It was insufferably close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.
<p/>Something new seemed to be taking place within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and with it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt a sort of thirst for company. There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the first moment, before a word is spoken.
<p/>Such was the impression made on Raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), who looked like a retired clerk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked repeatedly at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring persistently at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), obviously anxious to enter into conversation.
<p/>At the other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) were used to their company, and weary of it, showing a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and culture inferior to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own, with whom it would be useless for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to converse.
<p/>The young man often recalled this impression afterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height, and stoutly built.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, bloated from continual drinking, was of a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks.
<p/>But there was something very strange in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); there was a light in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes as though of intense feeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the same time there was a gleam of something like madness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was wearing an old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing except one, and that one he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had buttoned, evidently clinging to this last trace of respectability.
<p/>Like a clerk, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chin looked like a stiff greyish brush.
<p/>A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots and stains, protruded from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) canvas waistcoat. And there was something respectable and like an official about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner too.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was restless; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ruffled up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair and from time to time let his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head drop into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands dejectedly resting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ragged elbows on the stained and sticky table.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and resolutely: <div class="bookquote">``May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?
<p/>Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not accustomed to drinking.
<p/>I have always respected education when in conjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular counsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor.
<p/>No, I am studying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>answered the young man, somewhat surprised at the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly addressed.
<p/>In spite of the momentary desire he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had just been feeling for company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) felt immediately his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached or attempted to approach him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>).
<p/>I make bold to inquire--have you been in the service?'' '' '' A student then, or formerly a student,'' cried the clerk.
<p/>'' Just what I thought! I'm a man of experience, immense experience, sir,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers in self-approval.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up, staggered, took up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jug and glass, and sat down beside the young man, facing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a little sideways.
<p/>'' You've been a student or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me...'' He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was drunk, but spoke fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) sentences and drawling his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) words.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) pounced upon Raskolnikov as greedily as though he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) too had not spoken to a soul for a month. <div class="bookquote">``Honoured sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) began almost with solemnity, <div class="bookquote">``poverty is not a vice, that's a true saying.
<p/>Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue, and that that's even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a vice.
<p/>For beggary a man is not chased out of human society with a stick, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary
<p/>In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but in beggary--never--no one. I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself.
<p/>Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and my wife is a very different matter from me!
<p/>Allow me to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Hence the pot-house! Do you understand? '' No, I have not happened to,'' answered Raskolnikov. '' What do you mean?'' ''
<p/>Well, I've just come from one and it's the fifth night I've slept so... '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) glass, emptied it and paused.
<p/>Bits of hay were in fact clinging to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) clothes and sticking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hair. It seemed quite probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had not undressed or washed for the last five days.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black nails. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest.
<p/>The innkeeper came down from the upper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the <div class="bookquote">``funny fellow''  (<font color='red'><b>The innkeeper</b></font>)</div>and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.
<p/>Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) had most likely acquired his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in the tavern.
<p/>This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order at home.
<p/>The boys at the counter fell to sniggering. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify themselves and even if possible obtain consideration.
<p/>'' Funny fellow!'' pronounced the innkeeper. '' And why don't you work, why aren't you at your duty, if you are in the service?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marmeladov/Mr. Marmeladov</b></font>)</div>Marmeladov went on, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) who put that question to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>'' Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache to think what a useless worm I am?
<p/>A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov beat my wife with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) own hands, and I lay drunk, didn't I suffer? Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you...
<p/>hm... well, to petition hopelessly for a loan?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you will get nothing by it.
<p/>You know, for instance, beforehand with positive certainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will on no consideration give you money; and
<p/>But Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that's what is done now in England, where there is political economy.
<p/>indeed I ask you why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)? For he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) knows of course that I shan't pay it back. From compassion? Why, I ask you, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) give it to me?
<p/>And yet though I know beforehand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) won't, I set off to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) and... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why do you go? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>put in Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man must have somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must go somewhere!
<p/>When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket, then I had to go... -LRB-for my daughter has a yellow passport-RRB-,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on hurriedly and with apparent composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled--<div class="bookquote">``No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of their heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all that is secret is made open.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the innkeeper</b></font>)</div>No matter, sir, no matter! '' And I accept it all, not with contempt, but with humility. So be it!
<p/>So be it! ' Behold the man!' Excuse me, young man, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not
<p/>can you but dare you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig? '' The young man did not answer a word.
<p/>Well,'' the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity, after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside.
<p/>I have the semblance of a beast, but Katerina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer's daughter.
<p/>Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is a woman of a noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education.
<p/>'' '' Well, so be it , I am a pig, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is a lady! And yet... oh, if only she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) felt for me!
<p/>Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man ought to have at least one place where people feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! But Katerina Ivanovna, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is magnanimous, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is unjust....
<p/>And yet, although I realise that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pulls my hair she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) only does it out of pity--for I repeat without being ashamed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pulls my hair, young man,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--<div class="bookquote">``but, my God, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would but once....
<p/>For more than once, my wish did come true and more than once she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a beast by nature!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But no, no! It's all in vain and it's no use talking! No use talking! <div class="bookquote">``Rather!''  (<font color='red'><b>innkeeper</b></font>)</div>assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) fist resolutely on the table.
<p/>Not her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) shoes--that would be more or less in the order of things, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) stockings, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) stockings I have sold for drink!
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) long ago, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) own property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) caught cold this winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too.
<p/>We have three little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till night; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s been used to cleanliness from a child.
<p/>'' Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) very stockings for drink? But her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) chest is weak and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has a tendency to consumption
<p/>and I feel it! Do you suppose I don't feel it? And the more I drink the more I feel it.
<p/>That's why I drink too. I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer twice as much!''
<p/>And as though in despair he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) head down on the table. '' Young man,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head again, <div class="bookquote">``in your face I seem to read some trouble of mind.
<p/>For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners, who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man of feeling and education.
<p/>Know then that my wife was educated in a high-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.
<p/>When you came in I read it, and that was why I addressed you at once. The medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm...
<p/>And although she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is most continually on bad terms with the landlady, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wanted to tell someone or other of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) past honours and of the happy days that are gone.
<p/>but the certificate of merit is in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) trunk still and not long ago she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) showed it to our landlady. I don't condemn her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for it, I don't blame her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), for the one thing left her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
<p/>is recollection of the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is a lady of spirit, proud and determined.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat, but won't allow herself to be treated with disrespect.
<p/>That's why she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov's rudeness to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and so when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a beating for it, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) took to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bed more from the hurt to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feelings than from the blows.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a widow when I married her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), with three children, one smaller than the other. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) married her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and ran away with him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father's house.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was exceedingly fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband; but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) died.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) used to beat her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at the end: and although she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) paid him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) back, of which I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) speaks of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with tears and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) throws him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) up to me; and I am glad
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was left at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) death with three children in a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups and downs of all sort, I don't feel equal to describing it even.
<p/>, I am glad that, though only in imagination, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should think of herself as having once been happy.... Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) relations had all thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) off.
<p/>And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering.
<p/>You can judge the extremity of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) calamities, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), a woman of education and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my wife.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was proud, too, excessively proud.... But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) married me! For she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had nowhere to turn!
<p/>Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No, that you don't understand yet....
<p/>And for a whole year, I performed my duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tapped the jug with his (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) finger-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``for I have feelings.
<p/>But even so, I could not please her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and then I lost my place too, and that through no fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch it!...
<p/>It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent capital, adorned with innumerable monuments.
<p/>Here I obtained a situation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This time it was through my own fault
<p/>We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel's; and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.
<p/>I lost it: for my weakness had come out.... There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and disorder, a perfect Bedlam...
<p/>And meanwhile my daughter by my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) step-mother whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was growing up, I won't speak of.
<p/>hm... yes... For, though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is a spirited lady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it's no use going over that!
<p/>I did make an effort four years ago to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) a course of geography and universal history, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we had no suitable books, and what books we had...
<p/>Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. hm, anyway we have not even those now, so all our instruction came to an end.
<p/>Since she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has attained years of maturity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has read other books of romantic tendency and of late she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had read with great interest a book she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes' Physiology--
<p/>We stopped at Cyrus of Persia. do you know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that's the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) education.
<p/>And now may I venture to address you, honoured sir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work?
<p/>Not fifteen farthings a day can she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) earn, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is respectable and has no special talent and that without putting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) work down for an instant!
<p/>And what's more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)?--has not to this day paid her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for the half-dozen linen shirts she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and drove her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) roughly away, stamping and reviling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), on the pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were put in askew.
<p/>And Katerina Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hands, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cheeks flushed red, as they always are in that disease: `Here you live with us,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), `you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.'
<p/>And much she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little ones for three days!
<p/>And there are the little ones hungry.... I was lying at the time... well, what of it! I was lying drunk
<p/>and I heard my Sonia speaking -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is a gentle creature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin little face-RRB-.
<p/>And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very well known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) through the landlady. '
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said: `Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing like that?' And why not?' said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer, `you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was not herself when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) spoke, but driven to distraction by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) illness and the crying of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) than anything else....
<p/>But don't blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), don't blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), honoured sir, don't blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)! For that's Katerina Ivanovna's character, and when children cry, even from hunger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) falls to beating them at once.
<p/>At six o'clock I saw Sonia get up, put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) kerchief and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cape, and go out of the room and about nine o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) came back.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) did not utter a word, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) did not even look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) simply picked up our big green drap de dames shawl -LRB-we have a shawl, made of drap de dames -RRB-, put it over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) head and face and lay down on the bed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face to the wall; only her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) little shoulders and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) body kept shuddering....
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) walked straight up to Katerina Ivanovna and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) laid thirty roubles on the table before her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) in silence. And I went on lying there, just as before....
<p/>And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence go up to Sonia's little bed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) knees all the evening kissing Sonia's feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell asleep in each other's arms... together, together...
<p/>yes... and I... lay drunk. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Marmeladov stopped short, as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) voice had failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) hurriedly filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) glass, drank, and cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) throat.
<p/>Since then, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) went on after a brief pause--<div class="bookquote">``Since then, owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by evil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) had been treated with want of respect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take a yellow ticket, and owing to that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) is unable to go on living with us.
<p/>For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it -LRB-though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovna</b></font>) had backed up Darya Frantsovna before-RRB- and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>hm.... All the trouble between him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia's account. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) was for making up to Sonia himself
<p/>and then all of a sudden he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) dignity: ' how,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>), `can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?'
<p/>And Katerina Ivanovna would not let it pass, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) stood up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)... and so that's how it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) comforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) all she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) can....
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has a room at the Kapernaumovs' the tailors, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) lodges with them; Kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) numerous family have cleft palates too.
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one room, but Sonia has her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) own, partitioned off....
<p/>Then I got up in the morning, and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch.
<p/>Hm... yes... very poor people and all with cleft palates... yes. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Afanasyvitch</b></font>)? No? Well, then, it's a man of God you don't know.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is wax... wax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) eyes were dim when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) heard my story. '
<p/>Marmeladov, once already you have deceived my expectations... I'll take you once more on my own responsibility'--that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) said, `remember,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) said, '
<p/>I kissed the dust at his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) feet--in thought only, for in reality he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of modern political and enlightened ideas.
<p/>I returned home, and when I announced that I'd been taken back into the service and should receive a salary, heavens, what a to-do there was!...
<p/>At that moment a whole party of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven singing
<p/>and now you can go.' '' Marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. <div class="bookquote">``The Hamlet''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were heard in the entry. The room was filled with noise.
<p/>The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers. Marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) story.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) became more and more drunk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) became more and more talkative.
<p/>The recollection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>), and was positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) face.
<p/>As soon as Katerina Ivanovna and Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the kingdom of Heaven.
<p/>Raskolnikov listened attentively. '' That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but abuse.
<p/>Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. ' Semyon Zaharovitch is tired with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) work at the office, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is resting, shh!'
<p/>They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They began to get real cream for me, do you hear that?
<p/>And how they managed to get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty copecks, I can't guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent, a uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and a half.
<p/>The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with horse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then.
<p/>none at all, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) got herself up as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) were going on a visit; and not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'d anything to do it with, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) smartened herself up with nothing at all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'d done her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hair nicely, put on a clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was, quite a different person
<p/>Sonia, my little darling, had only helped with money `for the time,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) said, `it won't do for me to come and see you too often.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had not any dresses... , she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was younger and better looking. After dark maybe when no one can see.' Do you hear, do you hear?
<p/>I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovna</b></font>) could not resist then asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovna</b></font>) in to coffee.
<p/>Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again, now, and receiving a salary,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovna</b></font>), `and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) went himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) excellency and his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) excellency himself came out to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), made all the others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) study.'
<p/>To be sure,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), `Semyon Zaharovitch, remembering your past services,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), `and in spite of your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and since moreover we've got on badly without you,' -LRB-do you hear, do you hear;-RRB- `and so
<p/>For two hours they were sitting, whispering together. ' Do you hear, do you hear? ' ,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), 'I rely now on your word as a gentleman.'
<p/>And all that, let me tell you, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has simply made up for herself, and not simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) believes it all herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) amuses herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own fancies, upon my word she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does!
<p/>Six days ago when I brought her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles forty copecks altogether--she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) called me her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) poppet: `poppet,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), `my little poppet.'
<p/>And I don't blame her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for it, no, I don't blame her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!... And when we were by ourselves, you understand? You would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a husband, would you?...
<p/>Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pinched my cheek, `my little poppet,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). '' Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) chin began to twitch.
<p/>The tavern, the degraded appearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of spirits, and yet this poignant love for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) wife and children bewildered his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) listener.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) controlled himself however. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt vexed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had come here. <div class="bookquote">``Honoured sir, honoured sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marmeladov/Mr. Marmeladov</b></font>)</div>cried Marmeladov recovering himself--<div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir
<p/>, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to others, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the trivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.
<p/>And the whole of that heavenly day of my life and the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would arrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should give her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour and restore her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) to the bosom of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) family....
<p/>For I can feel it all.... And a great deal more.... Quite excusable, sir. Well, then, sir''  (<font color='red'><b>Marmeladov/Mr. Marmeladov</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort of start, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) head and gazed intently at his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) listener-RRB-
<p/>``well, on the very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five days ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night, I stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) box, took out what was left of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look at me, all of you!
<p/>It's the fifth day since I left home, and they are looking for me there and it's the end of my employment, and my uniform is lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge.
<p/>Marmeladov struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) fist, clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) teeth, closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) eyes and leaned heavily with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) elbow on the table.
<p/>But a minute later his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and affectation of bravado, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said: <div class="bookquote">``This morning I went to see Sonia
<p/>I exchanged it for the garments I have on... and it's the end of everything!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>, I went to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) for a pick-me-up!
<p/>He-he-he!'' '' You don't say she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) gave it to you? '' cried one of the new-comers; he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) shouted the words and went off into a guffaw.
<p/>'' This very quart was bought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) money,'' Marmeladov declared, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. '' Thirty copecks she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) gave me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) own hands, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) last, all she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had, as I saw....
<p/>Not on earth, but up yonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don't blame them, they don't blame them!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) said nothing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) only looked at me without a word.... But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don't blame!
<p/>Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) needs them now, eh? What do you think, my dear sir? For now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)'s got to keep up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) appearance.
<p/>, you see, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) must have things; petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) foot when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has to step over a puddle.
<p/>It costs money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you understand? And there's pomatum, too Do you understand, sir, do you understand what all that smartness means?
<p/>And here I, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) own father, here I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking it!
<p/>And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man like me, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not?
<p/>Tell me, sir, are you sorry or not? He-he-he! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have filled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glass, but there was no drink left.
<p/>The pot was empty. '' What are you to be pitied for?'' shouted the tavern-keeper who was again near them. Shouts of laughter and even oaths followed.
<p/>The laughter and the oaths came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged government clerk.
<p/>'' To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied? '' Marmeladov suddenly declaimed, standing up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) arm outstretched, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) had been only waiting for that question.
<p/>'' Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there's nothing to pity me for! I ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied!
<p/>Crucify me, oh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be crucified, for it's not merry-making I seek but
<p/>It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) will pity us
<p/>Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all things, He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) is the One, He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) too is the judge.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) will come in that day and He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) will ask: `Where is the daughter who gave herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cross, consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another?
<p/>tears and tribulation! ... Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been sweet to me? Where is the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) earthly father, undismayed by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) beastliness?'
<p/>And He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will say, `Come to me! I have already forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much...'
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will forgive my Sonia , He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will forgive, I know it... I felt it in my heart when I was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) just now!
<p/>And He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will judge and will forgive all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) has done with all of them, then He (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) will summon us. '
<p/>You too come forth,' He (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) will say, `Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come forth, ye children of shame!'
<p/>And He (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) will say unto us, `Ye are swine, made in the Image of the Beast and with his (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) mark; but come ye also!'
<p/>And we shall all come forth, without shame and shall stand before him (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>). And the wise ones and those of understanding will say, `Oh Lord, why dost Thou receive these men?'
<p/>And He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will say, `This is why I receive them, oh ye wise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this.'
<p/>And He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will hold out His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hands to us and we shall fall down before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)... and we shall weep... and we shall understand all things!
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sank down on the bench exhausted, and helpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) surroundings and plunged in deep thought.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) words had created a certain impression; there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard again.
<p/>Then we shall understand all!... and all will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) will understand.... Lord, Thy kingdom come! '' ''
<p/>That's his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) notion!'' <div class="bookquote">``Talked himself silly!''  (<font color='red'><b>A clerk</b></font>)</div>'' A fine clerk he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is! '' And so on, and so on. '' Let us go, sir,'' said Marmeladov all at once, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) head and addressing Raskolnikov--<div class="bookquote">``come along with me...
<p/>Kozel's house, looking into the yard. I'm going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had meant to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) legs than in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) speech and leaned heavily on the young man.
<p/>They had two or three hundred paces to go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and confusion as they drew nearer the house.
<p/>'' It's not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered in agitation--<div class="bookquote">``and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) will begin pulling my hair.
<p/>What does my hair matter! Bother my hair! That's what I say! Indeed it will be better if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) does begin pulling it, that's not what I am afraid of...
<p/>it's her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes I am afraid of... yes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes... the red on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cheeks, too, frightens me... and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) breathing too....
<p/>Have you noticed how people in that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened of the children's crying, too....
<p/>For if Sonia has not taken them food... I don't know what's happened! I don't know! But blows I am not afraid of....
<p/>Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an enjoyment. In fact I can't get on without it....
<p/>It's better so. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) strike me, it relieves her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) heart... it's better so... There is the house. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do.
<p/>Lead the way! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircase got darker and darker as they went up.
<p/>It was nearly eleven o'clock and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was quite dark at the top of the stairs.
<p/>A very poor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end; the whole of it was visible from the entrance.
<p/>A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. It was all in disorder, littered up with rags of all sorts, especially children's garments.
<p/>There was nothing in the room except two chairs and a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered.
<p/>Across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it probably was the bed. At the edge of the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick.
<p/>It appeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room, but their room was practically a passage.
<p/>The door leading to the other rooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel's flat was divided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter within.
<p/>People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lippevechsel</b></font>) was a rather tall, slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic flush in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lippevechsel</b></font>) cheeks.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lippevechsel</b></font>) was pacing up and down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lippevechsel</b></font>) little room, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lippevechsel</b></font>) hands against her (<font color='blue'><b>Lippevechsel</b></font>) chest; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lippevechsel</b></font>) lips were parched and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lippevechsel</b></font>) breathing came in nervous broken gasps.
<p/>And that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression.
<p/>Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) seemed to Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for Marmeladov....
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not heard them and did not notice them coming in. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing.
<p/>The room was close, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not opened the window; a stench rose from the staircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed.
<p/>The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting curled up on the floor with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head on the sofa.
<p/>From the inner rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kept coughing, but did not close the door. A boy a year older stood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had just had a beating.
<p/>Beside him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin, wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was trying to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), whispering something to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and doing all she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) from whimpering again.
<p/>At the same time her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) large dark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) frightened face, were watching her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother with alarm.
<p/>Marmeladov did not enter the door, but dropped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had come for.
<p/>But evidently she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was going into the next room, as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had to pass through hers to get there.
<p/>Taking no further notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walked towards the outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knees in the doorway.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arm, as thin as a stick, was round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother's neck. <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried out in a frenzy, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has come back!
<p/>The criminal! the monster!... And where is the money? What's in your pocket, show me! And your clothes are all different!
<p/>Where are your clothes? Where is the money! Speak! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fell to searching him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Marmeladov submissively and obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search.
<p/>Not a farthing was there. '' Where is the money? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried--<div class="bookquote">``Mercy on us, can he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) have drunk it all?
<p/>There were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and in a fury she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) by the hair and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) into the room.
<p/>This does not hurt me, but is a positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) called out, shaken to and fro by his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) hair and even once striking the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>Marmeladov seconded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) efforts by meekly crawling along on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) knees. '' And this is a consolation to me! The child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry.
<p/>The boy in the corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sister in violent terror, almost in a fit.
<p/>The eldest girl was shaking like a leaf. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s drunk it! he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s drunk it all,'' the poor woman screamed in despair--<div class="bookquote">``and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clothes are gone!
<p/>And they are hungry, hungry!'' (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>--and wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pointed to the children. '' Oh, accursed life! And you, are you not ashamed?''--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pounced all at once upon Raskolnikov--<div class="bookquote">``from the tavern!
<p/>Have you been drinking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)? You have been drinking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), too! Go away! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>The young man was hastening away without uttering a word.
<p/>The inner door was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust themselves in at the doorway.
<p/>Further in could be seen figures in dressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of them with cards in their hands.
<p/>They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill outcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lippevechsel</b></font>) way amongst them and trying to restore order after her (<font color='blue'><b>Lippevechsel</b></font>) own fashion and for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her (<font color='blue'><b>Lippevechsel</b></font>) with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) went out, Raskolnikov had time to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pocket, to snatch up the coppers he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had received in exchange for his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) rouble in the tavern and to lay them unnoticed on the window.
<p/>They were particularly diverted, when Marmeladov, dragged about by his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) hair, shouted that it was a consolation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>). Afterwards on the stairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) mind and would have gone back.
<p/>But reflecting that it would be impossible to take it back now and that in any case he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) would not have taken it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) dismissed it with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) hand and went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) lodging.
<p/>'' What a stupid thing I've done,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) thought to himself, <div class="bookquote">``they have Sonia and I want it myself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>And maybe Sonia herself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting big game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust to-morrow except for my money.
<p/>Sonia wants pomatum too,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) walked along the street, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) laughed malignantly--<div class="bookquote">``such smartness costs money.... Hm! Hurrah for Sonia!
<p/>What a mine they've dug there! And they're making the most of it! Yes, they are making the most of it!
<p/>They've wept over it and grown used to it. Man grows used to everything, the scoundrel! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) sank into thought.
<p/>What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the whole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers
<p/>'' And what if I am wrong,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried suddenly after a moment's thought. '' and it's all as it should be.
<p/>'' CHAPTER III He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleep had not refreshed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked with hatred at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room.
<p/>It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty yellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would knock his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head against the ceiling.
<p/>The furniture was in keeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books; the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long untouched.
<p/>A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and half the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but was now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed.
<p/>Often he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went to sleep on it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) old student's overcoat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head on one little pillow, under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heaped up all the linen he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster.
<p/>It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length. A little table stood in front of the sofa.
<p/>It would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to Raskolnikov in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) present state of mind
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell, and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and looked sometimes into his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) room made him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) writhe with nervous irritation.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in meals, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had not yet thought of expostulating with her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went without his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) dinner.
<p/>Nastasya, the cook and only servant, was rather pleased at the lodger's mood and had entirely given up sweeping and doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) room, only once a week or so she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) would stray into his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) room with a broom.
<p/>this was positively agreeable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated upon one thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) waked him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) up that day.
<p/>'' Get up, why are you asleep? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' It's past nine, I have brought you some tea; will you have a cup?
<p/>I should think you're fairly starving? '' Raskolnikov opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes, started and recognised Nastasya. '' From the landlady, eh?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked, slowly and with a sickly face sitting up on the sofa.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) set before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it.
<p/>Here, Nastasya, take it please,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, fumbling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pocket -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had slept in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) clothes-RRB- and taking out a handful of coppers--<div class="bookquote">``run and buy me a loaf.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>coppers</b></font>)</div>From the landlady, indeed!'' '' And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at the pork-butcher's.'' '' The loaf I'll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn't you rather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage?
<p/>When the soup had been brought, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had begun upon it, Nastasya sat down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) on the sofa and began chatting.
<p/>It's capital soup, yesterday's. I saved it for you yesterday, but you came in late. It's fine soup. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was a country peasant-woman and a very talkative one.
<p/>'' Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) scowled. '' To the police? What does she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) want?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't pay her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) money and you won't turn out of the room. That's what she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) wants, to be sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>The devil straw</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>The devil, that's the last straw,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) muttered, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) teeth, <div class="bookquote">``no, that would not suit me... just now. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) is a fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) added aloud.
<p/>But why, if you are so clever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it?
<p/>'' I'll go and talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to-day.'' <div class="bookquote">``Fool she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) is and no mistake, just as I am. One time you used to go out, you say, to teach children.
<p/>But why is it you do nothing now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am doing... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly. '' What are you doing?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Work...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What sort of work?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) answered seriously after a pause. Nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was given to laughter and when anything amused her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) laughed inaudibly, quivering and shaking all over till she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) felt ill.
<p/>'' And have you made much money by your thinking? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) managed to articulate at last. '' One can't go out to give lessons without boots.
<p/>And I'm sick of it. '' <div class="bookquote">``Don't quarrel with your bread and butter.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They pay so little for lessons. What's the use of a few coppers?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) answered, reluctantly, as though replying to his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) own thought. '' And you want to get a fortune all at once?
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) strangely. '' Yes, I want a fortune,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) answered firmly, after a brief pause. '' Don't be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me!
<p/>Shall I get you the loaf or not?'' '' As you please. '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, I forgot! A letter came for you yesterday when you were out.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A letter? for me! from whom?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't say. I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it.
<p/>Will you pay me back?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then bring it to me, for God's sake, bring it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>cried Raskolnikov greatly excited--<div class="bookquote">``good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>A minute later the letter was brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>That was it: from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother, from the province of R--. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned pale when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) took it. It was a long while since he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had received a letter, but another feeling also suddenly stabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart.
<p/>'' Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness' sake; here are your three copecks, but for goodness' sake, make haste and go!
<p/>The letter was quivering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not want to open it in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) presence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wanted to be left alone with this letter.
<p/>When Nastasya had gone out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lifted it quickly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lips and kissed it; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) gazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear and familiar, of the mother who had once taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to read and write.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) opened it; it was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets of note paper were covered with very small handwriting.
<p/>My dear Rodya,'' wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother--<div class="bookquote">``it's two months since I last had a talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me awake at night, thinking.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>mother months</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) delayed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) seemed almost afraid of something. '' But I am sure you will not blame me for my inevitable silence.
<p/>You know how I love you; you are all we have to look to, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope,
<p/>What a grief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university some months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had lost your lessons and your other work!
<p/>our one stay. How could I help you out of my hundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sent you four months ago
<p/>I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension, from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) is a kind-hearted man and was a friend of your father's too.
<p/>But having given him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was paid off and that is only just done, so that I've been unable to send you anything all this time.
<p/>But now, thank God, I believe I shall be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate ourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you.
<p/>In the first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be separated in the future.
<p/>Thank God, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sufferings are over, but I will tell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you.
<p/>When you wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great deal to put up with in the Svidrigraïlovs' house, when you wrote that and asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to you?
<p/>If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have thrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all the way,
<p/>for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not let your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I do?
<p/>What made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles in advance when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took the place as governess in their family, on condition of part of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) salary being deducted every month, and so it was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.
<p/>And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. This sum -LRB-now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya-RRB-
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly then and which you received from us last year.
<p/>We deceived you then, writing that this money came from Dounia's savings, but that was not so, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves you and what a heart she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has.
<p/>But I don't want to go into all those painful details, so as not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over.
<p/>In short, in spite of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov's wife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time, especially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) old regimental habits, was under the influence of Bacchus.
<p/>At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at table.... And how do you think it was all explained later on?
<p/>Would you believe that the crazy fellow had conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed it under a show of rudeness and contempt.
<p/>Possibly he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was ashamed and horrified himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own flighty hopes, considering his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) years and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) being the father of a family; and that made him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) angry with Dounia.
<p/>But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) lost all control and had the face to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) all sorts of inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to another estate of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), or even abroad.
<p/>And possibly, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hoped by his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) rude and sneering behaviour to hide the truth from others. You can imagine all she (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went through!
<p/>To leave her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) situation at once was impossible not only on account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia would have been the cause of a rupture in the family.
<p/>There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks.
<p/>And it would have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been inevitable. You know Dounia, of course; you know how clever she (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is and what a strong will she (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has.
<p/>Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases she (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has the fortitude to maintain her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) firmness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did not even write to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were constantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly.
<p/>Marfa Petrovna accidentally overheard her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) husband imploring Dounia in the garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw the blame upon her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), believing her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to be the cause of it all.
<p/>An awful scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna went so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was shouting at her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant's cart, into which they flung all her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) things, her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) linen and her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) clothes, all pell-mell, without folding it up and packing it.
<p/>And a heavy shower of rain came on, too, and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen versts into town.
<p/>Only think now what answer could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and what could I have written?
<p/>I was in despair; I dared not write to you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified and indignant, and yet what could you do?
<p/>You could only perhaps ruin yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not.
<p/>For a whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about us.
<p/>All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the street, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch, so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave.
<p/>All this was set going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) in every family.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that month she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) was continually coming into the town, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) is rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) family affairs and particularly of complaining to all and each of her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) husband--which is not at all right--
<p/>so in a short time she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) had spread her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) story not only in the town, but over the whole surrounding district.
<p/>It made me ill, but Dounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up!
<p/>But by God's mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr. Svidrigaïlov returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) senses and repented and, probably feeling sorry for Dounia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and unmistakable proof of Dounia's innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia had been forced to write and give to him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), before Marfa Petrovna came upon them in the garden.
<p/>This letter, which remained in Mr. Svidrigaïlov's hands after her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) departure, she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) had written to refuse personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was entreating her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>).
<p/>In that letter she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) reproached him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) with great heat and indignation for the baseness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was the father and head of a family and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) how infamous it was of him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl, unhappy enough already.
<p/>Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot read it without tears.
<p/>Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too, cleared Dounia's reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more than Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case with servants.
<p/>Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and `again crushed' as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said herself to us, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was completely convinced of Dounia's innocence.
<p/>The very next day, being Sunday, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went straight to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) strength to bear this new trial and to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) duty.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept bitterly and, fully penitent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) embraced Dounia and besought her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>).
<p/>The same morning without any delay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) went round to all the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) asserted in the most flattering terms Dounia's innocence and the nobility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) feelings and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) behavior.
<p/>What was more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) showed and read to everyone the letter in Dounia's own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and even allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was superfluous.
<p/>In this way she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was busy for several days in driving about the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence having been given to others.
<p/>And therefore they had to take turns, so that in every house she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was expected before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) arrived, and everyone knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading of it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their own houses and in other people's.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is an angel! In my opinion a great deal, a very great deal of all this was unnecessary; but that's Marfa Petrovna's character.
<p/>Anyway she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia's reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really began to feel sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); it was really treating the crazy fellow too harshly.
<p/>All of a sudden everyone began to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) with marked respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may say, our whole fortunes are now transformed.
<p/>Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) refused. You must know, dear Rodya, that Dounia has a suitor and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has already consented to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/>I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been arranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who has been very active in bringing the match about.
<p/>And you could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This was how it happened. It began with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) expressing through her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) desire to make our acquaintance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sent us a letter in which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) very courteously made an offer and begged for a speedy and decided answer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is a very busy man and is in a great hurry to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/>At first, of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly and unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is a well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has two posts in the government and has already made his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fortune.
<p/>It is true that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is forty-five years old, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be thought attractive by women, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is altogether a very respectable and presentable man, only he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.
<p/>And beware, dear Rodya, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) comes to Petersburg, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shortly will do, beware of judging him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) too hastily and severely, as your way is, if there is anything you do not like in him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) at first sight.
<p/>But possibly that may only be the impression he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) makes at first sight. I give you this warning, although I feel sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will make a favourable impression upon you.
<p/>Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas, which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards.
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first visit, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told us that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a practical man, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shares, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expressed it, many of the convictions `of our most rising generation' and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is an opponent of all prejudices.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said a good deal more, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems a little conceited and likes to be listened to, but this is scarcely a vice.
<p/>I, of course, understood very little of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not a man of great education, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is clever and seems to be good-natured.
<p/>And Pyotr Petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man. You know your sister's character, Rodya. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is a resolute, sensible, patient and generous girl, but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has a passionate heart, as I know very well.
<p/>Of course, there is no great love either on his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) side, or on hers, but Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make it her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) duty to make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband happy who on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) side will make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) happiness his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) care.
<p/>Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste.
<p/>Besides he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is a man of great prudence and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will see, to be sure, of himself, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even certain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in the happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) struck me, for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come from his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is.
<p/>For instance, at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) second visit, after he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had received Dounia's consent, in the course of conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) declared that before making Dounia's acquaintance, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mind to marry a girl of good reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced poverty, because, as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) benefactor.
<p/>I must add that he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) expressed it more nicely and politely than I have done, for I have forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) actual phrases and only remember the meaning.
<p/>And, besides, it was obviously not said of design, but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) tried afterwards to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike me as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia.
<p/>Dounia did not sleep all night before she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) got out of bed and was walking up and down the room all night; at last she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knelt down before the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) told me that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had decided.
<p/>I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for Petersburg, where he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has a great deal of business, and he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wants to open a legal bureau.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has been occupied for many years in conducting civil and commercial litigation, and only the other day he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) won an important case.
<p/>But Dounia was vexed, and answered that `words are not deeds,' and that, of course, is perfectly true. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has to be in Petersburg because he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has an important case before the Senate.
<p/>So, Rodya dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may be of the greatest use to you, in every way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that your future is marked out and assured for you.
<p/>Oh, if only this comes to pass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a providential blessing.
<p/>Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was cautious in his (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answer, and said that, of course, as he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not get on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the duties -LRB-as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!-RRB-
<p/>but then he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave you time for work at his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) office. The matter dropped for the time, but Dounia is thinking of nothing else now.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) has been in a sort of fever for the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr Petrovitch's business, which might well be, seeing that you are a student of law.
<p/>I am in complete agreement with her (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>), Rodya, and share all her (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of realising them.
<p/>And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch's evasiveness, very natural at present -LRB-since he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) does not know you-RRB-, Dounia is firmly persuaded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) will gain everything by her (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) good influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) future husband; this she (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) is reckoning upon.
<p/>Of course we are careful not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch, especially of your becoming his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) partner.
<p/>Nor has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) of the great hopes we have of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself, later on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of himself, -LRB-as though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could refuse Dounia that-RRB- the more readily since you may by your own efforts become his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) right hand in the office, and receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your own work.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is a practical man and might take this very coldly, it might all seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) simply a day-dream. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this
<p/>And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when you first meet him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>When Dounia spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with enthusiasm about you, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) close, for oneself, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked forward to forming his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own opinion when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) makes your acquaintance.
<p/>, I think that perhaps for some reasons -LRB-nothing to do with Pyotr Petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish, fancies-RRB-
<p/>and I quite agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dounia</b></font>). Do you know, my precious Rodya I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with them, after the wedding.
<p/>I am convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will be generous and delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter for the future, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has said nothing about it hitherto, it is simply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse.
<p/>I have noticed more than once in my life that husbands don't quite get on with their mothers-in-law, and I don't want to be the least bit in anyone's way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and Dounia.
<p/>If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most joyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter: know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of almost three years!
<p/>It is settled for certain that Dounia and I are to set off for Petersburg, exactly when I don't know, but very, very soon, possibly in a week.
<p/>It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us know when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has had time to look round him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in Petersburg.
<p/>To suit his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own arrangements he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible, even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is too soon to be ready, immediately after.
<p/>Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought of seeing you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) said one day in joke that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) would be ready to marry Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is not writing anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has so much, so much to tell you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is not going to take up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) pen now, for a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting herself
<p/>Oh, with what happiness I shall press you to my heart! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is an angel! ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) bids me send you her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) love and innumerable kisses.
<p/>But although we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much money as I can in a day or two.
<p/>I know that Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles on the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send you twenty-five or even thirty roubles.
<p/>I would send you more, but I am uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that is to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big trunk -LRB-which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)-RRB-, we must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we can't be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days.
<p/>But we have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see that the journey will not cost very much.
<p/>Now that everyone has heard that Dounia is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and It is only ninety versts from us to the railway
<p/>and we have come to an agreement with a driver we know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel quite comfortably third class.
<p/>But enough; I have covered two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole history, but so many events have happened!
<p/>So that I may very likely be able to send to you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. And now, my precious Rodya, I embrace you and send you a mother's blessing till we meet.
<p/>Love Dounia your sister, Rodya; love her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) loves you and understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) loves you beyond everything, more than herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is an angel and you, Rodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation. If only you are happy, we shall be happy.
<p/>I am afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of infidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you.
<p/>Remember, dear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used to lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those days.
<p/>Do you still say your prayers, Rodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? Good-bye , till we meet then--I embrace you warmly, warmly, with many kisses.
<p/>Almost from the first, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) read the letter, Raskolnikov's face was wet with tears; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) finished it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) face was pale and distorted and a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) lips.
<p/>'' Yours till death, <div class="bookquote">``PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) head down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long time.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) heart was beating violently, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) brain was in a turmoil. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was like a cupboard or a box.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) mind craved for space. He (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting anyone; he (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) had forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) dread.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) turned in the direction of the Vassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though hastening on some business, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) walked, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) habit was, without noticing his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the astonishment of the passers-by.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) mother's letter had been a torture to him (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>), but as regards the chief fact in it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) had felt not one moment's hesitation, even whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) was reading the letter.
<p/>The essential question was settled, and irrevocably settled, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) mind: <div class="bookquote">``Never such a marriage while I am alive and Mr. Luzhin be damned!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Many of them took him (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) to be drunk. CHAPTER IV '' The thing is perfectly clear,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) muttered to himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) decision.
<p/>'' No, mother, no, Dounia, you won't deceive me! and then they apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without me!
<p/>I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and can't be broken off; but we will see whether it can or not!
<p/>A magnificent excuse: `Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wedding has to be in post-haste, almost by express.'
<p/>and I know too what you were thinking about, when you walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before the Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother's bedroom.
<p/>No, Dounia, I see it all and I know what you want to say to me; Bitter is the ascent to Golgotha...
<p/>; you have determined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one who has a fortune -LRB-has already made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortune, that is so much more solid and impressive-RRB- a man who holds two government posts and who shares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and who seems to be kind, as Dounia herself observes.
<p/>Hm... so it is finally settled That seems beats everything! And that very Dounia for that very ' seems ' is marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!
<p/>Splendid! splendid! '' ... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about `our most rising generation'?
<p/>Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea of prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them!
<p/>I should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one another that day and night and all this time since?
<p/>Was it all put into words , or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and better not to speak of it.
<p/>Most likely it was partly like that, from mother's letter it's evident: he (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) struck her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as rude a little , and mother in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) simplicity took her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) observations to Dounia.
<p/>Who would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questions and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was sure to be vexed and `answered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) angrily.' I should think so! And why does she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) write to me, `love Dounia, Rodya, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loves you more than herself'?
<p/>Has she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son? ' You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.'
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had happened to meet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) might have murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>).
<p/>yes, that's true,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that chased each other in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) brain, <div class="bookquote">``it is true that `it needs time and care to get to know a man,' but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin.
<p/>The chief thing is he (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) is 'a man of business and seems kind,' that was something, wasn't it, to send the bags and big box for them!
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bride and her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) mother are to drive in a peasant's cart covered with sacking -LRB-I know, I have been driven in it-RRB-.
<p/>Oh, mother! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Hm... A kind man, no doubt after that! No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can `travel very comfortably, third class,' for a thousand versts!
<p/>Quite right, too. One must cut one's coat according to one's cloth, but what about you, Mr. Luzhin? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is your bride....
<p/>To be sure it's a matter of business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and expenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco.
<p/>And you must be aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother has to raise money on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pension for the journey. The business man has got the better of them, too.
<p/>The luggage will cost less than their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that they don't both see all that, or is it that they don't want to see?
<p/>And they are pleased, pleased! And to think that this is only the first blossoming, and that the real fruits are to come!
<p/>But what really matters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the tone of the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage, it's a foretaste of it.
<p/>And mother too, why should she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) be so lavish? What will she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) have by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles or two `paper ones' as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says.... that old woman...
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reasons already for guessing that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not live with Dounia after the marriage, even for the first few months.
<p/>The good man has no doubt let slip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: 'I shall refuse,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) counting on what is left of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hundred and twenty roubles of pension when Afanasy Ivanovitch's debt is paid?
<p/>hm. What does she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? On whom is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reckoning then? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knits woollen shawls and embroiders cuffs, ruining her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) old eyes.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is building all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin's generosity; `he (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) will offer it of himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) will press it on me.'
<p/>And all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shawls don't add more than twenty roubles a year to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hundred and twenty, I know that. You may wait a long time for that!
<p/>That's how it always is with these Schilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan with them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will see nothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side of the picture, yet they won't face the truth till they are forced to
<p/>; the very thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with both hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool's cap on them with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own hands.
<p/>I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin has any orders of merit; I bet he (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) has the Anna in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) buttonhole and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) puts it on when he (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) goes to dine with contractors or merchants.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) will be sure to have it for his (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) wedding, too! Enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>), confound him (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>)! '' Well,... mother I don't wonder at, it's like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but
<p/>how could Dounia? Dounia darling, as though I did not know you! You were nearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then.
<p/>I knew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half years I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that `Dounia can put up with a great deal.'
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could put up with Mr. Svidrigaïlov and all the rest of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) certainly can put up with a great deal.
<p/>And now mother and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) have taken it into their heads that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can put up with Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband's bounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview.
<p/>Granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) `let it slip,' though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is a sensible man, -LRB-yet maybe it was not a slip at all, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) meant to make himself clear as soon as possible-RRB- but
<p/>Mother writes that `Dounia can put up with a great deal.' I know that very well. Dounia, Dounia? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) understands the man, of course, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) will have to live with the man.
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) would not sell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) soul, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) would not barter her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) moral freedom for comfort; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein, much less Mr. Luzhin's money.
<p/>Why! she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'d live on black bread and water No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) and... she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) is still the same, of course!
<p/>It's a bitter thing to spend one's life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German master than degrade her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) soul, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) moral dignity, by binding herself for ever to a man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) does not respect and with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) has nothing in common--for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) own advantage.
<p/>And if Mr. Luzhin had been of unalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) would never have consented to become his (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) legal concubine.
<p/>Yes, there's no denying, the Svidrigaïlovs are a bitter pill! Why is she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) consenting then? What's the point of it? What's the answer?
<p/>It's clear enough: for herself, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) comfort, to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) would not sell herself, but for someone else she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) is doing it!
<p/>For one she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) loves, for one she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) adores, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) will sell herself! That's what it all amounts to; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) brother, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) will sell herself!
<p/>In such cases, `we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,' freedom, peace, conscience even, all, all are brought into the market.
<p/>More than that, we become casuists, we learn to be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we can persuade ourselves that it is one's duty for a good object.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) will sell everything! Let my life go, if only my dear ones may be happy! That's just like us, it's as clear as daylight.
<p/>Oh, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) can ensure his (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) happiness, keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) in the university, make him (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) a partner in the office, make his (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) whole future secure; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) may even be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end his (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) life a famous man!
<p/>It's clear that Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else. But my mother? It's all Rodya, precious Rodya, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) first born!
<p/>For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! Oh, loving, over-partial hearts! Why, for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sake we would not shrink even from Sonia's fate.
<p/>Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long as the world lasts. Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both of you?
<p/>Is it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense in it? And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia's life is no worse than life with Mr. Luzhin. '
<p/>There can be no question of love,' mother writes. And what if there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion, contempt, repulsion, what then?
<p/>So you will have to `keep up your appearance,' too. Is not that so? Do you understand what that smartness means?
<p/>Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same thing as Sonia's and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case, Dounia, it's a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it's simply a question of starvation.
<p/>It has to be paid for, it has to be paid for, Dounia, this smartness. And what if it's more than you can bear afterwards, if you regret it?
<p/>The bitterness, the misery, the curses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a Marfa Petrovna. And how will your mother feel then?
<p/>Even now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is uneasy, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is worried, but then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sees it all clearly? And I? Yes, indeed, what have you taken me for?
<p/>I won't have your sacrifice, Dounia, I won't have it, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it shall not, it shall not!
<p/>I won't accept it!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovna</b></font>) suddenly paused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovna</b></font>) reflection and stood still. '' It shall not be? But what are you going to do to prevent it?
<p/>You'll forbid it? And what right have you? What can you promise them on your side to give you such a right?
<p/>Your whole life, your whole future, you will devote to them when you have finished your studies and obtained a post ?
<p/>Yes, we have heard all that before, and that's all words , but now? Now something must be done, now, do you understand that?
<p/>And what are you doing now? You are living upon them. They borrow on their hundred roubles pension. They borrow from the Svidrigaïlovs.
<p/>How are you going to save them from Svidrigaïlovs, from Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin , oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives for them?
<p/>In another ten years? In another ten years, mother will be blind with knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will be worn to a shadow with fasting; and my sister?
<p/>Imagine for a moment what may have become of your sister in ten years? What may happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) during those ten years?
<p/>Can you fancy? '' So he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, and finding a kind of enjoyment in it.
<p/>And yet all these questions were not new ones suddenly confronting him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>), they were old familiar aches. It was long since they had first begun to grip and rend his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Long, long ago his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and gathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had taken the form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which tortured his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer.
<p/>It was clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved questions, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) must do something, do it at once, and do it quickly.
<p/>Now his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) mother's letter had burst on him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) like a thunderclap. Anyway he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) must decide on something, or else... <div class="bookquote">``Or throw up life altogether!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) cried suddenly, in a frenzy--<div class="bookquote">``accept one's lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in oneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marmeladov/Mr. Marmeladov</b></font>)</div>Marmeladov's question came suddenly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) mind, <div class="bookquote">``for every man must have somewhere to turn....
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) did not start at the thought recurring to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) had felt beforehand , that it must come back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday's thought.
<p/>The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the thought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all, it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) suddenly became aware of this himself...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marmeladov/Mr. Marmeladov</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) gave a sudden start; another thought, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) had had yesterday, slipped back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) felt a hammering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) head, and there was a darkness before his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) looked round hurriedly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) was searching for something. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) wanted to sit down and was looking for a seat; he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) was walking along the K-- Boulevard.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) walked towards it as fast he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) could; but on the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) met with a little adventure which absorbed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) attention.
<p/>Looking for the seat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) had noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>), but at first he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) took no more notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) than of other objects that crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) path.
<p/>It had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) many times going home not to notice the road by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) was going, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) was accustomed to walk like that.
<p/>But there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>), that gradually his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) attention was riveted upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), at first reluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more intently.
<p/>There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) felt a sudden desire to find out what it was
<p/>In the first place, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appeared to be a girl quite young, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with no parasol or gloves, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms about in an absurd way.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had on a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not properly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose.
<p/>that was so strange about the woman. A little kerchief was flung about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bare throat, but lay slanting on one side.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) overtook the girl at the seat, but, on reaching it, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dropped down on it, in the corner; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head sink on the back of the seat and closed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes, apparently in extreme exhaustion.
<p/>The girl was walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drew Raskolnikov's whole attention at last. Looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) closely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw at once that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was completely drunk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) the face of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than fifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking and, as it were, swollen.
<p/>The girl seemed hardly to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was doing; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and showed every sign of being unconscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was in the street.
<p/>It was a strange and shocking sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could hardly believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was not mistaken. Raskolnikov did not sit down, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt unwilling to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and stood facing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in perplexity.
<p/>And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen paces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement.
<p/>This boulevard was never much frequented; and now, at two o'clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite deserted. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), too, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked angrily at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tried to escape his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) notice, and stood impatiently biding his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), too, had probably seen her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the distance and had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but found Raskolnikov in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) way. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) intentions were unmistakable.
<p/>The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and moustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had a sudden longing to insult this fat dandy in some way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) left the girl for a moment and walked towards the gentleman. '' Hey! You Svidrigaïlov! What do you want here?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shouted, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fists and laughing, spluttering with rage. '' What do you mean? '' the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughty astonishment.
<p/>Raskolnikov rushed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fists, without reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like himself.
<p/>'' Get away, that's what I mean. '' <div class="bookquote">``How dare you, you low fellow! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cane. But at that instant someone seized him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) from behind, and a police constable stood between them.
<p/>'' That's enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. What do you want? Who are you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) rags.
<p/>Raskolnikov looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) intently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had a straight-forward, sensible, soldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers. '' You are just the man I want,'' Raskolnikov cried, catching at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) arm.
<p/>'' I am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added, addressing the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``come along, I have something to show you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>And taking the policeman by the hand he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) towards the seat. '' Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has just come down the boulevard.
<p/>There is no telling who and what she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is, she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) does not look like a professional. It's more likely she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has been given drink and deceived somewhere...
<p/>Look at the way her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dress is torn, and the way it has been put on: she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has been dressed by somebody, she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has not dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man's hands; that's evident.
<p/>: I don't know that dandy with whom I was going to fight, I see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the first time, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too, has seen her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is doing, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very eager to get hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), to get her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) away somewhere while she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is in this state...
<p/>for the first time... you understand? and they've put her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) out into the street like that. And now look there that's certain, believe me, I am not wrong.
<p/>I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) myself watching her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and following her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), but I prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is just waiting for me to go away.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has walked away a little, and is standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can we keep her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and how are we to get her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) home?
<p/>'' The policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy to understand, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned to consider the girl.
<p/>The policeman bent over to examine her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more closely, and his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) face worked with genuine compassion. '' Ah, what a pity!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) head--<div class="bookquote">``why, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is quite a child! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has been deceived, you can see that at once.
<p/>Listen, lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) began addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``where do you live? ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>The girl opened her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) weary and sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Here,'' said Raskolnikov feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pocket and finding twenty copecks, <div class="bookquote">``here, call a cab and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) address.

<p/>I'll fetch you a cab and take you home myself. Where shall I take you, eh? Where do you live?'' <div class="bookquote">``Go away!
<p/>They won't let me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl muttered, and once more waved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand. '' Ach, ach, how shocking! It's shameful, missy, it's a shame!''
<p/>It's a difficult job,'' the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) up and down in a rapid glance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), too, must have seemed a strange figure to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>): dressed in rags and handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) money!
<p/>'' Did you meet her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) far from here? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' I tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, in the boulevard.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) only just reached the seat and sank down on it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have mercy on us!
<p/>An innocent creature like that, drunk already! She (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) has been deceived, that's a sure thing. See how her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) dress has been torn too....
<p/>Ah, the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) belongs to gentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) looks refined, too, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) were a lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) once more. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had daughters growing up like that, <div class="bookquote">``looking like ladies and refined''  (<font color='red'><b>daughters</b></font>)</div>with pretensions to gentility and smartness...
<p/>'' The chief thing is,'' Raskolnikov persisted, <div class="bookquote">``to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) out of this scoundrel's hands! Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) outrage her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>)! It's as clear as day what he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is after; ah, the brute, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is not moving off!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><p/>The gentleman heard him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and confined himself to a contemptuous look.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands we can,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the constable thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``if only she (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>)'d tell us where to take her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>), but as it is....
<p/>Raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) then walked slowly another ten paces away and again halted. Missy, hey, missy!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) intently, as though realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the direction from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) had come.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) once more. '' Oh shameful wretches, they won't let me alone! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) said, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) hand again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) walked quickly, though staggering as before. The dandy followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>), but along another avenue, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eye on her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>). ''
<p/>Don't be anxious, I won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) have her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>),'' the policeman said resolutely, and he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) set off after them. '' Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) repeated aloud, sighing. At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a complete revulsion of feeling came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>'' Hey, here!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shouted after the policeman. The latter turned round. <div class="bookquote">``Let them be! What is it to do with you?
<p/>Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Missy</b></font>) go! Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) amuse himself.

(<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>The policeman was bewildered, and stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) open-eyed.
<p/>Well!'' ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) walked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for a madman or something even worse.
<p/>Well, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) take as much from the other fellow to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to have the girl and so let it end.
<p/>Raskolnikov laughed. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) has carried off my twenty copecks,'' Raskolnikov murmured angrily when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was left alone. '' And why did I want to interfere?
<p/>Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help? Let them devour each other alive--what is to me?
<p/>How did I dare to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) twenty copecks? Were they mine?'' In spite of those strange words he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt very wretched.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sat down on the deserted seat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) found it hard to fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind on anything at that moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) longed to forget himself altogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life anew... <div class="bookquote">``Poor girl! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, looking at the empty corner where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had sat--<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will come to herself and weep, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother will find out....
<p/>And even if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) does not, the Darya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be slipping out on the sly here and there.
<p/>Then there will be the hospital directly -LRB-that's always the luck of those girls with respectable mothers, who go wrong on the sly-RRB- and then... again the hospital... drink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--a wreck, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life over at eighteen or nineteen....
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and then maybe, turn her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out of doors.... Have not I seen cases like that?
<p/>And how have they been brought to it? Why, they've all come to it like that. Ugh! But what does it matter?
<p/>A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year go... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain chaste, and not be interfered with.
<p/>That's as it should be, they tell us. A percentage! What splendid words they have; they are so scientific, so consolatory....
<p/>Once you've said `percentage' there's nothing more to worry about. If we had any other word... maybe we might feel more uneasy....
<p/>But what if Dounia were one of the percentage! Of another one if not that one? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But where am I going?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) thought suddenly. '' Strange, I came out for something. As soon as I had read the letter I came out....
<p/>I was going to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That's what it was... now I remember. What for, though? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin into my head just now?
<p/>It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at the university; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did not welcome anyone who came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), and indeed everyone soon gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) up.
<p/>That's curious. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) old comrades at the university. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) took no part in the students' gatherings, amusements or conversations.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was very poor, and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) were keeping something to himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) seemed to some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) comrades to look down upon them all as children, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) were superior in development, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and interests were beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) worked with great intensity without sparing himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was respected for this, but no one liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>). With Razumihin he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had got on, or, at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was more unreserved and communicative with him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid youth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and dignity lay concealed under that simplicity.
<p/>Indeed it was impossible to be on any other terms with Razumihin. The better of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) comrades understood this, and all were fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was extremely intelligent, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was of striking appearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength. One night, when out in a festive company, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had with one blow laid a gigantic policeman on his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) back.
<p/>There was no limit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) drinking powers, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) could abstain from drink altogether ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) sometimes went too far in his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) pranks; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) could do without pranks altogether.
<p/>Another thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), and it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) could lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was very poor, and kept himself entirely on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) could earn by work of one sort or another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) knew of no end of resources by which to earn money.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) spent one whole winter without lighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) stove, and used to declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) liked it better, because one slept more soundly in the cold.
<p/>For the present he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), too, had been obliged to give up the university, but it was only for a time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was working with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) might to save enough to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) studies again.
<p/>About two months before, they had met in the street, but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) might not be observed.
<p/>Raskolnikov had not been to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even know his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) address. And though Razumihin noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) by, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) did not want to annoy him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>).
<p/>Of course, I've been meaning lately to go to Razumihin's to ask for work, to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) to get me lessons or something...
<p/>Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) gets me lessons, suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) shares his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) last farthing with me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) has any farthings, so that I could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons
<p/>CHAPTER V '' '' Raskolnikov thought, <div class="bookquote">``but what help can he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) be to me now? ... hm... Well and what then?
<p/>What shall I do with the few coppers I earn? That's not what I want now. It's really absurd for me to go to Razumihin....
<p/>The question why he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was now going to Razumihin agitated him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) even more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was himself aware; he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) kept uneasily seeking for some sinister significance in this apparently ordinary action.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>'' Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by means of Razumihin alone?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) pondered and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) forehead, and, strange to say, after long musing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic thought came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) asked himself in perplexity. '' Hm... to Razumihin's ,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) said all at once, calmly, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had reached a final determination.
<p/>I shall go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)... on the next day after It, when It will be over and everything will begin afresh...
<p/>'' I shall go to Razumihin's of course, but... not now. '' And suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) realised what he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was thinking. ''
<p/>After It,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) shouted, jumping up from the seat, <div class="bookquote">``but is It really going to happen? Is it possible it really will happen?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) left the seat, and went off almost at a run; he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) meant to turn back, homewards, but the thought of going home suddenly filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) with intense loathing; in that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), all this had for a month past been growing up in him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) walked on at random.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) feel shivering; in spite of the heat he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) felt cold.
<p/>With a kind of effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) began almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all the objects before him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), as though looking for something to distract his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) attention; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into brooding.
<p/>When with a start he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) head again and looked round, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) forgot at once what he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had just been thinking about and even where he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was going.
<p/>In this way he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came out on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the islands.
<p/>The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) weary eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) in and weighed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness, no stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid irritability.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) stood still before a brightly painted summer villa standing among green foliage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) gazed through the fence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) saw in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies, and children running in the gardens.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was met, too, by luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) watched them with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) sight.
<p/>The flowers especially caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) attention; he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) gazed at them longer than at anything. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) stood still and counted his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) money; he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had thirty copecks.
<p/>Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the letter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs yesterday,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) soon forgot with what object he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had taken the money out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was hungry.... Going into the tavern he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) drank a glass of vodka and ate a pie of some sort.
<p/>It was a long while since he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) at once, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) only drank a wineglassful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) turned homewards, but reaching Petrovsky Ostrov he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road into the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) finished eating it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) walked away. His (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) legs felt suddenly heavy and a great drowsiness came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>). In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality.
<p/>At times monstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are so truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but so artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he (<font color='blue'><b>dreamer</b></font>) an artist like Pushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking state.
<p/>Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) was a child about seven years old, walking into the country with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) father on the evening of a holiday.
<p/>It was a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) remembered it; indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) recalled it far more vividly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) dream than he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) had done in memory.
<p/>The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not even a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark blur on the very edge of the horizon.
<p/>A few paces beyond the last market garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) a feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) walked by it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) father.
<p/>Raskolnikov had a fearful dream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) dreamt he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) childhood in the little town of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) birth. There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse, hideous hoarse singing and often fighting.
<p/>Drunken and horrible-looking figures were hanging about the tavern. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) used to cling close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) father, trembling all over when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) met them.
<p/>Near the tavern the road became a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was a winding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the right to the graveyard.
<p/>In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola where he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) used to go to mass two or three times a year with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) father and mother, when a service was held in memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had never seen.
<p/>On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in the shape of a cross.
<p/>Near his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) grandmother's grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) younger brother who had died at six months old.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) at all, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been told about his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) little brother, and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) visited the graveyard he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) used religiously and reverently to cross himself and to bow down and kiss the little grave.
<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) dreamt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was walking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) father's hand and looking with dread at the tavern.
<p/>A peculiar circumstance attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) attention: there seemed to be some kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts, all singing and all more or less drunk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned ikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near the entrance of the tavern stood a cart, but a strange cart.
<p/>It was one of those big carts usually drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy goods.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their long manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect mountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going with a load than without it.
<p/>But now, strange to say, in the shafts of such a cart he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants' nags which he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load of wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in a rut.
<p/>And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even about the nose and eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) felt so sorry, so sorry for them that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) almost cried, and his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) mother always used to take him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) away from the window.
<p/>All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing and the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken peasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over their shoulders.
<p/>'' Get in, get in! '' shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with a fleshy face red as a carrot.
<p/>'' I'll take you all, get in!'' But at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the crowd.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take us all with a beast like that!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get in, I'll take you all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mikolka</b></font>)</div>Mikolka shouted again, leaping first into the cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front.
<p/>The bay has gone with Matvey,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) shouted from the cart--<div class="bookquote">``and this brute, mates, is just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And this mare is twenty if she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) is a day, mates!'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)'s just eating her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) head off. Get in, I tell you!
<p/>I'll make her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) gallop! She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)'ll gallop!'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to flog the little mare.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get in! Come along!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The crowd laughed. '' D'you hear, she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)'ll gallop!'' <div class="bookquote">``Gallop indeed! She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) has not had a gallop in her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) for the last ten years!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)'ll jog along!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you mind her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>), mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' All right! Give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)!
<p/>'' They all clambered into Mikolka's cart, laughing and making jokes. Six men got in and there was still room for more.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded headdress and thick leather shoes; she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) was cracking nuts and laughing.
<p/>They hauled in a fat, rosy-cheeked woman. The crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help laughing?
<p/>That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a gallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to help Mikolka.
<p/>With the cry of <div class="bookquote">``now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mare</b></font>)</div>the mare tugged with all her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) might, but far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) struggled with her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which were showered upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) like hail.
<p/>The laughter in the cart and in the crowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed the mare, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) really could gallop.
<p/>'' Let me get in, too, mates,'' shouted a young man in the crowd whose appetite was aroused. <div class="bookquote">``Get in, all get in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mikolka</b></font>)</div>cried Mikolka, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) will draw you all.
<p/>I'll beat her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) to death! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mikolka</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself with fury. '' Father, father,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``father, what are they doing?
<p/>They are drunken and foolish, they are in fun; come away, don't look!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) tried to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) away, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) tore himself away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hand, and, beside himself with horror, ran to the horse.
<p/>Father, they are beating the poor horse!'' <div class="bookquote">``Come along, come along!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) father. '' The poor beast was in a bad way.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was gasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling. <div class="bookquote">``Beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to death,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mikolka</b></font>)</div>cried Mikolka, <div class="bookquote">``it's come to that.
<p/>I'll do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mikolka</b></font>)</div>'' What are you about, are you a Christian, you devil? '' shouted an old man in the crowd.
<p/>'' Did anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag like that pulling such a cartload,'' said another. '' You'll kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>),'' shouted the third.
<p/>'' Don't meddle! It's my property, I'll do what I choose. Get in, more of you! Get in, all of you!
<p/>All at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare, roused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking.
<p/>I will have her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) go at a gallop!... '' Even the old man could not help smiling. To think of a wretched little beast like that trying to kick!
<p/>Two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) about the ribs. One ran each side.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give us a song, mates,''  (<font color='red'><b>someone everyone</b></font>)</div>shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the cart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling.
<p/>'' Hit her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes,'' cried Mikolka. The woman went on cracking nuts and laughing. ...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) ran beside the mare, ran in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>), saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) being whipped across the eyes, right in the eyes!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) was crying, he (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) felt choking, his (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) tears were streaming. One of the men gave him (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) a cut with the whip across the face, he (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) did not feel it.
<p/>Wringing his (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) hands and screaming, he (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) rushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) head in disapproval.
<p/>One woman seized him (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) by the hand and would have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) away, but he (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) tore himself from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and ran back to the mare.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more. '' I'll teach you to kick,'' Mikolka shouted ferociously.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) threw down the whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long, thick shaft, he (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort brandished it over the mare.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)'ll crush her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>),'' was shouted round him (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>). '' He (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)'ll kill her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)!'' '' It's my property,'' shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a swinging blow.
<p/>There was a sound of a heavy thud. '' Thrash her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>), thrash her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)! Why have you stopped?'' shouted voices in the crowd.
<p/>And Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time on the spine of the luckless mare.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) sank back on her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) haunches, but lurched forward and tugged forward with all her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) force, tugged first on one side and then on the other, trying to move the cart.
<p/>But the six whips were attacking her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) in all directions, and the shaft was raised again and fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured blows.
<p/>Mikolka was in a fury that he (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) could not kill her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) at one blow. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)'s a tough one,'' was shouted in the crowd.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)'ll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>),'' said an admiring spectator in the crowd.
<p/>Stand off,'' Mikolka screamed frantically; he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) threw down the shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Fetch an axe to her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)! Finish her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) off,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>shouted a third. '' I'll show you! '' Look out,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) shouted, and with all his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) might he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) dealt a stunning blow at the poor mare.
<p/>The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull, but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) back
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) fell on the ground like a log. '' Finish her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) off,'' shouted Mikolka and he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) leapt beside himself, out of the cart.
<p/>Several young men, also flushed with drink, seized anything they could come across--whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dying mare.
<p/>Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the crowbar. The mare stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) head, drew a long breath and died.
<p/>'' You butchered her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>),'' someone shouted in the crowd. '' Why wouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) gallop then?'' '' My property!'' shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the bar in his (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) hands.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) stood as though regretting that he (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) had nothing more to beat. '' No mistake about it, you are not a Christian,'' many voices were shouting in the crowd.
<p/>But the poor boy, beside himself, made his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way, screaming, through the crowd to the sorrel nag, put his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) bleeding dead head and kissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips....
<p/>At that instant his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, who had been running after him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), snatched him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out of the crowd.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) jumped up and flew in a frenzy with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little fists out at Mikolka. '' Come along, come! Let us go home,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>'' Father! Why did they... kill... the poor horse! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sobbed, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) panting chest.
<p/>'' They are drunk.... They are brutal... it's not our business!'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) father
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) felt choked, choked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) tried to draw a breath, to cry out--and woke up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) waked up, gasping for breath, his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hair soaked with perspiration, and stood up in terror.
<p/>'' Thank God, that was only a dream,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, sitting down under a tree and drawing deep breaths. '' But what is it?
<p/>Is it some fever coming on? Such a hideous dream! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``can it be, can it be, that I shall really take an axe, that I shall strike her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) on the head, split her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) skull open... that I shall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble; hide,
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knees and leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Good God! all spattered in the blood... with the axe....
<p/>Good God, can it be? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was shaking like a leaf as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said this. '' But why am I going on like this?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) continued, sitting up again, as it were in profound amazement. '' I knew that I could never bring myself to it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now?
<p/>Yesterday, yesterday, when I went to make that... experiment , yesterday I realised completely that I could never bear to do it
<p/>.... Why am I going over it again, then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the stairs yesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile...
<p/>the very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror. '' No, I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it!
<p/>Granted, granted that there is no flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last month is clear as day, true as arithmetic....
<p/>My God! Anyway I couldn't bring myself to it! I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it! Why, why then am I still...?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at finding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was pale, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes glowed, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was exhausted in every limb, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) seemed suddenly to breathe more easily.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had cast off that fearful burden that had so long been weighing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and all at once there was a sense of relief and peace in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul.
<p/>Crossing the bridge, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky.
<p/>'' Lord,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) prayed, <div class="bookquote">``show me my path-- I renounce that accursed... dream of mine. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) weakness he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was not conscious of fatigue.
<p/>It was as though an abscess that had been forming for a month past in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) heart had suddenly broken. Freedom, freedom!
<p/>Later on, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) recalled that time and all that happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) during those days, minute by minute, point by point, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was superstitiously impressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very exceptional, always seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) afterwards the predestined turning-point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) fate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) could never understand and explain to himself why, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was tired and worn out, when it would have been more convenient for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to go home by the shortest and most direct way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had returned by the Hay Market where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had no need to go.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession! It was obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) way, though not much so.
<p/>It is true that it happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) dozens of times to return home without noticing what streets he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) passed through.
<p/>But why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was always asking himself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market -LRB-where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) had moreover no reason to go-RRB- at the very hour, the very minute of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) life when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive influence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) whole destiny?
<p/>As though it had been lying in wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) on purpose! It was about nine o'clock when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) crossed the Hay Market.
<p/>At the tables and the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their wares and, like their customers, were going home.
<p/>Rag pickers and costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market.
<p/>Raskolnikov particularly liked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wandered aimlessly in the streets. Here his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) rags did not attract contemptuous attention, and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people.
<p/>At the corner of an alley a huckster and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wife had two tables set out with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc..
<p/>They, too, had got up to go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just come up to them.
<p/>This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone called her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) watch and make his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) experiment ....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) already knew all about Lizaveta and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) a little too. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a single woman of about thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sister, who made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) work day and night, and even beat her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was standing with a bundle before the huckster and his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) wife, listening earnestly and doubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth.
<p/>The moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was overcome by a strange sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing astonishing about this meeting.
<p/>'' You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna,'' the huckster was saying aloud. <div class="bookquote">``Come round to-morrow about seven.
<p/>They will be here too. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lizaveta/Lizaveta Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind.
<p/>'' Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna,'' gabbled the huckster's wife, a lively little woman.
<p/>'' I look at you, you are like some little babe. And she (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) is not your own sister either--nothing but a step-sister and what a hand
<p/>But this time don't say a word to Alyona Ivanovna,'' her (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) husband interrupted; <div class="bookquote">``that's my advice, but come round to us without asking.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) keeps over you!''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>'' It will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have a notion.'' <div class="bookquote">``Am I to come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' About seven o'clock to-morrow. And they will be here. You will be able to decide for yourself.'' '' And we'll have a cup of tea,'' added his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife.
<p/>'' All right, I'll come,'' said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) began slowly moving away. Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) passed softly, unnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) first amazement was followed by a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) spine.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had learnt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at seven o'clock Lizaveta, the old woman's sister and only companion, would be away from home and that therefore at seven o'clock precisely the old woman would be left alone .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking; but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) felt suddenly in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) whole being that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had no more freedom of thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably decided.
<p/>Certainly, if he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan than that which had just presented itself.
<p/>In any case, it would have been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with greater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and investigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose life an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was only a few steps from his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) lodging. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) went in like a man condemned to death. CHAPTER VI Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wife had invited Lizaveta.
<p/>A family who had come to the town and been reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all women's things.
<p/>It was a very ordinary matter and there was nothing exceptional about it. As the things would have fetched little in the market, they were looking for a dealer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) undertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was very honest and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it.
<p/>This was Lizaveta's business. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spoke as a rule little and, as we have said already, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was very submissive and timid.
<p/>And in all this he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) was always afterwards disposed to see something strange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar influences and coincidences.
<p/>In the previous winter a student he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) knew called Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to give him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) might want to pawn anything.
<p/>But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of superstition remained in him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) long after, and were almost ineradicable. For a long while he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had lessons and managed to get along somehow.
<p/>Six weeks ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had remembered the address; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had two articles that could be pawned: his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) father's old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones, a present from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sister at parting.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) found the old woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at the first glance, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knew nothing special about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) decided to take the ring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) got two roubles from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and went into a miserable little tavern on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) way home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange idea was pecking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very much absorbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Almost beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) did not know and had never seen, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) a young officer.
<p/>They had played a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) heard the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and give him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) address.
<p/>This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had just come from her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and here at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) name.
<p/>Of course it was a chance, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not shake off a very extraordinary impression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); the student began telling his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) friend various details about Alyona Ivanovna.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is as rich as a Jew, she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) can give you five thousand roubles at a time and she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is not above taking a pledge for a rouble.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is first-rate,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) said. '' You can always get money from her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). Lots of our fellows have had dealings with her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) began describing how spiteful and uncertain she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was, how if you were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven percent a month on it and so on.
<p/>The student chattered on, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was continually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child, though Lizaveta was at least six feet high.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is an awful old harpy... '' '' There's a phenomenon for you,'' cried the student and he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) laughed. They began talking about Lizaveta.
<p/>The student spoke about her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with a peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened with great interest and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) to send Lizaveta to do some mending for him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).
<p/>Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) half-sister, being the child of a different mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) worked day and night for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister, and besides doing the cooking and the washing, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister all she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) earned.
<p/>The old woman had already made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not get a farthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was left to a monastery in the province of N--, that prayers might be said for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in perpetuity.
<p/>Lizaveta was of lower rank than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister, unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long feet that looked as if they were bent outwards.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was thirty-five. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind without her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister's permission. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) always wore battered goatskin shoes, and was clean in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) person.
<p/>What the student expressed most surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was continually with child. '' But you say she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is hideous?'' observed the officer.
<p/>Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but you know she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is not at all hideous.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has such a good-natured face and eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people are attracted by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up with anything, always willing, willing to do anything. And her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) smile is really very sweet.''
<p/>I could kill that damned old woman and make off with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) money, I assure you, without the faintest conscience-prick,'' the student added with warmth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) attractive yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>laughed the officer. '' From her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) queerness. No, I'll tell you what. The officer laughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered.
<p/>I was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid, senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply useless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is living for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case.
<p/>How strange it was! '' Listen, I want to ask you a serious question,'' the student said hotly. '' You understand?
<p/>You understand?'' '' Yes, yes, I understand,'' answered the officer, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) excited companion attentively. '' Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for want of help and by thousands, on every side!
<p/>A hundred thousand good deeds could be done and helped, on that old woman's money which will be buried in a monastery!
<p/>Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the right path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from vice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) money.
<p/>Kill her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all.
<p/>What do you think, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands would be saved from corruption and decay.
<p/>One death, and a hundred lives in exchange--it's simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life of that sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!
<p/>No more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact because the old woman is doing harm.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is wearing out the lives of others; the other day she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bit Lizaveta's finger out of spite; it almost had to be amputated.''
<p/>Oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, but for that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not deserve to live,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>remarked the officer, <div class="bookquote">``but there it is, it's nature.''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>'' But for that, there would never have been a single great man.
<p/>They talk of duty, conscience--I don't want to say anything against duty and conscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them?
<p/>Stay, I have another question to ask you. Listen!'' '' No, you stay, I'll ask you a question. Listen!'' <div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>You are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill the old woman yourself ?'' <div class="bookquote">``Of course not! I was only arguing the justice of it....
<p/>It's nothing to do with me...''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' But I think, if you would not do it yourself, there's no justice about it....
<p/>Of course, it was all ordinary youthful talk and thought, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had often heard before in different forms and on different themes.
<p/>But why had he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) happened to hear such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) own brain was just conceiving... the very same ideas ?
<p/>And why, just at the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had brought away the embryo of his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) idea from the old woman had he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) dropped at once upon a conversation about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?
<p/>This trivial talk in a tavern had an immense influence on him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) later action; as though there had really been in it something preordained, some guiding hint...
<p/>**** On returning from the Hay Market he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) flung himself on the sofa and sat for a whole hour without stirring.
<p/>Let us have another game. '' Raskolnikov was violently agitated. This coincidence always seemed strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). * Meanwhile it got dark; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had no candle and, indeed, it did not occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to light up.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) former fever and shivering, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) realised with relief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could lie down on the sofa.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could never recollect whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been thinking about anything at that time. Soon heavy, leaden sleep came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), as it were crushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya, coming into his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) room at ten o'clock the next morning, had difficulty in rousing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nastasya</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in tea and bread. The tea was again the second brew and again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nastasya</b></font>) own tea-pot. ''
<p/>My goodness, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sleeps! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Nastasya</b></font>) cried indignantly. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is always asleep. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) got up with an effort.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head ached, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood up, took a turn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) garret and sank back on the sofa again. '' Going to sleep again,'' cried Nastasya.
<p/>'' Are you ill, eh?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) made no reply. '' Do you want some tea?'' <div class="bookquote">``Afterwards,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said with an effort, closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes again and turning to the wall.
<p/>Nastasya stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) really is ill,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said, turned and went out. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came in again at two o'clock with soup.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was lying as before. The tea stood untouched. Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully rousing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' Why are you lying like a log?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) shouted, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with repulsion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.
<p/>'' Are you ill or not? '' asked Nastasya and again received no answer. '' You'd better go out and get a breath of air,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said after a pause.
<p/>'' Will you eat it or not?'' <div class="bookquote">``Afterwards,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said weakly. '' You can go. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) motioned her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) remained a little longer, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with compassion and went out. A few minutes afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes and looked for a long while at the tea and the soup.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) took the bread, took up a spoon and began to eat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were mechanically.
<p/>After his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) meal he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stretched himself on the sofa again, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not sleep; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lay without stirring, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face in the pillow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was haunted by day-dreams and such strange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was in Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis.
<p/>The caravan was resting, the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a complete circle; all the party were at dinner.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head ached less. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was drinking water from a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool
<p/>, it was wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like gold....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) started, roused himself, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was, suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) off the sofa.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heard a clock strike. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began listening on the staircase.
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) strange and monstrous that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could have slept in such forgetfulness from the previous day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet....
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart beat terribly. But all was quiet on the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... And meanwhile perhaps it had struck six.
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) drowsiness and stupefaction were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted haste. But the preparations to be made were few.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) concentrated all his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart kept beating and thumping so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could hardly breathe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) rummaged under his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away under it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt.
<p/>First he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had to make a noose and sew it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) overcoat--a work of a moment. From its rags he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tore a long strip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) folded this strip in two, took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wide, strong summer overcoat of some stout cotton material -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) only outer garment-RRB- and began sewing the two ends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands shook as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sewed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did it successfully so that nothing showed outside when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) put the coat on again.
<p/>The needle and thread he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had got ready long before and they lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) table in a piece of paper.
<p/>As for the noose, it was a very ingenious device of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own; the noose was intended for the axe. It was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to carry the axe through the street in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands.
<p/>And if hidden under his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) coat he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would still have had to support it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand, which would have been noticeable.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang quietly under his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) arm on the inside.
<p/>Putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) coat pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it could not be seen from outside that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was holding something with the hand that was in the pocket.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had finished with this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand into a little opening between his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out the pledge , which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had got ready long before and hidden there.
<p/>This noose, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had designed a fortnight before. This pledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and thickness of a silver cigarette case.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) picked up this piece of wood in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of a workshop.
<p/>Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had added to the wood a thin smooth piece of iron, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had also picked up at the same time in the street.
<p/>Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it.
<p/>This was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment.
<p/>The iron strip was added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first minute that the <div class="bookquote">``thing''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>was made of wood.
<p/>All this had been stored by him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beforehand under the sofa. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had only just got the pledge out when he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard someone suddenly about in the yard.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rushed to the door, listened, caught up his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hat and began to descend his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat.
<p/>'' It struck six long ago. '' <div class="bookquote">``Long ago! My God!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had still the most important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had also a pocket pruning-knife, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not rely on the knife and still less on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe.
<p/>We may note in passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final they were,
<p/>That the deed must be done with an axe he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had decided long ago. the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>In spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) agonising inward struggle, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) never for a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) plans.
<p/>And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point could have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of any kind had remained, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would, it seems, have renounced it all as something absurd, monstrous and impossible.
<p/>But a whole mass of unsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe, that trifling business cost him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.
<p/>Nastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings; she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the door ajar.
<p/>And so, when the time came, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would only have to go quietly into the kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later -LRB-when everything was over-RRB- go in and put it back again.
<p/>It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) about. But these were doubtful points. Supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had come back and was on the spot.
<p/>But supposing she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) were in the meantime to miss the axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at least grounds for suspicion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would of course have to go by and wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) went out again. But those were all trifles which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not even begun to consider, and indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had no time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was thinking of the chief point, and put off trifling details, until he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could believe in it all . But that seemed utterly unattainable.
<p/>So it seemed to himself at least. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not imagine, for instance, that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would sometime leave off thinking, get up and simply go there....
<p/>Even his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) late experiment -LRB-i.e. his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) visit with the object of a final survey of the place-RRB- was simply an attempt at an experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say <div class="bookquote">``come, let us go and try it--why dream about it!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and at once he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.
<p/>Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) analysis was complete; his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not find rational objections in himself.
<p/>But in the last resort he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought arguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were forcing and drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to it.
<p/>At first--long before indeed--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been much occupied with one question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily detected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself.
<p/>Almost every criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence and caution are most essential.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease, developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the individual case, and then passed off like any other disease.
<p/>The question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of the nature of disease, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not yet feel able to decide.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached these conclusions, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) decided that in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own case there could not be such a morbid reaction, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reason and will would remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) design, for the simple reason that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) design was <div class="bookquote">``not a crime....
<p/>We will omit all the process by means of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrived at this last conclusion; we have run too far ahead already...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We may add only that the practical, purely material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind.
<p/>One has but to keep all one's will-power and reason to deal with them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business....
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) final decisions were what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.
<p/>'' '' But this preparation had never been begun. One trifling circumstance upset his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) calculations, before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had even left the staircase.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached the landlady's kitchen, the door of which was open as usual, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glanced cautiously in to see whether, in Nastasya's absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether the door to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) own room was closed, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) might not peep out when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went in for the axe.
<p/>But what was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) amazement when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suddenly saw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line.
<p/>Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) left off hanging the clothes, turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was passing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, and walked past as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not the axe!
<p/>What made me think,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reflected, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went under the gateway, <div class="bookquote">``what made me think that she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) would be sure not to be at home at that moment!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was overwhelmed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Why, why, why did I assume this so certainly? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was crushed and even humiliated. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have laughed at himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anger....
<p/>To go into the street, to go a walk for appearance' sake was revolting; to go back to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room, even more revolting.
<p/>A dull animal rage boiled within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood hesitating in the gateway. '' And what a chance I have lost for ever!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered, standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter's little dark room, which was also open. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started.
<p/>From the porter's room, two paces away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), something shining under the bench to the right caught his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye.... He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--nobody.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) approached the room on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called the porter. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) dashed to the axe -LRB-it was an axe-RRB- and pulled it out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood; at once, before going out, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) made it fast in the noose, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) thrust both hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>)!
<p/>Yes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for the door is wide open. '' '' When reason fails, the devil helps!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) thought with a strange grin. This chance raised his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) spirits extraordinarily. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening suspicion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking at their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hat. '' Good heavens! I had the money the day before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!
<p/>Glancing out of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) eye into a shop, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) saw by a clock on the wall that it was ten minutes past seven.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had to make haste and at the same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the other side...
<p/>'' A curse rose from the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) soul. When he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had sometimes thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) would be very much afraid.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was not very much afraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) mind was even occupied by irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) passed the Yusupov garden, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all the squares.
<p/>By degrees he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) passed to the conviction that if the summer garden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the garden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a great benefit to the town.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was interested by the question why in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all sorts of nastiness.
<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) own walks through the Hay Market came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) mind, and for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) waked up to reality.
<p/>So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that meets them on the way,'' flashed through his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) mind, but simply flashed, like lightning; he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) made haste to dismiss this thought...
<p/>'' What nonsense! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``better think of nothing at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And by now he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was near; here was the house, here was the gate.
<p/>Suddenly a clock somewhere struck once. '' What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it must be fast!'' Luckily for him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), everything went well again at the gates.
<p/>At that very moment, as though expressly for his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) benefit, a huge waggon of hay had just driven in at the gate, completely screening him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) passed under the gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into the yard, before he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had slipped in a flash to the right.
<p/>On the other side of the waggon he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) and no one met him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>).
<p/>Many windows looking into that huge quadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) did not raise his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) head--he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had not the strength to.
<p/>The staircase leading to the old woman's room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was already on the stairs....
<p/>Drawing a breath, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hand against his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) throbbing heart, and once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) began softly and cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute.
<p/>One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were at work in it, but they did not glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>).
<p/>But the stairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) met no one. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) stood still, thought a minute and went on.
<p/>'' Of course it would be better if they had not been here, but... it's two storeys above them. '' And there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the flat opposite, the empty one.
<p/>The flat underneath the old woman's was apparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been torn off--they had gone away!...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was out of breath. For one instant the thought floated through his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) mind <div class="bookquote">``Shall I go back? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) made no answer and began listening at the old woman's door, a dead silence.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently... then looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) for the last time, pulled himself together, drew himself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose.
<p/>'' Am I very pale? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) wondered. '' Am I not evidently agitated? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is mistrustful.... Had I better wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?
<p/>'' But his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spite him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), it throbbed more and more violently.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) could stand it no longer, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) slowly put out his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) rang again, more loudly.
<p/>No answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman was, of course, at home, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was suspicious and alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had some knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) habits... and once more he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) ear to the door. Either his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) senses were peculiarly keen -LRB-which it is difficult to suppose-RRB-, or the sound was really very distinct.
<p/>Anyway, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) suddenly heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the rustle of a skirt at the very door.
<p/>Someone was standing stealthily close to the lock and just as he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was doing on the outside was secretly listening within, and seemed to have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ear to the door....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) moved a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) might not have the appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly, and without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) could not make out how he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had had such cunning, for his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) mind was as it were clouded at moments
<p/>The door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and suspicious eyes stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) out of the darkness.
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was almost unconscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) body.... An instant later he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) heard the latch unfastened. CHAPTER VII Then Raskolnikov lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head and nearly made a great mistake.
<p/>Fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not hoping that the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would disarm her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suspicions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) took hold of the door and drew it towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to prevent the old woman from attempting to shut it again.
<p/>Seeing this she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not pull the door back, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not let go the handle so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) almost dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out with it on to the stairs.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stepped back in alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared with open eyes at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began, trying to speak easily, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) voice would not obey him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), it broke and shook.
<p/>Seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was standing in the doorway not allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to pass, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) advanced straight upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). '' '' I have come...
<p/>I have brought something... but we'd better come in... to the light... '' And leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) passed straight into the room uninvited.
<p/>The old woman ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tongue was unloosed. '' Good heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you want?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me... Raskolnikov... here, I brought you the pledge I promised the other day... ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) held out the pledge.
<p/>The old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in the eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uninvited visitor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked intently, maliciously and mistrustfully. A minute passed; he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) even fancied something like a sneer in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had already guessed everything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was losing his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) head, that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was almost frightened, so frightened that if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were to look like that and not say a word for another half minute, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) would have run away from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>'' Why do you look at me as though you did not know me? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) said suddenly, also with malice.
<p/>'' Take it if you like, if not I'll go elsewhere, I am in a hurry. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of itself.
<p/>The old woman recovered herself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) visitor's resolute tone evidently restored her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) confidence. '' But why, my good sir, all of a minute....
<p/>What is it? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked, looking at the pledge. '' The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand. '' But how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?
<p/>Have you been bathing, or what?'' <div class="bookquote">``Fever,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) answered abruptly. '' You can't help getting pale... if you've nothing to eat,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) added, with difficulty articulating the words.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) strength was failing him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) again. But his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) answer sounded like the truth; the old woman took the pledge. '' What is it?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and weighing the pledge in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand. '' A thing... cigarette case.... Silver....
<p/>Trying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light -LRB-all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) altogether for some seconds and stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) unbuttoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet take it out altogether, simply holding it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) right hand under the coat.
<p/>Look at it. '' <div class="bookquote">``It does not seem somehow like silver.... How he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) has wrapped it up!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) hands were fearfully weak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) felt them every moment growing more numb and more wooden.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) would let the axe slip and fall.... A sudden giddiness came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>). '' But what has he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) tied it up like this for?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) pulled the axe quite out, swung it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' the old woman cried with vexation and moved towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) had not a minute more to lose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) seemed not to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) own strength in this.
<p/>But as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) had once brought the axe down, his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) strength returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>). The old woman was as always bareheaded.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thin, light hair, streaked with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat's tail and fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neck.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the floor, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) skull. In one hand she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still held <div class="bookquote">``the pledge.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dealt her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) another and another blow with the blunt side and on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the body fell back.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets, the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket -LRB-trying to avoid the streaming body-RRB---the same right-hand pocket from which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had taken the key on his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) last visit.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was in full possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands were still trembling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remembered afterwards that he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been particularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get smeared with blood....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pulled out the keys at once, they were all, as before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ran at once into the bedroom with them.
<p/>It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images. Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with a silk patchwork wadded quilt.
<p/>Strange to say, so soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to fit the keys into the chest, so soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed over him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Against a third wall was a chest of drawers. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go away.
<p/>But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea occurred to his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Leaving the keys in the chest, he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more over the old woman, but did not bring it down.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suddenly fancied that the old woman might be still alive and might recover her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) senses. There was no doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dead.
<p/>Bending down and examining her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again more closely, he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was about to feel it with his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finger, but drew back his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand and indeed it was evident without that.
<p/>All at once he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) noticed a string on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neck; he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tugged at it, but the string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked with blood.
<p/>Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of blood. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but something held it and prevented its coming.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) impatience he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raised the axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not dare, and with difficulty, smearing his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand and the axe in the blood, after two minutes' hurried effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cut the string and took it off without touching the body with the axe
<p/>On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of copper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring.
<p/>The purse was stuffed very full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pocket without looking at it, flung the crosses on the old woman's body and rushed back into the bedroom, this time taking the axe with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was not mistaken--it was a purse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was in terrible haste, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) snatched the keys, and began trying them again.
<p/>It was not so much that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands were shaking, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) kept making mistakes; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw for instance that a key was not the right one and would not fit, still he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tried to put it in.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered and realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of drawers -LRB-on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) last visit this had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)-RRB-, but to some strong box, and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) left the chest of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old women usually keep boxes under their beds.
<p/>; there was a good-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. And so it was The notched key fitted at once and unlocked it.
<p/>At the top, under a white sheet, was a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress, then a shawl
<p/>and it seemed as though there was nothing below but clothes. The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did was to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) blood-stained hands on the red brocade.
<p/>It's red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,'' the thought passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suddenly came to himself.
<p/>'' '' Good God, am I going out of my senses? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought with terror. But no sooner did he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from under the fur coat.
<p/>There turned out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably all pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains, ear-rings, pins and such things.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made haste to turn them all over. Some were in cases, others simply wrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with tape.
<p/>Without any delay, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began filling up the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) trousers and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not time to take many....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stopped short and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fancy.
<p/>All at once he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heard distinctly a faint cry, as though someone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for a minute or two.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sat squatting on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heels by the box and waited holding his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) breath. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of the bedroom.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was gazing in stupefaction at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murdered sister, white as a sheet and seeming not to have the strength to cry out.
<p/>Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) run out of the bedroom, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a shudder ran down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, opened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth, but still did not scream.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began slowly backing away from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) into the corner, staring intently, persistently at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), but still uttered no sound, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not get breath to scream.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rushed at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with the axe; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies' mouths, when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them and are on the point of screaming.
<p/>And this hapless Lizaveta was so simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not even raise a hand to guard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, though that was the most necessary and natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only put up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) empty left hand, but not to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, slowly holding it out before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as though motioning him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) away.
<p/>The axe fell with the sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the head.
<p/>In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head, snatching up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.
<p/>Fear gained more and more mastery over him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), especially after this second, quite unexpected murder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) longed to run away from the place as fast as possible.
<p/>And if at that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been capable of seeing and reasoning more correctly, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been able to realise all the difficulties of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the absurdity of it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could have understood how many obstacles and, perhaps, crimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of that place and to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) way home, it is very possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would have flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and not from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had done.
<p/>The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and grew stronger every minute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would not now have gone to the box or even into the room for anything in the world.
<p/>But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); at moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) forgot himself, or rather, forgot what was of importance, and caught at trifles.
<p/>Glancing, however, into the kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) bethought him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) of washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands and the axe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap that lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands in the bucket.
<p/>When they were clean, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) took out the axe, washed the blade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands were sticky with blood. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wiped it all with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen
<p/>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window. There was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp.
<p/>Then as far as was possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) overcoat, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) trousers and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) boots.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) carefully hung the axe in the noose under his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) coat. At the first glance there seemed to be nothing but stains on the boots.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wetted the rag and rubbed the boots. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something quite noticeable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was overlooking.
<p/>Dark agonising ideas rose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind--the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was mad and that at that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was incapable of reasoning, of protecting himself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) ought perhaps to be doing something utterly different from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was now doing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood in the middle of the room, lost in thought. '' Good God! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) muttered <div class="bookquote">``I must fly, fly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rushed into the entry.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stood and gazed and could not believe his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes: the door, the outer door from the stairs, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not long before waited and rung, was standing unfastened and at least six inches open.
<p/>But here a shock of terror awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) such as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had never known before. No lock, no bolt, all the time, all that time!
<p/>The old woman had not shut it after him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) perhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had seen Lizaveta afterwards!
<p/>And how could he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), how could he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) have failed to reflect that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must have come in somehow! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not have come through the wall!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dashed to the door and fastened the latch. '' But no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away...''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the staircase. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway, two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.
<p/>'' What are they about? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) waited patiently. At last all was still, as though suddenly cut off; they had separated.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was meaning to go out, but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone began going downstairs humming a tune.
<p/>'' How is it they all make such a noise? '' flashed through his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind. Once more he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) closed the door and waited.
<p/>At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was just taking a step towards the stairs when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heard fresh footsteps.
<p/>The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming there , to the fourth floor, to the old woman.
<p/>Why? Were the sounds somehow peculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had passed the first floor, now he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was mounting higher, it was growing more and more distinct!
<p/>And it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) all at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was turned to stone, that it was like a dream in which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is rooted to the spot and cannot even move one's arms.
<p/>At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) suddenly started, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the flat and closing the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heavy breathing. And now the third storey had been reached. Coming here! Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) took the hook and softly, noiselessly, fixed it in the catch.
<p/>Instinct helped him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had done this, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) crouched holding his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) breath, by the door. The unknown visitor was by now also at the door.
<p/>They were now standing opposite one another, as he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had just before been standing with the old woman, when the door divided them and he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was listening.
<p/>The visitor panted several times. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) must be a big, fat man,'' thought Raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand.
<p/>It seemed like a dream indeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly. As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of something moving in the room.
<p/>For some seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) listened quite seriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently and impatiently at the handle of the door.
<p/>Raskolnikov gazed in horror at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every minute that the fastening would be pulled out.
<p/>It certainly did seem possible, so violently was he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shaking it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was tempted to hold the fastening, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) might be aware of it.
<p/>A giddiness came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) again. '' I shall fall down!'' flashed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind, but the unknown began to speak and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) recovered himself at once.
<p/>'' What's up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) bawled in a thick voice, <div class="bookquote">``Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch!
<p/>Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey, my beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And again, enraged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tugged with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) might a dozen times at the bell.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate acquaintance. At this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the stairs.
<p/>You don't say there's no one at home,'' the new-comer cried in a cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on pulling the bell.
<p/>Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at first. '' '' Good evening, Koch.'' <div class="bookquote">``From his (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) must be quite young,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>thought Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' Who the devil can tell? I've almost broken the lock,'' answered Koch. '' But how do you come to know me?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at billiards at Gambrinus'. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' So they are not at home?
<p/>That's queer. It's awfully stupid though. Where could the old woman have gone? I've come on business. '' '' Yes; and I have business with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), too.
<p/>'' '' Well, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping to get some money! '' cried the young man.
<p/>'' We must give it up, of course, but what did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fix this time for? The old witch fixed the time for me to come herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) sits here from year's end to year's end, the old hag; her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) legs are bad and yet here all of a sudden she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) is out for a walk!''
<p/>It's out of my way. And where the devil she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) can have got to, I can't make out. <div class="bookquote">``Hadn't we better ask the porter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)'s gone and when she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)'ll be back.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hm</b></font>)</div>'' Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) never does go anywhere.
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) once more tugged at the door-handle. '' Damn it all. There's nothing to be done, we must go!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the young man suddenly. '' Do you see how the door shakes if you pull it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>That shows it's not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how the hook clanks?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, don't you see?
<p/>If they were all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the key and not with the hook from inside.
<p/>That proves that one of them is at home. There, do you hear how the hook is clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home, don't you see.
<p/>So there they are sitting inside and don't open the door!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well! And so they must be! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Koch</b></font>)</div>cried Koch, astonished.
<p/>'' What are they about in there? '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) began furiously shaking the door. <div class="bookquote">``Stay! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the young man again.
<p/>'' Don't pull at it! There must be something wrong.... Here, you've been ringing and pulling at the door and still they don't open!
<p/>So either they've both fainted or... '' <div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what. Let's go fetch the porter, let him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) wake them up.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' All right. '' Both were going down. '' Stay. You stop here while I run down for the porter.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, you'd better. '' '' All right.'' '' I'm studying the law you see! It's evident, e-vi-dent there's something wrong here!''
<p/>Once more he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) softly touched the bell which gave one tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>), began touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once more that it was only fastened by the hook.
<p/>Then puffing and panting he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) bent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock on the inside
<p/>the young man cried hotly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran downstairs. Koch remained. and so nothing could be seen. Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe.
<p/>While they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to end it all at once and shout to them through the door.
<p/>Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them, while they could not open the door! ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was in a sort of delirium. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was even making ready to fight when they should come in. Only make haste!'' was the thought that flashed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind.
<p/>'' But what the devil is he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) about?... '' Time was passing, one minute, and another--no one came. Koch began to be restless.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) sentry duty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>), too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) heavy boots on the stairs.
<p/>'' What the devil? The steps died away. '' Good heavens! What am I to do? '' Raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.
<p/>Abruptly, without any thought at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went out, closing the door as thoroughly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could, and went downstairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had gone down three flights when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suddenly heard a loud voice below--where could he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) go!
<p/>Somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran down the stairs, bawling at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) voice.
<p/>There was nowhere to hide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was just going back to the flat. '' Hey there! Catch the brute! '' <div class="bookquote">``Mitka!
<p/>Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was still.
<p/>But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began noisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) distinguished the ringing voice of the young man. '' Hey!'' Filled with despair he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went straight to meet them, feeling <div class="bookquote">``come what must!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If they stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)--all was lost; if they let him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pass--all was lost too; they would remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). They were approaching; they were only a flight from him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)--and suddenly deliverance!
<p/>A few steps from him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) on the right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though for his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) benefit, they had just left.
<p/>The floor had only just been painted, in the middle of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes.
<p/>In one instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.
<p/>It was they, no doubt, who had just run down, shouting. Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) waited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs. No one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the flat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as the door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the bodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and completely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had succeeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) passed quickly through the gateway and turned to the left in the street. They would guess most likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had been in the empty flat, while they were going upstairs.
<p/>And meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) dared not quicken his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) pace much, though the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. ''
<p/>Should he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No, hopeless! Should he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) fling away the axe?
<p/>Should he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) take a cab? Hopeless, hopeless! '' At last he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) reached the turning. He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) turned down it more dead than alive.
<p/>; it was less risky because there was a great crowd of people, and he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was lost in it like a grain of sand.
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was half way to safety, and he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) understood it But all he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had suffered had so weakened him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) could scarcely move.
<p/>Perspiration ran down him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) in drops, his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) neck was all wet. '' My word, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) has been going it!'' someone shouted at him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) came out on the canal bank.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal bank, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more conspicuous, and he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had thought of turning back.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was almost falling from fatigue, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) went a long way round so as to get home from quite a different direction.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) went the worse it was. He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was not fully conscious when he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) passed through the gateway of his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) house!
<p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had a very grave problem before him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>), to put it back and to escape observation as far as possible in doing so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was of course incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody's yard.
<p/>But it all happened fortunately, the door of the porter's room was closed but not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was already on the staircase before he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) recollected the axe. But he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had so completely lost all power of reflection that he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) walked straight to the door and opened it.
<p/>But again the porter was not at home, and he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) succeeded in putting the axe back under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as before.
<p/>If the porter had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``What do you want? ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) would perhaps have simply handed him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) the axe. He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) room; the landlady's door was shut.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) room, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) flung himself on the sofa just as he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was--he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) did not sleep, but sank into blank forgetfulness.
<p/>Scraps and shreds of thoughts were simply swarming in his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) brain, but he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) could not catch at one, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) could not rest on one, in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) efforts....
<p/>If anyone had come into his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) room then, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) would have jumped up at once and screamed. PART II CHAPTER I
<p/>Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) seemed to wake up, and at such moments he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) noticed that it was far into the night, but it did not occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) to get up.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) lay a very long while. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) noticed that it was beginning to get light. He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) back, still dazed from his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) recent oblivion.
<p/>Fearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) heard every night, indeed, under his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) window after two o'clock.
<p/>Ah! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``it's past two o'clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and at once he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) leaped up, as though someone had pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) from the sofa.
<p/>They woke him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) up now. '' <div class="bookquote">``What! Past two o'clock! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) sat down on the sofa--and instantly recollected everything! All at once, in one flash, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) recollected everything.
<p/>A dreadful chill came over him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>); but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) sleep.
<p/>For the first moment he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was going mad. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) teeth chattered and all his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) limbs were shaking.
<p/>With amazement he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) gazed at himself and everything in the room around him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>), wondering how he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) could have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have flung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) hat off.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) opened the door and began listening--everything in the house was asleep. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) pillow.
<p/>'' If anyone had come in, what would he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) have thought? That I'm drunk but... '' He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) rushed to the window.
<p/>There was light enough, and he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) began hurriedly looking himself all over from head to foot, all his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) clothes; were there no traces?
<p/>But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) began taking off everything and looking over again. He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) turned everything over to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) search three times.
<p/>But there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) trousers.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) remembered that the purse and the things he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had taken out of the old woman's box were still in his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) pockets!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed threads. There seemed to be nothing more. He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had not thought till then of taking them out and hiding them!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had not even thought of them while he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was examining his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) clothes! What next? Instantly he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) rushed to take them out and fling them on the table.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had pulled out everything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was nothing left, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) carried the whole heap to the corner.
<p/>The paper had come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) began stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: <div class="bookquote">``They're in!
<p/>All out of sight, and the purse too! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) thought gleefully, getting up and gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) shuddered all over with horror; <div class="bookquote">``My God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) whispered in despair: <div class="bookquote">``what's the matter with me? Is that hidden?
<p/>Is that the way to hide things?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had only thought of money, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.
<p/>'' But now, now, what am I glad of? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``Is that hiding things? My reason's deserting me--simply!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another unbearable fit of shivering.
<p/>Mechanically he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) drew from a chair beside him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) old student's winter coat, which was still warm though almost in rags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and delirium.
<p/>Not more than five minutes had passed when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) jumped up a second time, and at once pounced in a frenzy on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) clothes again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lost consciousness. '' How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have not taken the loop off the armhole!
<p/>I forgot it, forgot a thing like that! Such a piece of evidence! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits among his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) linen under the pillow.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) repeated, standing in the middle of the room, and with painful concentration he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fell to gazing about him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not forgotten anything.
<p/>The conviction that all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) faculties, even memory, and the simplest power of reflection were failing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), began to be an insufferable torture.
<p/>'' Pieces of torn linen couldn't rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I think not, I think not, any way! '' '' Surely it isn't beginning already!
<p/>The frayed rags he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had cut off his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) trousers were actually lying on the floor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them! ''
<p/>Surely it isn't my punishment coming upon me? It is!'' What is the matter with me! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried again, like one distraught.
<p/>Then a strange idea entered his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head; that, perhaps, all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) clothes were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many stains, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not see them, did not notice them because his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) perceptions were failing, were going to pieces...
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) reason was clouded.... Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) remembered that there had been blood on the purse too. '' Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put the wet purse in my pocket!''
<p/>In a flash he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!
<p/>So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and memory, since I guessed it of myself,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought triumphantly, with a deep sigh of relief; <div class="bookquote">``it's simply the weakness of fever, a moment's delirium,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) trousers.
<p/>At that instant the sunlight fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) left boot; on the sock which poked out from the boot, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fancied there were traces!
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) flung off his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) boots; <div class="bookquote">``traces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with blood;''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) must have unwarily stepped into that pool...
<p/>'' But what am I to do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gathered them all up in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands and stood in the middle of the room. '' In the stove?
<p/>But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them? But what can I burn them with? There are no matches even.
<p/>No, better go out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes, better throw it away,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) repeated, sitting down on the sofa again, <div class="bookquote">``and at once, this minute, without lingering...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy shivering came over him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); again he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) coat over him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>And for a long while, for some hours, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was haunted by the impulse to <div class="bookquote">``go off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that it may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Several times he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tried to rise from the sofa, but could not. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) door.
<p/>'' Open, do, are you dead or alive? He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) keeps sleeping here!'' shouted Nastasya, banging with her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fist on the door.
<p/>'' For whole days together he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s snoring here like a dog! A dog he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is too. Open I tell you. It's past ten.''
<p/>'' Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s not at home,'' said a man's voice. '' Ha! that's the porter's voice.... What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) want? ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) heart was a positive pain. '' Then who can have latched the door?
<p/>'' retorted Nastasya. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>)'s taken to bolting himself in! As if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) were worth stealing! Open, you stupid, wake up!''
<p/>'' What do they want? Why the porter? All's discovered. Resist or open? Come what may!... '' He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) room was so small that he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) could undo the latch without leaving the bed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) glanced with a defiant and desperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded paper sealed with bottle-wax.
<p/>Nastasya stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) in a strange way. '' A notice from the office,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) announced, as he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) the paper.
<p/>'' From what office? '' <div class="bookquote">``A summons to the police office, of course. You know which office.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To the police? ...
<p/>What for?... ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How can I tell? You're sent for, so you go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attentively, looked round the room and turned to go away.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s downright ill! '' observed Nastasya, not taking her (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The porter turned his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) head for a moment.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>)'s been in a fever since yesterday,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) added. Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands, without opening it.
<p/>'' Don't you get up then,'' Nastasya went on compassionately, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) feet down from the sofa.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked; in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) right hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) held the shreds he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had cut from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket.
<p/>'' You're ill, and so don't go ; there's no such hurry. What have you got there?'' So he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been asleep with them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Afterwards reflecting upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered that half waking up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fever, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had grasped all this tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand and so fallen asleep again.
<p/>'' Look at the rags he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'s collected and sleeps with them, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) has got hold of a treasure...'' And Nastasya went off into her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hysterical giggle.
<p/>Far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was from being capable of rational reflection at that moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt that no one would behave like that with a person who was going to be arrested.
<p/>Instantly he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thrust them all under his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) great coat and fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes intently upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' But... the police?'' ''
<p/>You'd better have some tea! Yes? I'll bring it , there's some left.'' '' No... I'm going; I'll go at once,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) muttered, getting on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) feet.
<p/>'' Why, you'll never get downstairs!'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'll go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' As you please. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) followed the porter out. At once he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.
<p/>'' There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt, and rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could distinguish anything.
<p/>Then with a tremor he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) broke the seal of the notice and began reading; he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was a long while reading, before he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) understood.
<p/>It was an ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at half-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.
<p/>Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed, thank God!'' '' But when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with the police!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was flinging himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knees to pray, but broke into laughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.
<p/>And why just to-day?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought in agonising bewilderment. '' Good God, only get it over soon! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began, hurriedly dressing.
<p/>'' If I'm lost, I am lost, I don't care! Shall I put the sock on? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) suddenly wondered, <div class="bookquote">``it will get dustier still and the traces will be gone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pulled it off, but reflecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had no other socks, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) picked it up and put it on again--and again he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) laughed.
<p/>That's all conventional, that's all relative, merely a way of looking at it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind, while he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was shuddering all over, <div class="bookquote">``there, I've got it on!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) put it on than he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pulled it off again in loathing and horror. '' I have finished by getting it on!''
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) laughter was quickly followed by despair. '' No, it's too much for me... '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) legs shook.
<p/>They want to decoy me there and confound me over everything,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mused, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went out on to the stairs--<div class="bookquote">``the worst of it
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>From fear,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) muttered. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head swam and ached with fever. '' It's a trick! is I'm almost light-headed... I may blurt out something stupid...
<p/>On the stairs he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was leaving all the things just as they were in the hole in the wall, <div class="bookquote">``and very likely, it's on purpose to search when I'm out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought, and stopped short.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was possessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call it, that with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went on.
<p/>'' '' Only to get it over!'' In the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had fallen all those days.
<p/>Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench from the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish pedlars and half-broken-down cabs.
<p/>The sun shone straight in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes, so that it hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to look out of them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head going round--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) comes out into the street on a bright sunny day.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) reached the turning into the street, in an agony of trepidation he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked down it... at the house... and at once averted his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' If they question me, perhaps I'll simply tell,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) drew near the police-station. The police-station was about a quarter of a mile off.
<p/>It had lately been moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been once for a moment in the old office but long ago.
<p/>Turning in at the gateway, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with a book in his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is here,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) began ascending the stairs on the chance. He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) did not want to ask questions of anyone.
<p/>'' I'll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything... '' he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) reached the fourth floor. The staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water.
<p/>The kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost the whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat.
<p/>The staircase was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their arms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes.
<p/>There, too, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.
<p/>The door of the office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. After waiting a little, he (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) decided to move forward into the next room.
<p/>All the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) on and on. No one paid attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>).
<p/>In the second room some clerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) was, and rather a queer-looking set. He (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) went up to one of them.
<p/>'' What is it? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) showed the notice he (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) had received. '' You are a student? '' the man asked, glancing at the notice.
<p/>'' Yes, formerly a student. '' The clerk looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>), but without the slightest interest. He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was a particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) eye.
<p/>'' There would be no getting anything out of him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) has no interest in anything,'' thought Raskolnikov. '' Go in there to the head clerk,'' said the clerk, pointing towards the furthest room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and packed full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.
<p/>Among them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the table opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) dictation.
<p/>The other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face, excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosom as big as a saucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.
<p/>Raskolnikov thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced at it, said: <div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>and went on attending to the lady in mourning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) breathed more freely. '' It can't be that!'' By degrees he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began to regain confidence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) kept urging himself to have courage and be calm.
<p/>'' Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself! Hm... it's a pity there's no air here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``it's stifling....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was afraid of losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) self-control; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tried to catch at something and fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind on it, something quite irrelevant, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not succeed in this at all.
<p/>It makes one's head dizzier than ever... and one's mind too... ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. Yet the head clerk greatly interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) kept hoping to see through him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and guess something from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile face that looked older than his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) years.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was fashionably dressed and foppish, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded, and wore a number of rings on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) waistcoat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who was in the room, and said them fairly correctly.
<p/>Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said casually to the gaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not venturing to sit down, though there was a chair beside her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room.
<p/>'' '' Ich danke,'' said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sank into the chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smelt of scent.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was obviously embarrassed at filling half the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smile was impudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.
<p/>All at once, with some noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) shoulders at each step.
<p/>The lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) cockaded cap on the table and sat down in an easy-chair.
<p/>The small lady positively skipped from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seat on seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the officer took not the smallest notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not venture to sit down again in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) presence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) face, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except a certain insolence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) looked askance and rather indignantly at Raskolnikov; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) humiliating position, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) bearing was by no means in keeping with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) clothes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was the assistant superintendent. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt positively affronted.
<p/>'' What do you want? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) glance.
<p/>'' I was summoned... by a notice... '' Raskolnikov faltered. '' For the recovery of money due, from the student ,'' the head clerk interfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) papers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) flung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. '' Read that!'' <div class="bookquote">``Money? What money? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>thought Raskolnikov, <div class="bookquote">``but...
<p/>then... it's certainly not that . ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) trembled with joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A load was lifted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) back.
<p/>'' And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir? '' shouted the assistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more aggrieved.
<p/>'' You are told to come at nine, and now it's twelve!'' '' The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago,'' Raskolnikov answered loudly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), too, grew suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. '' And it's enough that I have come here ill with fever.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Kindly refrain from shouting!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not shouting, I'm speaking very quietly, it's you who are shouting at me. I'm a student, and allow no one to shout at me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>assistant</b></font>)</div>The assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) could only splutter inarticulately. He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) leaped up from his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) seat.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're in a government office, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>cried Raskolnikov, <div class="bookquote">``and you're smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect to all of us.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Be silent! You are in a government office. Don't be impudent, sir!'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.
<p/>The head clerk looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with a smile. The angry assistant superintendent was obviously disconcerted. '' That's not your business!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) shouted at last with unnatural loudness. '' Kindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>). Alexandr Grigorievitch. There is a complaint against you!
<p/>You don't pay your debts! You're a fine bird!'' But Raskolnikov was not listening now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had eagerly clutched at the paper, in haste to find an explanation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) read it once, and a second time, and still did not understand. '' What is this? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked the head clerk.
<p/>You must either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written declaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not to leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your property.
<p/>'' It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed against you according to the law.''
<p/>Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen roubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us for recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine months ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.
<p/>'' But I... am not in debt to anyone!'' '' That's not our business. We therefore summon you, hereupon.'' '' But she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) is my landlady!''
<p/>The head clerk looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tchebarov</b></font>) with a condescending smile of compassion, and at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire for the first time--as though he (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) would say: <div class="bookquote">``Well, how do you feel now?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And what if she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) is your landlady? '' '' But what did he (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery!
<p/>Was that worth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) stood, he (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) read, he (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) listened, he (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) answered, he (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) even asked questions himself, but all mechanically.
<p/>The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from overwhelming danger, that was what filled his (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) whole soul that moment without thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions or surmises, without doubts and without questioning.
<p/>It was an instant of full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very moment something like a thunderstorm took place in the office.
<p/>The assistant superintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikov's disrespect, still fuming and obviously anxious to keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wounded dignity, pounced on the unfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) came in with an exceedingly silly smile.
<p/>'' You shameful hussy! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shouted suddenly at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) voice. -LRB-The lady in mourning had left the office.-RRB-
<p/>'' What was going on at your house last night? Eh! A disgrace again , you're a scandal to the whole street.
<p/>Fighting and drinking again. Do you want the house of correction? Why, I have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the eleventh!
<p/>And here you are again, again, you... you...! '' The paper fell out of Raskolnikov's hands, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked wildly at the smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) soon saw what it meant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) listened with pleasure, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) longed to laugh and laugh... all his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) nerves were on edge.
<p/>the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped short, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not be stopped except by force.
<p/>But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of abuse became, the more amiable she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) looked, and the more seductive the smiles she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) lavished on the terrible assistant.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) moved uneasily, and curtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) word: and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) found it.
<p/>There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently, though with a strong German accent, ``and no sort of scandal, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) honour came drunk, and it's the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain, and I am not to blame...
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ilya Petrovitch! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>As for the smart lady, at first she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) positively trembled before the storm. '' Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain, and honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any scandal myself.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles again, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte with one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ganz broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed
<p/>And then I called the porter, and Karl came, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) took Karl and hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) in the eye; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the cheek.
<p/>and I said so. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain, and I screamed.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) opened the window over the canal, and stood in the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace.
<p/>And Karl pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) away from the window by his (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) coat, and it is true, Mr. Captain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) tore sein rock .
<p/>The idea of squealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)! And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) shouted that man muss pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) fifteen roubles damages.
<p/>And I did pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), Mr. Captain, five roubles for sein rock . And he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused all the scandal. '
<p/>I will show you up,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said, `for I can write to all the papers about you.''' <div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was an author?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable house... '' <div class="bookquote">``Now then! Enough! I have told you already...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>an visitor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ilya Petrovitch! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the head clerk</b></font>)</div>the head clerk repeated significantly. The assistant glanced rapidly at him (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>); the head clerk slightly shook his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) head. ''...
<p/>So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it you for the last time,'' the assistant went on.
<p/>If there is a scandal in your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in the lock-up, as it is called in polite society.
<p/>'' Do you hear? So a literary man, an author took five roubles for his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) coat-tail in an `honourable house'? A nice set, these authors!
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. '' There was a scandal the other day in a restaurant, too.
<p/>An author had eaten his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) dinner and would not pay; `I'll write a satire on you,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>). And there was another of them on a steamer
<p/>last week used the most disgraceful language to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his (<font color='blue'><b>councillor</b></font>) wife and daughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectioner's shop the other day.
<p/>They are like that, authors, literary men, students, town-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one day.
<p/>Then you had better be careful! Do you hear? '' With hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all directions, and so curtsied herself to the door.
<p/>But at the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) stumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open face and splendid thick fair whiskers.
<p/>Luise Ivanovna made haste to curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) fluttered out of the office.
<p/>This was the superintendent of the district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. '' Again thunder and lightning--a hurricane!'' said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya Petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone.
<p/>Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) shoulders at each step.
<p/>Here, if you will kindly look: an author, or a student, has been one at least, does not pay his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) debts, has given an I O U, won't clear out of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) room, and complaints are constantly being lodged against him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>), and here he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) has been pleased to make a protest against my smoking in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) presence!
<p/>'' You are aroused again, you are fuming again! I heard it on the stairs!'' '' Well, what then!'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) behaves like a cad himself, and just look at him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>), please.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder, you can't bear a slight, I daresay you took offence at something and went too far yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikodim Fomitch</b></font>)</div>continued Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably to Raskolnikov.
<p/>Here's the gentleman, and very attractive he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is!'' '' But you were wrong there; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is a capital fellow, I assure you, but explosive, explosive!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no stopping him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)! And then it's all over! And at the bottom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s a heart of gold!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant... '' <div class="bookquote">``And what a regiment it was, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>nickname the Explosive Lieutenant</b></font>)</div>cried Ilya Petrovitch, much gratified at this agreeable banter, though still sulky.
<p/>Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant to them all. '' Excuse me, Captain,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) began easily, suddenly addressing Nikodim Fomitch, <div class="bookquote">``will you enter into my position?...
<p/>I am ready to ask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick and shattered -LRB-shattered was the word he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) used-RRB- by poverty.
<p/>I am not studying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money.... I have a mother and sister in the province of X.
<p/>My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is so exasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for the last four months, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not even send up my dinner...
<p/>They will send it to me, and I will pay. and I don't understand this I O U at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is asking me to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on this
<p/>I O U. How am I to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? Judge for yourselves!... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikodim Fomitch</b></font>)</div>'' But that is not our business, you know,'' the head clerk was observing.
<p/>Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently appeared to be rummaging among his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) papers and to be contemptuously oblivious of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>'' Yes, yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to explain... '' ``Allow me to explain that I have been living with her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) for nearly three years and at first... at first...
<p/>for why should I not confess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) daughter, it was a verbal promise, freely given...
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) was a girl... indeed, I liked her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>), though I was not in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>)... a youthful affair in fact...
<p/>that is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those days, and I led a life of...
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we've no time to waste,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph; but Raskolnikov stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hotly, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suddenly found it exceedingly difficult to speak.
<p/>I was very heedless...'' '' But excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it all happened... In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.
<p/>I remained lodging there as before, and when my landlady moved into her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) present quarters, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) said to me... and in a friendly way... that she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had complete trust in me, but still, would I not give her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) an I O U for one hundred and fifteen roubles, all the debt I owed her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) said if only I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) that, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) would never, never--those were her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) own words--make use of that I O U till I could pay of myself... and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to eat, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) takes action against me.
<p/>But a year ago, the girl died of typhus. What am I to say to that?'' '' All these affecting details are no business of ours.
<p/>You must give a written undertaking but as for your love affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with that.''
<p/>'' Ilya Petrovitch interrupted rudely. '' <div class="bookquote">``Come now... you are harsh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikodim Fomitch</b></font>)</div>muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down at the table and also beginning to write.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) looked a little ashamed. <div class="bookquote">``Write! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the head clerk</b></font>)</div>said the head clerk to Raskolnikov. '' Write what? '' the latter asked, gruffly.
<p/>Raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) more casually and contemptuously after his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) speech, but strange to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suddenly felt completely indifferent to anyone's opinion, and this revulsion took place in a flash, in one instant.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had cared to think a little, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would have been amazed indeed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could have talked to them like that a minute before, forcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) feelings upon them.
<p/>Now if the whole room had been filled, not with police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would not have found one human word for them, so empty was his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart.
<p/>'' I will dictate to you. '' And where had those feelings come from? A gloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took conscious form in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) soul.
<p/>It was not the meanness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sentimental effusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter's triumph over him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) that had caused this sudden revulsion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Oh, what had he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) to do now with his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) own baseness, with all these petty vanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices?
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) had been sentenced to be burnt at that moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) would not have stirred, would hardly have heard the sentence to the end.
<p/>It was not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) understood, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) could never more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental effusions like his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that if they had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) own brothers and sisters and not police-officers, it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any circumstance of life.
<p/>And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the sensations he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) had known in his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) life.
<p/>The head clerk began dictating to him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) the usual form of declaration, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) could not pay, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) undertook to do so at a future date, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) would not leave the town, nor sell his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) property, and so on.
<p/>Something was happening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) entirely new, sudden and unknown. He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) had never experienced such a strange and awful sensation. ''
<p/>But you can't write, you can hardly hold the pen,'' observed the head clerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. '' Are you ill?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am giddy. Go on!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That's all. Sign it. '' The head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others.
<p/>Raskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) elbows on the table and pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands.
<p/>A strange idea suddenly occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), to get up at once, to go up to Nikodim Fomitch, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) everything that had happened yesterday, and then to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lodgings and to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) the things in the hole in the corner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt as if a nail were being driven into his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) skull. The impulse was so strong that he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) seat to carry it out.
<p/>'' Hadn't I better think a minute? '' flashed through his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) mind. '' No, better cast off the burden without thinking.
<p/>'' But all at once he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) stood still, rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly with Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>):
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's impossible, they'll both be released. To begin with, the whole story contradicts itself. Why should they have called the porter, if it had been their doing?
<p/>To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No, that would be too cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at the gate by both the porters and a woman as he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) went in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was walking with three friends, who left him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) only at the gate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) asked the porters to direct him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>), in the presence of the friends.
<p/>As for Koch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) spent half an hour at the silversmith's below, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) went up to the old woman and he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) at exactly a quarter to eight.
<p/>Now, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) have asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) way if he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) had been going with such an object? Now just consider...''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction?
<p/>They state themselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes later when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was unfastened.''
<p/>That's just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself in; and they'd have caught him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) for a certainty if Koch had not been an ass and gone to look for the porter too.
<p/>Koch keeps crossing himself and saying: `If I had been there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) would have jumped out and killed me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) axe.'
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) must have seized the interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha, ha!''
<p/>'' And no one saw the murderer?'' '' They might well not see him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>); the house is a regular Noah's Ark,'' said the head clerk, who was listening.
<p/>'' It's clear, quite clear,'' Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly. '' No, it is anything but clear,'' Ilya Petrovitch maintained. Raskolnikov picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hat and walked towards the door, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not reach it....
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) recovered consciousness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) found himself sitting in a chair, supported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing on the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and Nikodim Fomitch standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), looking intently at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could hardly hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pen when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was signing,'' said the head clerk, settling back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) place, and taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) work again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) got up from the chair. '' What's this? Are you ill?'' Nikodim Fomitch asked, rather sharply. '' '' Have you been ill long?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had, of course, come to look at the sick man when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fainted, but retired at once when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) recovered.
<p/>'' cried Ilya Petrovitch from his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) place, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>), too, was looking through papers. '' Since yesterday,'' muttered Raskolnikov in reply.
<p/>'' Did you go out yesterday?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Though you were ill?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

(<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And where did you go, may I ask?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Along the street.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Short and clear. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered sharply, jerkily, without dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) black feverish eyes before Ilya Petrovitch's stare.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) can scarcely stand upright. And you... '' Nikodim Fomitch was beginning. '' No matter,'' Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly.
<p/>Nikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest, but glancing at the head clerk who was looking very hard at him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) did not speak.
<p/>There was a sudden silence. It was strange. '' Very well, then,'' concluded Ilya Petrovitch, <div class="bookquote">``we will not detain you. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ilya Petrovitch</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) caught the sound of eager conversation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) departure, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim Fomitch.
<p/>Raskolnikov went out. In the street, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) faintness passed off completely. '' A search--there will be a search at once,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) repeated to himself, hurrying home.
<p/>'' The brutes! they suspect. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) former terror mastered him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) completely again. CHAPTER II '' And what if there has been a search already?
<p/>What if I find them in my room? '' But here was his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) rushed to the corner, slipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand under the paper, pulled the things out and lined his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pockets with them.
<p/>There were eight articles in all: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hardly looked to see; then four small leather cases.
<p/>Even Nastasya had not touched it. But heavens! how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) have left all those things in the hole? There was a chain, too, merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked like a decoration....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) put them all in the different pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) trousers, trying to conceal them as much as possible.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) took the purse, too. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) room, leaving the door open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walked quickly and resolutely, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt shattered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) senses about him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was afraid of pursuit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an hour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pursuit, and so at all costs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) must hide all traces before then.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) must clear everything up while he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) still had some strength, some reasoning power left him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).... Where was he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to go?
<p/>That had long been settled: <div class="bookquote">``Fling them into the canal, and all traces hidden in the water, the thing would be at an end.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had decided in the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) delirium when several times he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had had the impulse to get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wandered along the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked several times at the steps running down to the water, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not think of carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) plan; either rafts stood at the steps' edge, and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and people were swarming everywhere.
<p/>Moreover he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could be seen and noticed from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go down on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But to get rid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. And what if the boxes were to float instead of sinking?
<p/>Even as it was, everyone he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met seemed to stare and look round, as if they had nothing to do but to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>And of course they would. '' Why is it, or can it be my fancy? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought. At last the thought struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that it might be better to go to the Neva.
<p/>There were not so many people there, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be less observed, and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further off.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wondered how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have been wandering for a good half-hour, worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it before.
<p/>And that half-hour he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lost over an irrational plan, simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had thought of it in delirium! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had become extremely absent and forgetful and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was aware of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly must make haste. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked towards the Neva along V-- Prospect, but on the way another idea struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Would it not be better to go somewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things in some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot perhaps?
<p/>'' Why to the Neva? '' And though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a sound one.
<p/>For coming out of V-- Prospect towards the square, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw on the left a passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard.
<p/>On the right hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not destined to go there. Here was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was lying.
<p/>At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed, apparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding.
<p/>It was probably a carriage builder's or carpenter's shed; the whole place from the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to throw it, he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) thought.
<p/>Not seeing anyone in the yard, he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) slipped in, and at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, <div class="bookquote">``Standing here strictly forbidden.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>workmen cab-drivers</b></font>)</div>This was all the better, for there would be nothing suspicious about his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) going in. '' Here I could throw it all in a heap and get away!''
<p/>Looking round once more, with his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) hand already in his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) noticed against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands, and using all his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) strength turned it over.
<p/>The other side of the wall was a street. Under the stone was a small hollow in the ground, and he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) immediately emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) pocket into it.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher.
<p/>The purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. But he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) foot.
<p/>Nothing could be noticed. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense, almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) for an instant, as it had in the police-office.
<p/>'' I have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of looking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since the house was built, and will lie as many years more.
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless laugh, and went on laughing all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) was crossing the square.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) reached the K-- Boulevard where two days before he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) had come upon that girl, his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) laughter suddenly ceased.
<p/>And if it were found, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue! '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) laughed. Other ideas crept into his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat on which after the girl was gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) had sat and pondered, and that it would be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had given the twenty copecks:
<p/>All his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) ideas now seemed to be circling round some single point, and he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) felt that there really was such a point, and that now, now, he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) was left facing that point--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) walked, looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) angrily and distractedly. '' Damn it all! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.
<p/>'' If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how stupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day!
<p/>How despicably I fawned upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I care for them all, and my fawning upon them!
<p/>It is not that at all! It is not that at all!'' Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly confounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if I really had a certain and definite object, how is it
<p/>I did not even glance into the purse and don't know what I had there, for which I have undergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base, filthy degrading business?
<p/>And here I wanted at once to throw into the water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen either...
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) had known it all before, and it was not a new question for him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>), even when it was decided in the night without hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though it could not possibly be otherwise....
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) had known it all, and understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out of it....
<p/>It is because I am very ill,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) decided grimly at last, <div class="bookquote">``I have been worrying and fretting myself, and I don't know what I am doing...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>how's that? '' Yes, that was so , that was all so. Yes, so it was. '' Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been worrying myself....
<p/>I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what if I don't get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) walked on without resting. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had a terrible longing for some distraction, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not know what to do, what to attempt.
<p/>A new overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for everything surrounding him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.
<p/>All who met him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) were loathsome to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) loathed their faces, their movements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might have spat at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) or bitten him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. '' Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lives here, in that house,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord!
<p/>Here it's the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know, though; have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance?
<p/>Never mind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) the day after ; well, and so I will!
<p/>Besides I really cannot go further now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went up to Razumihin's room on the fifth floor. The latter was at home in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) garret, busily writing at the moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) opened the door himself.
<p/>It was four months since they had seen each other. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) face showed surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Is it you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) cried. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) looked his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) comrade up and down; then after a brief pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) whistled.
<p/>'' As hard up as all that! Why, brother, you've cut me out! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) added, looking at Raskolnikov's rags. ''
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was in even worse condition than his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own, Razumihin saw at once that his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) visitor was ill.
<p/>Come sit down, you are tired, I'll be bound. '' '' Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that? ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) began feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) pulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand. '' Never mind,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have come for this: I have no lessons....
<p/>I wanted,... but I don't really want lessons... ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' But I say! You are delirious, you know! '' Razumihin observed, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) carefully.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had mounted the stairs to Razumihin's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had not realised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) would be meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) friend face to face.
<p/>Now, in a flash, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) knew, that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was least of all disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the wide world.
<p/>'' No, I am not. '' Raskolnikov got up from the sofa. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) spleen rose within him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) almost choked with rage at himself as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) crossed Razumihin's threshold.
<p/>'' Good-bye,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) said abruptly, and walked to the door. <div class="bookquote">``Stop, stop! You queer fish.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, again pulling away his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this is... almost insulting! I won't let you go like that.''
<p/>but you who could help... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer, I mean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing.
<p/>'' Well, then, I came to you because I know no one Do you hear? Nothing at all... no one's services...
<p/>no one's sympathy. I am by myself... alone. Come, that's enough. Leave me alone.'' <div class="bookquote">``Stay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman.
<p/>I have no lessons, do you see, and I don't care about that, but there's a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) takes the place of a lesson.
<p/>As you like for all I care. I would not exchange him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) for five lessons. He (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>)'s doing publishing of a kind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they have!
<p/>The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I was a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is setting up for being advanced, not that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has an inkling of anything, but, of course, I encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>Here are two signatures of the German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses the question, `Is woman a human being?'
<p/>Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a contribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will expand these two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles for the job, and I've had six already in advance.
<p/>When we have finished this, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of the dullest scandals out of the second part of Les Confessions we have marked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was a kind of Radishchev.
<p/>And, of course, triumphantly proves that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is. It will do! You may be sure I don't contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>Rousseau</b></font>), hang him (<font color='blue'><b>Rousseau</b></font>)!
<p/>If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all those are provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in advance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.
<p/>Well, would you like to do the second signature of ' Is woman a human being? ' And when you have finished the signature there will be another three roubles for you.
<p/>And please don't think I am doing you a service; quite the contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; to begin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly adrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the most part.
<p/>The only comfort is, that it's bound to be a change for the better. Though who can tell, maybe it's sometimes for the worse.
<p/>Will you take it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles and without a word went out.
<p/>But when Raskolnikov was in the next street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned back, mounted the stairs to Razumihin's again and laying on the table the German article and the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word.
<p/>Razumihin gazed after him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) in astonishment. '' Are you raving, or what? '' Razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last. ''
<p/>What farce is this? You'll drive me crazy too... what did you come to see me for, damn you?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't want... translation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs.
<p/>'' Then what the devil do you want?'' shouted Razumihin from above. Raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence. '' Hey, there!
<p/>Where are you living? '' No answer. '' Well, confound you then! '' But Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street.
<p/>A coachman, after shouting at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) two or three times, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) a violent lash on the back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) whip, for having almost fallen under his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) horses' hoofs.
<p/>The lash so infuriated him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) dashed away to the railing -LRB-for some unknown reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been walking in the very middle of the bridge in the traffic-RRB-.
<p/>On the Nikolaevsky Bridge he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant incident. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) angrily clenched and ground his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) teeth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heard laughter, of course. '' Serves him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) right!'' '' A pickpocket I dare say. '' <div class="bookquote">``Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels on purpose; and you have to answer for him (<font color='blue'><b>pickpocket</b></font>).
<p/>But while he (<font color='blue'><b>pickpocket</b></font>) stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered after the retreating carriage, and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>pickpocket</b></font>) back, he (<font color='blue'><b>pickpocket</b></font>) suddenly felt someone thrust money into his (<font color='blue'><b>pickpocket</b></font>) hand.
<p/>It was an elderly woman in a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) daughter, wearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It's a regular profession, that's what it is. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>pickpocket</b></font>) looked. '' Take it, my good man, in Christ's name.
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) dress and appearance they might well have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) for a beggar asking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) doubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and turned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty copecks. The sky was without a cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the Neva.
<p/>The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the bridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight, and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.
<p/>The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) now completely.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was attending the university, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had hundreds of times--generally on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) way home--stood still on this spot, gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was especially familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). It left him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) strangely cold; this gorgeous picture was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) blank and lifeless.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) vividly recalled those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) that it was no mere chance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) recalled them now.
<p/>It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) as strange and grotesque, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) should have stopped at the same spot as before, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) actually imagined he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could think the same thoughts, be interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)... so short a time ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wondered every time at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting himself, put off finding the explanation of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) now--all his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) old past, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) old thoughts, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) old problems and theories, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sight. Making an unconscious movement with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fist.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) arm flung it into the water; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned and went home.
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had cut himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment. Evening was coming on when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) reached home, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) must have been walking about six hours.
<p/>Undressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lay down on the sofa, drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) greatcoat over him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), and at once sank into oblivion....
<p/>How and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) came back he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not remember. It was dusk when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was waked up by a fearful scream.
<p/>Good God, what a scream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears, blows and curses he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had never heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy.
<p/>In terror he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing and cursing grew louder and louder.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was howling, shrieking and wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not make out what she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was talking about
<p/>And then to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) intense amazement he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) caught the voice of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) landlady. ; she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was beseeching, no doubt, not to be beaten, for she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs.
<p/>The voice of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost a croak; but he (<font color='blue'><b>assailant</b></font>), too, was saying something, and just as quickly and indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering.
<p/>All at once Raskolnikov trembled; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch. Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) is kicking her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), banging her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) head against the steps-- that's clear , that can be told from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys and all the staircases; he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors banging.
<p/>How is it, is the world topsy-turvy? '' But why, why, and how could it be? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) repeated, thinking seriously that he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) had gone mad.
<p/>But no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) heard too distinctly! And they would come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) then next, <div class="bookquote">``for no doubt... it's all about that... about yesterday....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) would have fastened his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) door with the latch, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) could not lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) hand... besides, it would be useless.
<p/>Good God! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Terror gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart like ice, tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and numbed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes, began gradually to subside.
<p/>The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>), too, seemed to be silent, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) could not be heard.
<p/>'' Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) have gone away? Good Lord! '' Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still weeping and moaning...
<p/>Now the crowd was going from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling to one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a whisper.
<p/>and then her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) door slammed.... There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates of the block. '' But, good God, how could it be!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of infinite terror as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had never experienced before.
<p/>And why, why had he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) come here!'' Raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes. Suddenly a bright light flashed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) room.
<p/>Looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) carefully and ascertaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was not asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.
<p/>Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate of soup. '' You've eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You've been trudging about all day, and you're shaking with fever.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nastasya... what were they beating the landlady for? ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) looked intently at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' Who beat the landlady?'' <div class="bookquote">``Just now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant superintendent, on the stairs
<p/>.... Why was he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) ill-treating her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) like that, and... why was he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Nastasya</b></font>)</div>Nastasya scrutinised him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>), silent and frowning, and her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) scrutiny lasted a long time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) felt uneasy, even frightened at her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) searching eyes. '' Nastasya, why don't you speak? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) said timidly at last in a weak voice.
<p/>'' It's the blood,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) answered at last softly, as though speaking to herself. '' Blood? What blood? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) muttered, growing white and turning towards the wall.
<p/>Nastasya still looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) without speaking. '' Nobody has been beating the landlady,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) declared at last in a firm, resolute voice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), hardly able to breathe. '' I heard it myself.... I was not asleep... I was sitting up,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) said still more timidly.
<p/>'' I listened a long while. The assistant superintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the flats.''
<p/>'' No one has been here. That's the blood crying in your ears. When there's no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancying things....
<p/>Will you eat something?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>), watching him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>). '' Give me something to drink...
<p/>Nastasya. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water. He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling some on his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) neck.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) was ill; he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) was in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.
<p/>Sometimes it seemed as though there were a number of people round him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>); they wanted to take him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) away somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>).
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>), and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>); they threatened him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>), plotted something together, laughed, and mocked at him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) remembered Nastasya often at his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) bedside; he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) distinguished another person, too, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) seemed to know very well, though he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) could not remember who he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) was, and this fretted him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>), even made him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) cry.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) had been lying there a month; at other times it all seemed part of the same day.
<p/>But of that --of that he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) had no recollection, and yet every minute he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) had forgotten something he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) ought to remember.
<p/>Then followed forgetfulness. CHAPTER III He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) remembered a great deal afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) worried and tormented himself trying to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable terror.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone always prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) by force, and he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) sank back into impotence and forgetfulness.
<p/>On fine days the sun shone into the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right wall and the corner near the door.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) returned to complete consciousness. It happened at ten o'clock in the morning. Nastasya was standing beside him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) with another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) very inquisitively.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) was a young man with a beard, wearing a full, short-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The landlady was peeping in at the half-opened door.
<p/>Raskolnikov sat up. '' Who is this, Nastasya? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked, pointing to the young man. '' I say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'s himself again!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is himself,'' echoed the man. Concluding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) senses, the landlady closed the door and disappeared.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat and buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and laziness, and absurdly bashful.
<p/>But at that moment the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was so tall, Razumihin came in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was always shy and dreaded conversations or discussions. '' Who... are you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went on, addressing the man. ''
<p/>What a cabin it is! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cried. '' I am always knocking my head. You call this a lodging! So you are conscious, brother?
<p/>I've just heard the news from Pashenka.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has just come to,'' said Nastasya. '' Just come to,'' echoed the man again, with a smile.
<p/>'' And who are you? '' Razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>). '' My name is Vrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, but Vrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is my friend.
<p/>And who are you?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and I've come on business. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please sit down. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the table. '' It's a good thing you've come to, brother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went on to Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' For the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk anything. We had to give you tea in spoonfuls.
<p/>I brought Zossimov to see you twice. You remember Zossimov? He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) examined you carefully and said at once it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head.
<p/>Some nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) says you have not had enough beer and radish, but it's nothing much, it will pass and you will be all right.
<p/>Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is making quite a name. Come, I won't keep you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, addressing the man again.
<p/>You must know, Rodya, this is the second time they have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' Will you explain what you want? Who was it came before?'' '' That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please, sir.
<p/>That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in our office, too.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was more intelligent than you, don't you think so?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At your mamma's request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whom I presume you have heard more than once, a remittance is sent to you from our office,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man began, addressing Raskolnikov.
<p/>If you are in an intelligible condition, I've thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as Semyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma's request instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions.
<p/>'' Yes, indeed, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is of more weight than I am. '' '' Quite so; go on. '' '' Do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sir?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I remember... Vahrushin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov said dreamily. '' You hear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knows Vahrushin,'' cried Razumihin. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is in `an intelligible condition'!
<p/>And I see you are an intelligent man too. Well, it's always pleasant to hear words of wisdom.'' '' That's the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch.
<p/>And at the request of your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the same manner through him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not refuse this time also, and sent instructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you thirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come.
<p/>'' '' That `hoping for better to come' is the best thing you've said, though `your mamma' is not bad either.
<p/>Come then, what do you say? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fully conscious, eh?'' '' That's all right. If only he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) can sign this little paper.''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) can scrawl his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name. Have you got the book?'' '' Yes, here's the book.'' <div class="bookquote">``Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up.
<p/>I'll hold you. Take the pen and scribble `Raskolnikov' for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). For just now, brother, money is sweeter to us than treacle.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen. '' Not want it?'' <div class="bookquote">``I won't sign it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How the devil can you do without signing it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want... the money. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't want the money! Come, brother, that's nonsense, I bear witness. Don't trouble, please, it's only that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) travels again.
<p/>You are a man of judgment and we will take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in hand, that is, more simply, take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will sign it.
<p/>But that's pretty common with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at all times though.... Here.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' But I can come another time.'' '' No, no.
<p/>Now, Rodya, don't keep your visitor, you see he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) is waiting,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) made ready to hold Raskolnikov's hand in earnest.
<p/>Why should we trouble you? You are a man of judgment... '' Stop, I'll do it alone,'' said the latter, taking the pen and signing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name.
<p/>The messenger took out the money and went away. <div class="bookquote">``Bravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>answered Raskolnikov. '' Is there any soup?''
<p/>'' Some of yesterday's,'' answered Nastasya, who was still standing there. '' With potatoes and rice in it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know it by heart.
<p/>Bring soup and give us some tea.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull, unreasoning terror.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind to keep quiet and see what would happen. '' I believe I am not wandering. I believe it's reality,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought.
<p/>In a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announced that the tea would be ready directly. With the soup she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brought two spoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on.
<p/>The table was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean. '' It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us up a couple of bottles of beer.
<p/>We could empty them.'' '' Well, you are a cool hand,'' muttered Nastasya, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) departed to carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) orders.
<p/>Meanwhile Razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), as clumsily as a bear put his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) left arm round Raskolnikov's head, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was able to sit up, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) right hand gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that it might not burn him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov swallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third.
<p/>But after giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) must ask Zossimov whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) ought to have more.
<p/>Nastasya came in with two bottles of beer. '' And will you have tea?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on without the faculty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) moved back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) chair, pulled the soup and meat in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), and began eating as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had not touched food for three days.
<p/>I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) mumbled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) mouth full of beef, <div class="bookquote">``and it's all Pashenka, your dear little landlady, who sees to that
<p/>But here is the beer!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' ; she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) loves to do anything for me. I don't ask for it, but, of course, I don't object.
<p/>And here's Nastasya with the tea. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) is a quick girl. Nastasya, my dear, won't you have some beer?'' <div class="bookquote">``Get along with your nonsense!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' A cup of tea, then?'' '' A cup of tea, maybe. '' <div class="bookquote">``Pour it out. Stay, I'll pour it out myself.
<p/>As before, he (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) left arm round the sick man's head, raised him (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) up and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and earnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective means towards his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) friend's recovery.
<p/>Raskolnikov said nothing and made no resistance, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but even perhaps could have walked about.
<p/>But from some queer, almost animal, cunning he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) conceived the idea of hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) strength and lying low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.
<p/>Sit down. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) poured out two cups, left his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) dinner, and sat on the sofa again. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sense of repugnance.
<p/>After sipping a dozen spoonfuls of tea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suddenly released his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head, pushed the spoon away capriciously, and sank back on the pillow.
<p/>There were actually real pillows under his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head now, down pillows in clean cases, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) observed that, too, and took note of it.
<p/>Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) some raspberry tea,'' said Razumihin, going back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) chair and attacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) soup and beer again.
<p/>'' '' And where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to get raspberries for you? '' asked Nastasya, balancing a saucer on her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of sugar.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'ll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts of things have been happening while you have been laid up.
<p/>When you decamped in that rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I resolved to find you out and punish you.
<p/>This lodging of yours I had forgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know it; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the Five Corners, Harlamov's house.
<p/>I set to work that very day. How I ran about making inquiries for you! I kept trying to find that Harlamov's house, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov's,
<p/>but Buch's. How one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and I went on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy
<p/>, in two minutes they looked you up! Your name is down there.'' '' My name!'' <div class="bookquote">``I should think so; and yet a General
<p/>Kobelev they could not find while I was there. Well, it's a long story. But as soon as I did land on this place, I soon got to know all your affairs--all, all
<p/>I made the acquaintance of Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr. Zametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office, and, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows...''

'' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s got round her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>),'' Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly. '' Why don't you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Nikiforovna?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a one!''  (<font color='red'><b>Nastasya</b></font>)</div>Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a giggle. '' I am not Nikiforovna, but Petrovna,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) added suddenly, recovering from her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) mirth.
<p/>Well, brother, to make a long story short, I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant influences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day.
<p/>'' I'll make a note of it. I had not expected, brother, to find her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) so... prepossessing. Eh, what do you think?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov did not speak, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) still kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), full of alarm. '' And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect,'' Razumihin went on, not at all embarrassed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) silence.
<p/>'' Ah, the sly dog!'' Nastasya shrieked again. This conversation afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) unspeakable delight. '' It's a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way at first.
<p/>You ought to have approached her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) differently. She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) is, so to speak, a most unaccountable character. But we will talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) character later....
<p/>How could you let things come to such a pass that she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) gave up sending you your dinner? And that I O U?
<p/>You must have been mad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) daughter, Natalya Yegorovna, was alive?
<p/>But, talking of foolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as you would think at first sight?''
<p/>... I know all about it! But I see that's a delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me. ''
<p/>No,'' mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was better to keep up the conversation. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) isn't, is she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>)?
<p/>'' cried Razumihin, delighted to get an answer out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>). '' But she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) is not very clever either, eh? She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) is essentially, essentially an unaccountable character!
<p/>I am sometimes quite at a loss, I assure you.... She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) must be forty; she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) is thirty-six, and of course she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) has every right to say so.
<p/>But I swear I judge her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) intellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a sort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!
<p/>Only, seeing that you are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and that through the young lady's death she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has no need to treat you as a relation, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and dropped all your old relations with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) planned to get rid of you.
<p/>I don't understand it! Well, that's all nonsense. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose the I O U
<p/>My mother herself is almost a beggar... and I told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed,'' Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.
<p/>, for you assured her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) yourself that your mother would pay.'' '' It was base of me to say that... ''
<p/>Yes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at that point Mr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man.
<p/>Pashenka would never have thought of doing anything on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own account, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is too retiring; but the business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) puts the question, `Is there any hope of realising the I O U?'
<p/>Answer: there is, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a mother who would save her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) Rodya with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hundred and twenty-five roubles pension, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has to starve herself; and a sister, too, who would go into bondage for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sake.
<p/>I know all the ins and outs of your affairs now, my dear boy--it's not for nothing that you were so open with Pashenka when you were her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) prospective son-in-law, and I say all this as a friend....
<p/>But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is open; and a business man `listens and goes on eating' you up.
<p/>Well, then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without hesitation he (<font color='blue'><b>Tchebarov</b></font>) made a formal demand for payment.
<p/>When I heard of all this I wanted to blow him (<font color='blue'><b>Tchebarov</b></font>) up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time harmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stopping the whole affair, engaging that you would pay.
<p/>We called Tchebarov, flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Tchebarov</b></font>) ten roubles and got the I O U back from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tchebarov</b></font>), and here I have the honour of presenting it to you.
<p/>That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tchebarov</b></font>) was building upon.... Why do you start? I went security for you, brother. Do you understand? She (<font color='blue'><b>Tchebarov</b></font>) trusts your word now.
<p/>Here, take it, you see I have torn it. '' Razumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and turned to the wall without uttering a word.
<p/>Even Razumihin felt a twinge. '' I see, brother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said a moment later, <div class="bookquote">``that I have been playing the fool again.
<p/>I thought I should amuse you with my chatter, and I believe I have only made you cross. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Was it you
<p/>I did not recognise when I was delirious? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov asked, after a moment's pause without turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head. '' Yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I brought Zametov one day.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Zametov? The head clerk? What for? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov turned round quickly and fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes on Razumihin. '' What's the matter with you?...
<p/>What are you upset about? He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wanted to make your acquaintance because I talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) a lot about you.... How could I have found out so much except from him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is a capital fellow, brother, first-rate... in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own way, of course. Now we are friends--see each other almost every day.
<p/>I have moved into this part, you know. I have only just moved. I've been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to Luise Ivanovna once or twice....
<p/>Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna? '' Did I say anything in delirium?'' <div class="bookquote">``I should think so! You were beside yourself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' What did I rave about?'' '' What next? What did you rave about? What people do rave about.... Well, brother, now I must not lose time.
<p/>To work. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) got up from the table and took up his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cap. '' What did I rave about?'' <div class="bookquote">``How he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) keeps on!
<p/>But you said a lot about a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky Island, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant superintendent.
<p/>Are you afraid of having let out some secret? Don't worry yourself; you said nothing about a countess. And another thing that was of special interest to you was your own sock.
<p/>Zametov hunted all about your room for your socks, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) own scented, ring-bedecked fingers he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) gave you the rag.
<p/>And only then were you comforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched thing in your hand; we could not get it from you.
<p/>You whined, `Give me my sock.' It is most likely somewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you asked so piteously for fringe for your trousers.
<p/>Here are thirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an account of them in an hour or two.
<p/>I will let Zossimov know at the same time, though he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve.
<p/>And you, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wants a drink or anything else.
<p/>We tried to find out what sort of fringe, but we could not make it out. Now to business! And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted myself.
<p/>Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s a deep one!''  (<font color='red'><b>Nastasya</b></font>)</div>said Nastasya as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went out; then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist running downstairs after him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>Good-bye!'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) calls her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) Pashenka! She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was very eager to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would say to the landlady. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.
<p/>No sooner had she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) left the room than the sick man flung off the bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman.
<p/>With burning, twitching impatience he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) had waited for them to be gone so that he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) might set to work. But to what work?
<p/>Now, as though to spite him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>), it eluded him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>). '' Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not?
<p/>What if they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up, and then they will come in and tell me that it's been discovered long ago and that they have only...
<p/>What am I to do now? That's what I've forgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I remembered a minute ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment about him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wanted.
<p/>Suddenly, as though recalling something, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rushed to the corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it, put his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went to the stove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) trousers and the rags cut off his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pocket were lying there just as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had thrown them.
<p/>Yes, there it lay on the sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that Zametov could not have seen anything on it.
<p/>'' No one had looked, then! Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) remembered the sock about which Razumihin had just been telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>). '' Bah, Zametov!
<p/>The police office! And why am I sent for to the police office? Where's the notice? Bah! I am mixing it up; that was then.
<p/>I looked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill. But what did Zametov come for? Why did Razumihin bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) muttered, helplessly sitting on the sofa again. '' What does it mean? Am I still in delirium, or is it real?
<p/>I believe it is real.... Ah, I remember; I must escape! Make haste to escape. Yes, I must, I must escape!
<p/>Yes... but where? And where are my clothes? I've no boots. They've taken them away! They've hidden them! I understand! Ah, here is my coat--they passed that over!
<p/>And here is money on the table, thank God! And here's the I O U... I'll take the money and go and take another lodging.
<p/>They won't find me!... Yes, but the address bureau? They'll find me, Razumihin will find me. Better escape altogether... far away... to America, and let them do their worst!
<p/>And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... What else shall I take? They think I am ill!
<p/>They don't know that I can walk, ha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! If only I could get downstairs!
<p/>And what if they have set a watch there--policemen! What's this tea? Ah, and here is beer left, half a bottle, cold!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and gulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) breast.
<p/>But in another minute the beer had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head, and a faint and even pleasant shiver ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) spine.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lay down and pulled the quilt over him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more disconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>With a sense of comfort he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) nestled his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head into the pillow, wrapped more closely about him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old, ragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing sleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) woke up, hearing someone come in. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes and saw Razumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or not.
<p/>Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), as though trying to recall something. '' Ah, you are not asleep!
<p/>Here I am! Nastasya, bring in the parcel! '' Razumihin shouted down the stairs. '' You shall have the account directly.
<p/>'' '' What time is it? '' asked Raskolnikov, looking round uneasily. '' Yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it's almost evening, it will be six o'clock directly.
<p/>You have slept more than six hours. '' <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens! Have I?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And why not? It will do you good.
<p/>What's the hurry? A tryst, is it? We've all time before us. I've been waiting for the last three hours for you; I've been up twice and found you asleep.
<p/>I've called on Zossimov twice; not at home, only fancy! But no matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will turn up. And I've been out on my own business, too.
<p/>You know I've been moving to-day, moving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. But that's no matter, to business.
<p/>Give me the parcel, Nastasya. We will open it directly. And how do you feel now, brother?'' '' I am quite well, I am not ill.
<p/>Razumihin, have you been here long?'' <div class="bookquote">``I tell you I've been waiting for the last three hours.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No, before.'' <div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long have you been coming here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why I told you all about it this morning. Don't you remember? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov pondered.
<p/>The morning seemed like a dream to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin. '' Hm! '' said the latter, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) has forgotten.
<p/>I fancied then that you were not quite yourself. Now you are better for your sleep.... You really look much better.
<p/>First-rate! Well, to business. Look here, my dear boy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Hm</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my heart.
<p/>For we must make a man of you. Let's begin from the top. Do you see this cap? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and ordinary cap.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Rodya, my boy, don't oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and I shan't sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Let me try it on.'' <div class="bookquote">``Presently, afterwards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>said Raskolnikov, waving it off pettishly. Just right! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cried triumphantly, fitting it on, <div class="bookquote">``just your size!
<p/>Tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pudding basin when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) goes into any public place where other people wear their hats or caps.
<p/>People think he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) does it from slavish politeness, but it's simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) bird's nest; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is such a boastful fellow!
<p/>A proper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in its own way. Look, Nastasya, here are two specimens of headgear: this Palmerston'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took from the corner
<p/>Raskolnikov's old, battered hat, which for some unknown reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) called a Palmerston--<div class="bookquote">``or this jewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it, Nastasya!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), seeing that Raskolnikov did not speak. '' Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say,'' answered Nastasya.
<p/>'' Twenty copecks, silly! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cried, offended. '' Why, nowadays you would cost more than that--eighty copecks! And that only because it has been worn.
<p/>And it's bought on condition that when's it's worn out, they will give you another next year. Yes, on my word!
<p/>I assure you I am proud of these breeches,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) exhibited to Raskolnikov a pair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material.
<p/>Well, now let us pass to the United States of America, as they called them at school. '' No holes, no spots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoat to match, quite in the fashion.
<p/>You see, Rodya, to my thinking, the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the seasons; if you don't insist on having asparagus in January, you keep your money in your purse; and it's the same with this purchase.
<p/>It's summer now, so I've been buying summer things--warmer materials will be wanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case... especially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of coherence if not your higher standard of luxury.
<p/>And its being worn really is an improvement, it's softer, smoother.... Come, price them! What do you say? Two roubles twenty-five copecks!
<p/>They only do business on that system at Fedyaev's; if you've bought a thing once, you are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of your own free will.
<p/>And remember the condition: if you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing! Now for the boots. What do you say?
<p/>You see that they are a bit worn, but they'll last a couple of months, for it's foreign work and foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last week--he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) had only worn them six days, but he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) was very short of cash.
<p/>Price--a rouble and a half. A bargain?'' '' But perhaps they won't fit,'' observed Nastasya. '' Not fit? Just look!'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) pulled out of his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) pocket Raskolnikov's old, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud.
<p/>'' I did not go empty-handed--they took the size from this monster. We all did our best. And as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that.
<p/>Well now then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the suit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for the boots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four roubles fifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they were bought in the lo--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.
<p/>Here, to begin with are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front.... Forty-five copecks change in coppers. Will you take it?
<p/>And so, Rodya, you are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will serve, and even has a style of its own.
<p/>That comes from getting one's clothes from Sharmer's! As for your socks and other things, I leave them to you; we've twenty-five roubles left.
<p/>And as for Pashenka and paying for your lodging, don't you worry. I tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'ll trust you for anything. And now, brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you will throw off your illness with your shirt.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me be! I don't want to!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov waved him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had listened with disgust to Razumihin's efforts to be playful about his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) purchases.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, brother, don't tell me I've been trudging around for nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin insisted. '' Nastasya, don't be bashful, but help me--that's it,'' and in spite of Raskolnikov's resistance he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) linen.
<p/>The latter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing. '' It will be long before I get rid of them,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought.
<p/>'' What money was all that bought with? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked at last, gazing at the wall. '' Money? Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, your mother sent it.
<p/>Have you forgotten that, too?'' <div class="bookquote">``I remember now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>said Raskolnikov after a long, sullen silence. Razumihin looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), frowning and uneasy.
<p/>The door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiar to Raskolnikov came in. CHAPTER IV Zossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face and straight flaxen hair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had on a light grey fashionable loose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loose, fashionable and spick and span; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) linen was irreproachable, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watch-chain was massive.
<p/>In manner he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was slow and, as it were, nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made efforts to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) self-importance, but it was apparent at every instant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fat finger. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was twenty-seven. All his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acquaintances found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tedious, but said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was clever at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work.
<p/>I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?'' said Zossimov to Raskolnikov, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the sofa, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) settled himself as comfortably as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could.
<p/>'' I've been to you twice to-day, brother. You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s come to himself,'' cried Razumihin. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is still depressed,'' Razumihin went on.
<p/>'' We've just changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) linen and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) almost cried. '' '' That's very natural; you might have put it off if he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) did not wish it....
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) pulse is first-rate. Is your head still aching, eh?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am well , I am perfectly well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov declared positively and irritably.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with glittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to the wall.
<p/>Zossimov watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) intently. '' Very good.... Going on all right,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said lazily. '' Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eaten anything?

<p/>You are coming? '' Razumihin said to Zossimov. '' Don't forget, you promised.'' '' All right, only rather later. What are you going to do?''
<p/>All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is new too--he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some business of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).

<p/>'' Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) does! and what of it? I don't care if he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) does take bribes,'' Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability.
<p/>'' I don't praise him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) for taking bribes. I only say he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is a nice man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) own way! But if one looks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left?

<p/>'' Lizaveta,'' murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly. '' Lizaveta, who sold old clothes. Didn't you know her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) used to come here.
<p/>Raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) picked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began examining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the petals and how many lines on them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mended a shirt for you, too. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) arms and legs as lifeless as though they had been cut off.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not attempt to move, but stared obstinately at the flower. '' But what about the painter? '' Zossimov interrupted Nastasya's chatter with marked displeasure.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sighed and was silent. '' Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) was accused of the murder,'' Razumihin went on hotly. '' Was there evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) then?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Evidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and that's what we have to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and Pestryakov, at first.

<p/>Foo! how stupidly it's all done, it makes one sick, though it's not one's business! Pestryakov may be coming to-night... ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div><p/>Zossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not stir. '' But I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you. What a busybody you are!''
<p/>Zossimov observed. '' Maybe I am, but we will get him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) off anyway,'' shouted Razumihin, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) fist down on the table.

<p/>'' what is offensive is that they lie and worship their own lying.... I respect Porfiry, but... What threw them out at first?
<p/>The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter it was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the murderers--that was their logic!''
<p/>'' But don't excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not help that.... And, by the way, I've met that man Koch.

<p/>And this case might be the means of introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological data alone how to get on the track of the real man. '

<p/>Eh! Do you know the details of the case?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am waiting to hear about the painter.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, yes! Well, here's the story.
<p/>Early on the third day after the murder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though they accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an unexpected fact turned up.
<p/>A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a dram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller's case containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. '
<p/>The day before yesterday, just after eight o'clock'--mark the day and the hour!--'a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me already that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and asked me to give him (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) two roubles for them.
<p/>When I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) got them, he (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) picked them up in the street. I did not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) anything more.'
<p/>I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) a note'--a rouble that is--`for I thought if he (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) did not pawn it with me he (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) would with another.
<p/>I am telling you Dushkin's story. ' It would all come to the same thing-- he (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>)'d spend it on drink, so the thing had better be with me.
<p/>the quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any rumours, I'll take it to the police.'
<p/>for I know this Dushkin, he (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) is a pawnbroker and a receiver of stolen goods, and he (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) did not cheat Nikolay out of a thirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police.
<p/>The further you hide it Of course, that's all taradiddle; he (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) lies like a horse, He (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) was simply afraid. But no matter, to return to Dushkin's story. '
<p/>I've known this peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) comes from the same province and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan men.
<p/>And though Nikolay is not a drunkard, he (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) drinks, and I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) had a job in that house, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) got the rouble he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) changed it, had a couple of glasses, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) change and went out.
<p/>But I did not see Dmitri with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) then. And the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe.
<p/>I knew them, and I felt suspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman lent money on pledges.
<p/>I went to the house, and began to make careful inquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, <div class="bookquote">``Is Nikolay here?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes, and went out again.
<p/>Dmitri didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) again and is finishing the job alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on the second floor.
<p/>When I heard all that I did not say a word to anyone'--that's Dushkin's tale--`but I found out what I could about the murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever.
<p/>And at eight o'clock this morning'--that was the third day, you understand--'I saw Nikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) could understand what was said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) sat down on the bench and did not speak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man
<p/>I knew asleep on a bench and our two boys. '' Have you seen Dmitri?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``No, I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>).
<p/>'' And you've not been here either?'' '' Not since the day before yesterday,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). '' And where did you sleep last night?''
<p/>I found them in the street,'' and the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) said it was a bit queer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) did not look at me.
<p/>Did you hear what happened that very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I had not heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and all the while he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was listening, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) eyes were staring out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) head
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In Peski, with the Kolomensky men. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And where did you get those ear-rings? '' I asked. '' '' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) turned as white as chalk.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) all about it and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) hat and began getting up. I wanted to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). ''
<p/>And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the bar; but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.
<p/>Wait a bit, Nikolay,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``won't you have a drink? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I have not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) doing, as clear as could be...'''
<p/>Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay; they detained Dushkin and searched his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) house; Dmitri, too, was arrested; the Kolomensky men also were turned inside out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div>said Zossimov. '' Wait! Hear the end. And the day before yesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had gone there, taken the silver cross off his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) neck and asked for a dram for it. They gave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>).
<p/>A few minutes afterwards the woman went to the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw in the stable adjoining he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had made a noose of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) sash from the beam, stood on a block of wood, and was trying to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) neck in the noose.
<p/>The woman screeched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hardest; people ran in. ' So that's what you are up to!' `Take me,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) says, `to such-and-such a police officer; I'll confess everything.'
<p/>Well, they took him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) to that police station--that is here--with a suitable escort. So they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) this and that, how old he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) is, `twenty-two,' and so on.
<p/>At the question, `When you were working with Dmitri, didn't you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a time?'--answer: `To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did not notice them.' '
<p/>And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same day Widow So-and-so and her (<font color='blue'><b>Widow</b></font>) sister were murdered and robbed?' 'I never knew a thing about it.
<p/>And didn't you hear anything, any noise, and so on?' ' We heard nothing special.' ' The first I heard of it was from Afanasy Pavlovitch the day before yesterday.' '
<p/>And where did you find the ear-rings?' 'I found them on the pavement.' `Why didn't you go to work with Dmitri the other day?' '
<p/>Oh, in such-and-such a place.' `Why did you run away from Dushkin's?' `Because I was awfully frightened.' `What were you frightened of?'
<p/>Because I was drinking.' ' And where were you drinking?' ' `That I should be accused.' `How could you be frightened, if you felt free from guilt?'
<p/>Now, Zossimov, you may not believe me, that question was put literally in those words. I know it for a fact, it was repeated to me exactly!
<p/>What do you say to that?'' '' Well, anyway, there's the evidence. '' <div class="bookquote">``I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question, of their own idea of themselves.
<p/>Well, so they squeezed and squeezed him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) confessed: 'I did not find it in the street, but in the flat where I was painting with Dmitri.' '
<p/>`Why, Dmitri and I were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and Dmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) ran off
<p/>I ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I ran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen were there
<p/>And the porter swore at me, and the other porter swore, too, and the porter's wife came out, and swore at us, too; and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) swore at us, too, for Dmitri
<p/>And how was that?' and I after him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). I don't remember. and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitri's hair and knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) down and began beating him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>).
<p/>And Dmitri, too, caught me by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper but in a friendly way, for sport.
<p/>And then Dmitri escaped and ran into the street, and I ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>); but I did not catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), and went back to the flat alone; I had to clear up my things.
<p/>I began putting them together, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the corner by the door, I stepped on the box.
<p/>I saw it lying there wrapped up in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them, and in the box were the ear-rings...'
<p/>Raskolnikov cried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) slowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the door? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes... why? What's the matter? What's wrong? ''
<p/>Razumihin, too, got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) seat. '' Nothing,'' Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. All were silent for a while.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) must have waked from a dream,'' Razumihin said at last, looking inquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) head.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got a rouble from him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>).
<p/>'' Well, go on,'' said Zossimov. '' What next?'' <div class="bookquote">``What next? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) told a lie saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) found them in the street, and went off drinking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) keeps repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) old story about the murder: 'I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.' '
<p/>And why didn't you come to the police till now?' 'I was frightened.' ' And why did you try to hang yourself?' '
<p/>From anxiety.' `What anxiety?' `That I should be accused of it.' Well, that's the whole story. And now what do you suppose they deduced from that?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, there's no supposing. There's a clue, such as it is, a fact. You wouldn't have your painter set free?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now they've simply taken him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) for the murderer. They haven't a shadow of doubt. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That's nonsense. You are excited.
<p/>You must admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old woman's box have come into Nikolay's hands, they must have come there somehow.
<p/>But what about the ear-rings? That's a good deal in such a case. '' <div class="bookquote">``How did they get there? How did they get there?
<p/>How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail to see the character of the man in the whole story?

<p/>They came into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand precisely as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has told us--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stepped on the box and picked it up.'' <div class="bookquote">``The holy truth!
<p/>The porter and Koch and Pestryakov and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who was sitting in the porter's lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just got out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm, that is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on the ground, was lying on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) beating him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), while Dmitri hung on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) hair, beating him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), too.

<p/>They were sworn at on all sides while they `like children' -LRB-the very words of the witnesses-RRB- were falling over one another, squealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing one another like children, they ran into the street.
<p/>If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open the boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one question: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish scuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning, robbery?
<p/>They'd just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for the bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing that people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they rolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.
<p/>Now take careful note. The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they found them! And there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay</b></font>)</div><p/>And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay's hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important piece of circumstantial evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)--although the explanation given by him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously against him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) innocent, especially as they are facts that cannot be denied .
<p/>And do you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will accept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--resting simply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution?
<p/>No, they won't accept it, they certainly won't, because they found the jewel-case and the man tried to hang himself, `which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not have done if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't felt guilty.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is strange! It's impossible, indeed, but...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, brother, no buts . That's the point, that's what excites me, you must understand!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; what proof is there that the box came from the old woman?''
<p/>'' That's been proved,'' said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning. '' Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, who proved conclusively that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>).''
<p/>Did anyone see Nikolay at the time that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no evidence about that?''
<p/>Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way upstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.
<p/>They said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going on in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether there actually were men at work in it.''
<p/>'' That's bad. Now another point. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody did see him (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin answered with vexation. '' That's the worst of it. <div class="bookquote">``Hm!...
<p/>So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating one another and laughing. That constitutes a strong presumption, but...
<p/>How do you explain the facts yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It's clear. At any rate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and the jewel-case points to it.
<p/>Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the murderer popped out and ran down, too; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) had no other way of escape.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) stopped there while the porter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of hearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri and Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry; possibly he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was seen, but not noticed.
<p/>The real murderer dropped those ear-rings. The murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked at the door. There are lots of people going in and out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) must have dropped the ear-rings out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) pocket when he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) stood behind the door, and did not notice he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) dropped them, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) had other things to think of.

<p/>That beats everything.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But, why, why?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, because everything fits too well... it's too melodramatic.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A-ach! ''  (<font color='red'><b>This a gentleman</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER V This was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance, and a cautious and sour countenance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) began by stopping short in the doorway, staring about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with offensive and undisguised astonishment, as though asking himself what sort of place he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had come to.
<p/>With the same amazement he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled, unwashed, on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<p/>Then with the same deliberation he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and unshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) boldly and inquiringly in the face without rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) seat.
<p/>Mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost affronted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) scanned Raskolnikov's low and narrow <div class="bookquote">``cabin. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>A constrained silence lasted for a couple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting took place.
<p/>Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) would get nothing in this <div class="bookquote">``cabin''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>by attempting to overawe them, the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity, emphasising every syllable of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) question, addressed Zossimov:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div>Zossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not Razumihin anticipated him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>).
<p/>'' Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is lying on the sofa! What do you want? '' This familiar <div class="bookquote">``what do you want''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>seemed to cut the ground from the feet of the pompous gentleman.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was turning to Razumihin, but checked himself in time and turned to Zossimov again. '' This is Raskolnikov,'' mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lazily put his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold watch in a round hunter's case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly and lazily proceeded to put it back.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) gave a prolonged yawn, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mouth as wide as possible. Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) back, gazing persistently, though without understanding, at the stranger.
<p/>Now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had just undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack.
<p/>When Zossimov said <div class="bookquote">``This is Raskolnikov''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but weak and breaking, voice articulated: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am Raskolnikov!
<p/>But the new-comer gradually began to arouse his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) attention, then his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wonder, then suspicion and even alarm. What do you want?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The visitor scrutinised him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) and pronounced impressively: <div class="bookquote">``Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my name is not wholly unknown to you?
<p/>But Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed blankly and dreamily at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), making no reply, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heard the name of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Is it possible that you can up to the present have received no information? '' asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted.
<p/>In reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came into Luzhin's face.
<p/>Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) more inquisitively than ever, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment. '' I had presumed and calculated,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) faltered, <div class="bookquote">``that a letter posted more than ten days, if not a fortnight ago...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, why are you standing in the doorway?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Razumihin interrupted suddenly. '' If you've something to say, sit down. Nastasya and you are so crowded.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) chair back from the table, made a little space between the table and his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the visitor to <div class="bookquote">``thread his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) way in.
<p/>The minute was so chosen that it was impossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) way through, hurrying and stumbling.
<p/>Nastasya, make room. Here's a chair, thread your way in!''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor thread</b></font>)</div>'' Reaching the chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) sat down, looking suspiciously at Razumihin.
<p/>Rodya has been ill for the last five days and delirious for three, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) is recovering and has got an appetite.
<p/>'' No need to be nervous,'' the latter blurted out. '' This is his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) doctor, who has just had a look at him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>).
<p/>I am a comrade of Rodya's, like him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), formerly a student, and now I am nursing him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>); so don't you take any notice of us, but go on with your business.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and conversation?''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov. '' N-no
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) has been conscious a long time, since the morning,'' went on Razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature that Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps, because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a student.
<p/>,'' mumbled Zossimov; <div class="bookquote">``you may amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) yawned again. '' '' Your mamma,'' began Luzhin. <div class="bookquote">``Hm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) throat loudly.
<p/>Luzhin looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) inquiringly. '' That's all right, go on. '' Luzhin shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) shoulders. '' Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) neighbourhood.
<p/>On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to elapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully assured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my astonishment...
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I know, I know! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation. '' So you are the fiancé ? I know, and that's enough!
<p/>'' There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch's being offended this time, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) made a violent effort to understand what it all meant.
<p/>Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) answered, began suddenly staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) again with marked curiosity, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had not had a good look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) yet, or as though something new had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pillow on purpose to stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch's whole appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of <div class="bookquote">``fiancé''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>so unceremoniously applied to him (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>).
<p/>In the first place, it was evident, far too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) few days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding, indeed.
<p/>Even his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the agreeable improvement in his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) appearance might have been forgiven in such circumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rôle of fiancé.
<p/>All his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) clothes were fresh from the tailor's and were all right, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate.
<p/>There was a moment's silence. Even the stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) hands.
<p/>The exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale, if only from the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) not wearing them, but carrying them in his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) hand for show.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade, light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch.
<p/>Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr Petrovitch's attire. His (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) very fresh and even handsome face looked younger than his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) forty-five years at all times.
<p/>Even his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) hair, touched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled at a hairdresser's, did not give him (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) a stupid appearance, as curled hair usually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) wedding-day.
<p/>If there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) rather good-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other causes.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides, growing thickly upon his (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) shining, clean-shaven chin. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as before.
<p/>But Mr. Luzhin hardened his (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) heart and seemed to determine to take no notice of their oddities. '' I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) began, again breaking the silence with an effort.
<p/>I have, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention other preoccupations which you may well conjecture.
<p/>'' If I had been aware of your illness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I am expecting your mamma and sister any minute.
<p/>'' Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face showed some excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing followed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went on: ''...
<p/>Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival. '' <div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>asked Raskolnikov weakly. '' Very near here, in Bakaleyev's house.''
<p/>'' That's in Voskresensky,'' put in Razumihin. '' There are two storeys of rooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I've been there.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, rooms... ''  (<font color='red'><b>character</b></font>)</div>``A disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what's more, of doubtful character. Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer people living there.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger in Petersburg myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily.
<p/>And I went there about a scandalous business. It's cheap, though...'' '' However, the two rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time...
<p/>I have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said, addressing Raskolnikov, <div class="bookquote">``and I am having it done up.
<p/>And meanwhile I am myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) who told me of Bakaleyev's house, too...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lebeziatnikov? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something. '' Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes... no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov answered. '' Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) guardian.... A very nice young man and advanced.
<p/>I like to meet young people: one learns new things from them. '' Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all. ''
<p/>How do you mean?'' asked Razumihin. '' In the most serious and essential matters,'' Pyotr Petrovitch replied, as though delighted at the question.
<p/>All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in the provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.
<p/>'' You see, it's ten years since I visited Petersburg. And it's my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the younger generation.
<p/>And I confess I am delighted...'' '' At what?'' '' Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality...
<p/>'' '' That's true,'' Zossimov let drop. <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! There's no practicality. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin flew at him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>). '' Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from heaven.
<p/>Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) said to Pyotr Petrovitch, <div class="bookquote">``and desire for good exists, though it's in a childish form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.
<p/>And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from all practical life. Anyway, there's no practicality. Practicality goes well shod.
<p/>Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes, but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't agree with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident enjoyment. '' If little has been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.
<p/>It's my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been accomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works are circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.
<p/>In a word, we have cut ourselves off irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great thing...''
<p/>Literature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been rooted up and turned into ridicule... '' He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s learnt it by heart to show off!''
<p/>Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``What? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) words; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) received no reply. '' That's all true,'' Zossimov hastened to interpose.
<p/>You must admit,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade of triumph and superciliousness--he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) almost added <div class="bookquote">``young man'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--``that there is an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and economic truth...
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it so?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``A commonplace.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, `love thy neighbour,' what came of it?''
<p/>It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both were left half naked.
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps with excessive haste. '' As a Russian proverb has it, `Catch several hares and you won't catch one.'
<p/>Science now tells us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on self-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly and your coat remains whole.
<p/>Economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare organised too.
<p/>Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to pass my neighbour's getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not from private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general advance.
<p/>The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time reaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it would seem to want very little wit to perceive it...''
<p/>I began this discussion with an object, but I've grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse oneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that, by Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that.
<p/>'' Excuse me, I've very little wit myself,'' Razumihin cut in sharply, <div class="bookquote">``and so let us drop it. You are in a hurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don't blame you
<p/>I only wanted to find out what sort of man you are, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything they touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire.
<p/>, that's quite pardonable. That's enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>'' Excuse me, sir,'' said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessive dignity. '' Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that
<p/>I too... '' '' Oh, my dear sir... how could I? ... Come, that's enough,'' Razumihin concluded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous conversation.
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) mind to take leave in another minute or two.
<p/>I trust our acquaintance,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) said, addressing Raskolnikov, <div class="bookquote">``may, upon your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware, become closer...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Above all, I hope for your return to health... '' Raskolnikov did not even turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head. Pyotr Petrovitch began getting up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) chair.
<p/>'' One of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) customers must have killed her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>),'' Zossimov declared positively. '' Not a doubt of it,'' replied Razumihin. ''
<p/>Porfiry doesn't give his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) opinion, but is examining all who have left pledges with her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) there.'' <div class="bookquote">``Examining them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov asked aloud.
<p/>Koch has given the names of some of them, other names are on the wrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves.''
<p/>'' Yes. What then?'' <div class="bookquote">``Nothing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How does he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) get hold of them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div>asked Zossimov. '' <div class="bookquote">``It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian!
<p/>The boldness of it! The coolness!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That's just what it wasn't!'' interposed Razumihin. '' That's what throws you all off the scent.
<p/>But I maintain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) is not cunning, not practised, and probably this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>) first crime! The supposition that it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn't work.
<p/>Suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) to have been inexperienced, and it's clear that it was only a chance that saved him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>)--and chance may do anything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) took jewels worth ten or twenty roubles, stuffing his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) pockets with them, ransacked the old woman's trunks, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles, besides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest!
<p/>Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) did not foresee obstacles, perhaps! And how did he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) set to work? He (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) did not know how to rob; he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) could only murder.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) first crime, I assure you, his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) first crime; he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) head. And he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) got off more by luck than good counsel!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) was standing, hat and gloves in hand, but before departing he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrases.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I believe? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>Pyotr Petrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) was evidently anxious to make a favourable impression and his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) vanity overcame his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) prudence.
<p/>'' Yes. You've heard of it?'' '' Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood.'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you know the details?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't say that; but another circumstance interests me in the case--the whole question, so to say.
<p/>Not to speak of the fact that crime has been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last five years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere, what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes, too, crime is increasing proportionately.
<p/>In one place one hears of a student's robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of good social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a whole gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one of the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain....
<p/>And if this old woman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher class in society--for peasants don't pawn gold trinkets--how are we to explain this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' There are many economic changes,'' put in Zossimov. '' How are we to explain it? '' Razumihin caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) up.
<p/>'' It might be explained by our inveterate impracticality. '' <div class="bookquote">``How do you mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>lecturer</b></font>)</div>'' What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he (<font color='blue'><b>lecturer</b></font>) was forging notes? '
<p/>Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I want to make haste to get rich too.' I don't remember the exact words, but the upshot was that he (<font color='blue'><b>lecturer</b></font>) wants money for nothing, without waiting or working!
<p/>We've grown used to having everything ready-made, to walking on crutches, to having our food chewed for us. Then the great hour struck,-LSB-*-RSB- and every man showed himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) true colours.
<p/>'' -LSB-*-RSB- The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant. --TRANSLATOR'S NOTE. '' But morality? And so to speak, principles...''
<p/>'' But why do you worry about it?'' Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. '' It's in accordance with your theory!'' '' In accordance with my theory?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and it follows that people may be killed...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Luzhin.
<p/>'' No, that's not so,'' put in Zossimov. Raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing painfully. ''
<p/>There's a measure in all things,'' Luzhin went on superciliously. '' Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to suppose...
<p/>And is it true,'' Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is it true that you told your fiancée ... within an hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>fiancée</b></font>) acceptance, that what pleased you most... was that she (<font color='blue'><b>fiancée</b></font>) was a beggar... because it was better to raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over her (<font color='blue'><b>fiancée</b></font>), and reproach her (<font color='blue'><b>fiancée</b></font>) with your being her (<font color='blue'><b>fiancée</b></font>) benefactor?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pillow and fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) piercing, glittering eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I tell you what.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And indeed... indeed...'' <div class="bookquote">``What? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face. Silence lasted for some seconds. ''
<p/>Why, if ever again... you dare to mention a single word... about my mother... I shall send you flying downstairs!'' ''
<p/>What's the matter with you?'' cried Razumihin. '' So that's how it is?'' Luzhin turned pale and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lip. ''
<p/>Let me tell you, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began deliberately, doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) utmost to restrain himself but breathing hard, <div class="bookquote">``at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed to me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more.
<p/>I could forgive a great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you... never after this...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am not ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>cried Raskolnikov.
<p/>But Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) speech, squeezing between the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) pass.
<p/>Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who had for some time been making signs to him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) to let the sick man alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) went out, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) hat to the level of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) shoulders to avoid crushing it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) stooped to go out of the door.
<p/>'' So much the worse... '' <div class="bookquote">``Go to hell!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And even the curve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) spine was expressive of the horrible insult he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had received.
<p/>'' How could you--how could you! '' Razumihin said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) head in perplexity. <div class="bookquote">``Let me alone--let me alone all of you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><p/>Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy. '' Will you ever leave off tormenting me? I am not afraid of you! I am not afraid of anyone, anyone now!
<p/>Get away from me! I want to be alone, alone, alone!'' <div class="bookquote">``Come along,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div>said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin. '' But we can't leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) like this!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Zossimov repeated insistently, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) went out. Razumihin thought a minute and ran to overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>). '' It might be worse not to obey him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>),'' said Zossimov on the stairs.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) mustn't be irritated. '' '' What's the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)?'' '' If only he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) could get some favourable shock, that's what would do it!
<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was better....

<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) conversation I gather he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is going to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) sister, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had received a letter about it just before his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) illness...''
<p/>But have you noticed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) takes no interest in anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) does not respond to anything except one point on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) seems excited--that's the murder?''
<p/>``Perhaps it's that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, confound the man! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may have upset the case altogether. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Yes, yes,'' Razumihin agreed, <div class="bookquote">``I noticed that, too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is interested, frightened. It gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) a shock on the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was ill in the police office; he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) fainted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me more about that this evening and I'll tell you something afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) interests me very much! In half an hour I'll go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) again....
<p/>There'll be no inflammation though.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks! And I'll wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) through Nastasya... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) still lingered.
<p/>'' Won't you have some tea now? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) asked. '' Later! I am sleepy! Leave me. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.
<p/>But as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) went out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) got up, latched the door, undid the parcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again and began dressing.
<p/>Strange to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) seemed immediately to have become perfectly calm; not a trace of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) recent delirium nor of the panic fear that had haunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) of late.
<p/>CHAPTER VI It was the first moment of a strange sudden calm. His (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was evident in them.
<p/>'' To-day, to-day,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) muttered to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was still weak, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) intense spiritual concentration gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) strength and self-confidence.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had dressed in entirely new clothes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) looked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment's thought put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) hoped, moreover, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) would not fall down in the street. It was twenty-five roubles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) took also all the copper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and glanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), blowing up the landlady's samovar.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) heard nothing. Who would have dreamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) going out, indeed? A minute later he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was in the street. It was nearly eight o'clock, the sun was setting.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) head felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) feverish eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) wasted, pale and yellow face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) did not know and did not think where he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was going, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had one thought only: <div class="bookquote">``that all this must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) would not return home without it, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) would not go on living like that .
<p/>It was as stifling as before, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>How, with what to make an end?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had not an idea about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) did not even want to think of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) drove away thought; thought tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>).
<p/>All he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) knew, all he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) felt was that everything must be changed <div class="bookquote">``one way or another,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) repeated with desperate and immovable self-confidence and determination.
<p/>A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very sentimental song.
<p/>From old habit he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usual walk in the direction of the Hay Market. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood on the pavement in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was dressed up in a crinoline, a mantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very old and shabby.
<p/>In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and coarsened by street singing, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sang in hope of getting a copper from the shop.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) broke off abruptly on a sentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder <div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and both moved on to the next shop.
<p/>Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five copeck piece and put it in the girl's hand. '' Do you like street music?
<p/>I love to hear singing to a street organ,'' said Raskolnikov, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--<div class="bookquote">``I like it on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the passers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet snow is falling straight down, when there's no wind--you know what I mean?--and the street lamps shine through it...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged man standing idly by him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). The man looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), startled and wondering. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger manner</b></font>)</div>muttered the stranger, frightened by the question and Raskolnikov's strange manner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) crossed over to the other side of the street.
<p/>Raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay Market, where the huckster and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) wife had talked with Lizaveta; but they were not there now.
<p/>Recognising the place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) stopped, looked round and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a corn chandler's shop.
<p/>Excuse me... <div class="bookquote">``Isn't there a man who keeps a booth with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife at this corner?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' All sorts of people keep booths here,'' answered the young man, glancing superciliously at Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' What's his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) name?'' <div class="bookquote">``What he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was christened.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you a Zaraïsky man, too? Which province? ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The young man looked at Raskolnikov again.
<p/>'' It's not a province, your excellency, but a district. Graciously forgive me, your excellency!'' <div class="bookquote">``Is that a tavern at the top there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>princesses</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes, it's an eating-house and there's a billiard-room and you'll find princesses there too.... La-la!'' Raskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was a dense crowd of peasants.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) way into the thickest part of it, looking at the faces. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into conversation with people.
<p/>But the peasants took no notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); they were all shouting in groups together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood and thought a little and took a turning to the right in the direction of V.
<p/>Of late he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had often felt drawn to wander about this district, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt depressed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) might feel more so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading from the market-place to Sadovy Street. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walked along, thinking of nothing.
<p/>At that point there is a great block of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses; women were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their indoor clothes.
<p/>Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement, especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in the lower storeys.
<p/>From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.
<p/>A crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the steps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking.
<p/>A drunken soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road, swearing; he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) seemed to be trying to find his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) way somewhere, but had forgotten where.
<p/>One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead drunk was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of women, who were talking in husky voices.
<p/>They were bare-headed and wore cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and some not more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and uproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing frantically, marking time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heels to the sounds of the guitar and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) listened intently, gloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping inquisitively in from the pavement. '' Oh, my handsome soldier Don't beat me for nothing,'' trilled the thin voice of the singer.
<p/>Raskolnikov felt a great desire to make out what he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was singing, as though everything depended on that. '' Shall I go in?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought. '' They are laughing. From drink. Shall I get drunk?'' <div class="bookquote">``Won't you come in? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>one of the women asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) voice was still musical and less thick than the others, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was young and not repulsive--the only one of the group.
<p/>'' Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s pretty,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, drawing himself up and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) smiled, much pleased at the compliment. ''
<p/>You're very nice looking yourself,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said. '' Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thin though!'' observed another woman in a deep bass. '' Have you just come out of a hospital?''
<p/>They're all generals' daughters, it seems, but they have all snub noses,'' interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) face, wearing a loose coat.
<p/>'' '' See how jolly they are.'' <div class="bookquote">``Go along with you!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll go, sweetie!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) darted down into the saloon below.
<p/>Raskolnikov moved on. '' I say, sir,'' the girl shouted after him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' What is it? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hesitated. '' I'll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but now I feel shy.
<p/>Give me six copecks for a drink, there's a nice young man!'' Raskolnikov gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) what came first--fifteen copecks. '' Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!
<p/>'' '' What's your name?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ask for Duclida.''  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>'' Well, that's too much,'' one of the women observed, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head at Duclida.
<p/>'' I don't know how you can ask like that. I believe I should drop with shame... '' Raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a pock-marked wench of thirty, covered with bruises, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) upper lip swollen. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) criticism quietly and earnestly.
<p/>I've read that someone condemned to death says or thinks, an hour before his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) death, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had to live on some high rock, on such a narrow ledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)'d only room to stand, and the ocean, everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die at once!
<p/>'' Where is it,'' thought Raskolnikov. '' Where is it Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!...
<p/>How true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vile is he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) who calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) vile for that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) added a moment later.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) went into another street. '' Bah, the Palais de Cristal! Razumihin was just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But what on earth was it
<p/>I wanted? Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'d read it in the papers. Have you the papers? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) asked, going into a very spacious and positively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were, however, rather empty.
<p/>Two or three people were drinking tea, and in a room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne. Raskolnikov fancied that Zametov was one of them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not be sure at that distance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last five days, and I'll give you something.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What if it is? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought. '' Will you have vodka?'' asked the waiter. '' '' Yes, sir, here's to-day's.
<p/>No vodka? '' The old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskolnikov sat down and began to look through them. ''
<p/>An accident on a staircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire in Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in the Petersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter
<p/>Oh, damn... these are the items of intelligence. .... Ah, here it is!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) found at last what he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) was seeking and began to read it.
<p/>The lines danced before his (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) eyes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) read it all and began eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>shopkeeper</b></font>) looked up, it was the head clerk Zametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) fingers and the watch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the smart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) hands shook with nervous impatience as he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) turned the sheets. Suddenly someone sat down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) was in a good humour, at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) dark face was rather flushed from the champagne he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) had drunk. '' What, you here?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) began in surprise, speaking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>)'d known him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) life.
<p/>'' Why, Razumihin told me only yesterday you were unconscious. How strange! And do you know I've been to see you?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would come up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) laid aside the papers and turned to Zametov. There was a smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) lips, and a new shade of irritable impatience was apparent in that smile.
<p/>'' I know you have,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) answered. '' I've heard it. You looked for my sock.... And you know Razumihin has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) heart to you?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) says you've been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) to Luise Ivanovna's--you know, the woman you tried to befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) would not understand.
<p/>Do you remember? How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) fail to understand--it was quite clear, wasn't it?'' '' What a hot head he (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) is!''
<p/>'' The explosive one?'' '' No, your friend Razumihin. '' <div class="bookquote">``You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the most agreeable places.
<p/>Who's been pouring champagne into you just now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' We've just been... having a drink together.... You talk about pouring it into me!''
<p/>'' By way of a fee! You profit by everything!'' Raskolnikov laughed, <div class="bookquote">``it's all right, my dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder.
<p/>I am not speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that workman of yours said when he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of the old woman...
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``How do you know about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I know more about it than you do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How strange you are....
<p/>I am sure you are still very unwell. You oughtn't to have come out.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, do I seem strange to you?''
<p/>'' Yes. What are you doing, reading the papers?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' There's a lot about the fires. '' '' No, I am not reading about the fires.
<p/>'' Here he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) looked mysteriously at Zametov; his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lips were twisted again in a mocking smile. '' No, I am not reading about the fires,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went on, winking at Zametov.
<p/>'' But confess now, my dear fellow, you're awfully anxious to know what I am reading about?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am not in the least.
<p/>Mayn't I ask a question? Why do you keep on...?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Listen, you are a man of culture and education?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zametov/Mr. Zametov</b></font>)</div>said Zametov with some dignity.
<p/>'' Sixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting and your rings--you are a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what a charming boy!
<p/>'' Here Raskolnikov broke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov's face. The latter drew back, more amazed than offended. ''
<p/>Foo! how strange you are!'' Zametov repeated very seriously. '' I can't help thinking you are still delirious.'' <div class="bookquote">``I am delirious?
<p/>You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I am strange? You find me curious, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, curious. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for?
<p/>See what a lot of papers I've made them bring me. Suspicious, eh?'' '' Well, what is it?'' <div class="bookquote">``You prick up your ears?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean--`prick up my ears'?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to you... no, better 'I confess'...
<p/>No, that's not right either; 'I make a deposition and you take it.' I depose that I was reading, that I was looking and searching....
<p/>I was searching--and came here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the old pawnbroker woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) eyes and paused. '' Zametov looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) steadily, without moving or drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) face away.
<p/>What struck Zametov afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for exactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while.
<p/>'' What if you have been reading about it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) cried at last, perplexed and impatient. '' That's no business of mine!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The same old woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper, not heeding Zametov's explanation, <div class="bookquote">``about whom you were talking in the police-office, you remember, when I fainted.
<p/>What of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Zametov/Mr. Zametov</b></font>)</div>Well, do you understand now?'' '' What do you mean? Understand... what? '' Zametov brought out, almost alarmed.
<p/>Raskolnikov's set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though utterly unable to restrain himself.
<p/>And in one flash he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) recalled with extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch trembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) had a sudden desire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) tongue at them, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!
<p/>You are either mad, or...'' began Zametov, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) broke off, as though stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) mind.
<p/>'' '' Or? Or what? What? Come, tell me!'' <div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zametov/Mr. Zametov</b></font>)</div>said Zametov, getting angry, <div class="bookquote">``it's all nonsense! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Zametov/Mr. Zametov</b></font>)</div>Both were silent.
<p/>After his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became suddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) elbow on the table and leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) seemed to have completely forgotten Zametov. The silence lasted for some time. '' Why don't you drink your tea? It's getting cold,'' said Zametov.
<p/>Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of bread in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember everything and pulled himself together.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Tea? Oh, yes... ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>At the same moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) face resumed its original mocking expression. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) went on drinking tea.
<p/>Only the other day I read in the Moscow News that a whole gang of false coiners had been caught in Moscow.
<p/>'' There have been a great many of these crimes lately,'' said Zametov. '' It was a regular society. They used to forge tickets!''
<p/>'' Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month ago,'' Raskolnikov answered calmly. '' So you consider them criminals?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added, smiling. '' Of course they are criminals. '' <div class="bookquote">``They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, half a hundred people meeting for such an object--what an idea!
<p/>Three would be too many, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in themselves! One has only to blab in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cups and it all collapses.
<p/>Well, let us suppose that these simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the rest of their lives?
<p/>Simpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what a thing to trust to a casual stranger! Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) life!
<p/>And they did not know how to change the notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand roubles, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands trembled.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) counted the first four thousand, but did not count the fifth thousand--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in such a hurry to get the money into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket and run away.
<p/>Better hang oneself at once! Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) roused suspicion. And the whole thing came to a crash through one fool!
<p/>Is it possible?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hands trembled? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Zametov/Mr. Zametov</b></font>)</div>observed Zametov, <div class="bookquote">``yes, that's quite possible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible.
<p/>Sometimes one can't stand things.''  (<font color='red'><b>Zametov/Mr. Zametov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can't stand that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, could you stand it then? No, I couldn't. For the sake of a hundred roubles to face such a terrible experience?
<p/>To go with false notes into a bank where it's their business to spot that sort of thing! No, I should not have the face to do it.
<p/>Would you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov had an intense desire again <div class="bookquote">``to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tongue out. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Shivers kept running down his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) spine.
<p/>This is how I would change the notes: I'd count the first thousand three or four times backwards and forwards, looking at every note
<p/>; I'd count that half-way through and then hold some fifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light again--to see whether it was a good one. '
<p/>I am afraid,' I would say, 'a relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a false note,' and then I'd tell them the whole story.
<p/>And after I began counting the third, `No, excuse me,' I would say, 'I fancy I made a mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.'
<p/>'' I should do it quite differently,'' Raskolnikov began. '' and then I'd set to the second thousand And so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second
<p/>And when I had finished, I'd pick out one from the fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light and ask again, `Change them, please,' and put the clerk into such a stew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would not know how to get rid of me.
<p/>and so on to the end. When I'd finished and had gone out, I'd come back, `No, excuse me,' and ask for some explanation.
<p/>That's how I'd do it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Foo! what terrible things you say!''  (<font color='red'><b>Zametov/Mr. Zametov</b></font>)</div>said Zametov, laughing. '' But all that is only talk.
<p/>I dare say when it came to deeds you'd make a slip. I believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon on himself, much less you and I.
<p/>The murderer seems to have been a desperate fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) risked everything in open daylight, was saved by a miracle--but his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hands shook, too.
<p/>To take an example near home--that old woman murdered in our district. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did not succeed in robbing the place, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) couldn't stand it.
<p/>That was clear from the... '' Raskolnikov seemed offended. '' Clear? Why don't you catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) then? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cried, maliciously gibing at Zametov.
<p/>'' Well, they will catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``Who? You? Do you suppose you could catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)? You've a tough job! A great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no money and suddenly begins spending, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be the man. So that any child can mislead you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>A man</b></font>)</div><p/>A man will commit a clever murder at the risk of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life and then at once he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes drinking in a tavern.
<p/>'' The fact is they always do that, though,'' answered Zametov. '' They are caught spending money, they are not all as cunning as you are.
<p/>You wouldn't go to a tavern, of course? '' Raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov. '' You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should behave in that case, too?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked with displeasure. '' I should like to,'' Zametov answered firmly and seriously. Somewhat too much earnestness began to appear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) words and looks.
<p/>This is how I should behave,'' Raskolnikov began, again bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face close to Zametov's, again staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) and speaking in a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered.
<p/>I should have taken the money and jewels, I should have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden or place of that sort.
<p/>I should have looked out beforehand some stone weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from the time the house was built.
<p/>I would lift that stone--there would sure to be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that hole.
<p/>Then I'd roll the stone back so that it would look as before, would press it down with my foot and walk away.
<p/>'' Very much?'' <div class="bookquote">``Very much!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' All right then. '' This is what I should have done. And for a year or two, three maybe, I would not touch it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a madman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zametov/Mr. Zametov</b></font>)</div>said Zametov, and for some reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) too spoke in a whisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering.
<p/>And, well, they could search! There'd be no trace. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had turned fearfully pale and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) upper lip was twitching and quivering.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) lips began to move without uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) was doing, but could not restrain himself.
<p/>The terrible word trembled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break out, in another moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) will let it go, he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) will speak out.
<p/>'' And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) said suddenly and--realised what he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) had done.
<p/>Zametov looked wildly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) and turned white as the tablecloth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) face wore a contorted smile. '' But is it possible?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) brought out faintly.
<p/>Raskolnikov looked wrathfully at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zametov/Mr. Zametov</b></font>)</div>Zametov cried hastily.
<p/>'' I've caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it before, if now you believe less than ever?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zametov/Mr. Zametov</b></font>)</div>cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed.
<p/>'' Have you been frightening me so as to lead up to this?'' '' You don't believe it then? What were you talking about behind my back when I went out of the police-office?
<p/>And why did the explosive lieutenant question me after I fainted? Hey, there,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) shouted to the waiter, getting up and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) cap, <div class="bookquote">``how much?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty copecks,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the latter replied, running up. '' And there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot of money!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. '' Red notes and blue, twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them?
<p/>And where did my new clothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. You've cross-examined my landlady, I'll be bound....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical sensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture.
<p/>Well, that's enough! Assez causé! Till we meet again!'' Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) was gloomy and terribly tired. His (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) face was twisted as after a fit.
<p/>Any shock, any irritating sensation stimulated and revived his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) energies at once, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) strength failed as quickly when the stimulus was removed.
<p/>Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) brain on a certain point and had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) conclusively.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fatigue increased rapidly. Zametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in thought. '' Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) decided.
<p/>Raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stumbled against Razumihin on the steps. They did not see each other till they almost knocked against each other.
<p/>For a moment they stood looking each other up and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, then anger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' So here you are!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) shouted at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) voice--<div class="bookquote">``you ran away from your bed! And here I've been looking for you under the sofa!
<p/>We went up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on your account. And here he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is after all. Rodya! What is the meaning of it?
<p/>Tell me the whole truth! Confess! Do you hear?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It means that I'm sick to death of you all and I want to be alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov answered calmly.
<p/>When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a sheet and you are gasping for breath!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alone? Idiot!... What have you been doing in the Palais de Cristal? Own up at once!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let me go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>This was too much for Razumihin; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) gripped him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) firmly by the shoulder. '' Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go?
<p/>Do you know what I'll do with you directly? I'll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you home under my arm and lock you up!''
<p/>A strange desire you have to shower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden in fact!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen, Razumihin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--<div class="bookquote">``can't you see that I don't want your benevolence? Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness?
<p/>Maybe I was very glad to die. Didn't I tell you plainly enough to-day that you were torturing me, that I was... sick of you!
<p/>You seem to want to torture people! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my recovery, because it's continually irritating me.
<p/>You saw Zossimov went away just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, for goodness' sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force?
<p/>Don't you see that I am in possession of all my faculties now? How, how can I persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness?
<p/>I may be ungrateful, I may be mean, only let me be, for God's sake, let me be! Let me be, let me be!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was about to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been with Luzhin.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Razumihin stood a moment, thought and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) hand drop. '' Well, go to hell then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) said gently and thoughtfully.
<p/>'' Stay,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) roared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. <div class="bookquote">``Listen to me. Let me tell you, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots!
<p/>If you've any little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg. And you are plagiarists even in that!
<p/>There isn't a sign of independent life in you! You are made of spermaceti ointment and you've lymph in your veins instead of blood.
<p/>I don't believe in anyone of you! In any circumstances the first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being!
<p/>Stop! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making a movement--<div class="bookquote">``hear me out! You know I'm having a house-warming this evening
<p/>And if you weren't a fool, a common fool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation... you see, Rodya, I recognise you're a clever fellow, but you're a fool!--and if you weren't a fool you'd come round to me this evening instead of wearing out your boots in the street!
<p/>, I dare say they've arrived by now, but I left my uncle there--I just ran in--to receive the guests. Since you have gone out, there's no help for it!
<p/>I'd give you a snug easy chair, my landlady has one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa--any way you would be with us....

<p/>You can't answer for yourself! You don't know anything about it.... Thousands of times I've fought tooth and nail with people and run back to them afterwards....

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov turned and walked away. '' I bet you will,'' Razumihin shouted after him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>). '' I refuse to know you if you don't!
<p/>Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>)?''

<p/>Potchinkov's house, 47, Babushkin's flat, remember!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street. Razumihin looked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) thoughtfully.
<p/>Then with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) went into the house but stopped short of the stairs. '' Confound it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) went on almost aloud.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) talked sensibly but yet... I am a fool! As if madmen didn't talk sensibly! And this was just what Zossimov seemed afraid of.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) forehead. '' What if... how could I let him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) go off alone? He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) may drown himself....
<p/>Ach, what a blunder! I can't. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but there was no trace of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Raskolnikov walked straight to X-- Bridge, stood in the middle, and leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance.
<p/>With a curse he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) returned with rapid steps to the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov. On parting with Razumihin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) felt so much weaker that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) could scarcely reach this place.
<p/>Bending over the water, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the sunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at one distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in the last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal, and the water seemed to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) attention.
<p/>At last red circles flashed before his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal banks, the carriages, all danced before his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) started, saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) became aware of someone standing on the right side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) looked and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, with a long, yellow, wasted face and red sunken eyes.
<p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right hand on the parapet, lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right leg over the railing, then her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left and threw herself into the canal.
<p/>The filthy water parted and swallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning woman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head and legs in the water, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) skirt inflated like a balloon over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back.
<p/>A woman drowning!'' shouted dozens of voices; people ran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people crowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was looking straight at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), but obviously she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw nothing and recognised no one. '' A woman drowning! '' Mercy on it!
<p/>it's our Afrosinya! '' a woman cried tearfully close by. '' Mercy! save her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! kind people, pull her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out!'' <div class="bookquote">``A boat, a boat''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was shouted in the crowd.
<p/>But there was no need of a boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) great coat and his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) boots and rushed into the water.
<p/>It was easy to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) caught hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clothes with his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) right hand and with his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) left seized a pole which a comrade held out to him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>); the drowning woman was pulled out at once.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soon recovered consciousness, raised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing, stupidly wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wet dress with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands.
<p/>They laid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on the granite pavement of the embankment. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said nothing. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s drunk herself out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) senses,'' the same woman's voice wailed at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side.
<p/>I ran out to the shop just now, left my little girl to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--and here she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s in trouble again!
<p/>'' Out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) senses. The other day she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tried to hang herself, we cut her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) down. A neighbour, gentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end, see yonder...
<p/>'' The crowd broke up. The police still remained round the woman, someone mentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange sensation of indifference and apathy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt disgusted. '' No, that's loathsome... water... it's not good enough,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) muttered to himself. '' Nothing will come of it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``no use to wait.
<p/>What about the police office...? And why isn't Zametov at the police office? The police office is open till ten o'clock...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) back to the railing and looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>). '' Very well then!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) said resolutely; he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) moved from the bridge and walked in the direction of the police office.
<p/>Even his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) depression had passed, there was not a trace now of the energy with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) had set out <div class="bookquote">``to make an end of it all.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) heart felt hollow and empty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) did not want to think. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Complete apathy had succeeded to it. '' Well, it's a way out of it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) thought, walking slowly and listlessly along the canal bank.
<p/>'' Anyway I'll make an end, for I want to.... But is it a way out? What does it matter! There'll be the square yard of space--ha!
<p/>But what an end! Is it really the end? Shall I tell them or not? Ah... damn! How tired I am!
<p/>If I could find somewhere to sit or lie down soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid.
<p/>But I don't care about that either! What idiotic ideas come into one's head. '' To reach the police office he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had to go straight forward and take the second turning to the left.
<p/>But at the first turning he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stopped and, after a minute's thought, turned into a side street and went two streets out of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) way, possibly without any object, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) walked, looking at the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ear; he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head and saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was standing at the very gate of the house.
<p/>It was only a few paces away. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had not passed it, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had not been near it since that evening.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went into the house, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stopped at each landing and looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with curiosity; on the first landing the framework of the window had been taken out.
<p/>An overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) on. The narrow, steep staircase was very dark. '' That wasn't so then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thought.
<p/>Here was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been working. '' It's shut up and the door newly painted.
<p/>So it's to let. '' Then the third storey and the fourth. <div class="bookquote">``Here!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was perplexed to find the door of the flat wide open.
<p/>There were men there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) could hear voices; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had not expected that. After brief hesitation he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) mounted the last stairs and went into the flat.
<p/>This seemed to amaze him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) somehow fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) would find everything as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) left it, even perhaps the corpses in the same places on the floor.
<p/>It, too, was being done up; there were workmen in it. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed strange. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill.
<p/>They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with lilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one.
<p/>There were two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the other. Raskolnikov for some reason felt horribly annoyed by this.
<p/>The workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked at the new paper with dislike, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt sorry to have it all so changed. They took no notice of Raskolnikov's coming in; they were talking.
<p/>Raskolnikov folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) arms and listened. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) comes to me in the morning,'' said the elder to the younger, <div class="bookquote">``very early, all dressed up. '
<p/>Why are you preening and prinking?' says I. 'I am ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!' That's a way of going on!
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) dressed up like a regular fashion book!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' And what is a fashion book? '' the younger one asked.
<p/>A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to the tailors here every Saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks how to dress, the male sex as well as the female.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) obviously regarded the other as an authority. '' They're pictures. The gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies' fluffles, they're beyond anything you can fancy.''
<p/>'' There's nothing you can't find in Petersburg,'' the younger cried enthusiastically, <div class="bookquote">``except father and mother, there's everything!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Except them, there's everything to be found, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>the elder declared sententiously.
<p/>Raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box, the bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) very tiny without furniture in it.
<p/>The paper was the same; the paper in the corner showed where the case of ikons had stood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked at it and went to the window.
<p/>The elder workman looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) askance. '' What do you want? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) asked suddenly. Instead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the bell.
<p/>The same bell, the same cracked note. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) rang it a second and a third time; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) listened and remembered. The hideous and agonisingly fearful sensation he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had felt then began to come back more and more vividly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shuddered at every ring and it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) more and more satisfaction. '' Well, what do you want? Who are you?
<p/>'' the workman shouted, going out to him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>). Raskolnikov went inside again. '' I want to take a flat,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I am looking round.'' '' It's not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought to come up with the porter.''
<p/>'' The floors have been washed, will they be painted?'' Raskolnikov went on. '' Is there no blood?'' '' What blood?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, the old woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister were murdered here. There was a perfect pool there.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But who are you?
<p/>'' the workman cried, uneasy. '' Who am I?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' You want to know? Come to the police station, I'll tell you.
<p/>'' The workmen looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) in amazement. '' It's time for us to go, we are late. Come along, Alyoshka.
<p/>We must lock up,'' said the elder workman. '' Very well, come along,'' said Raskolnikov indifferently, and going out first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went slowly downstairs.
<p/>At the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by; the two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.
<p/>'' Hey, porter,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) cried in the gateway. Raskolnikov went straight up to them. '' What do you want? '' asked one of the porters.
<p/>'' Have you been to the police office?'' '' I've just been there. What do you want?'' <div class="bookquote">``Is it open?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is the assistant there?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) was there for a time. What do you want? '' Raskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'s been to look at the flat,'' said the elder workman, coming forward. '' Which flat? '' <div class="bookquote">``Where we are at work. '
<p/>Why have you washed away the blood?' says he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>). ' There has been a murder here,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>), `and I've come to take it.'
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) began ringing at the bell, all but broke it. ' Come to the police station,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>). ' I'll tell you everything there.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) wouldn't leave us. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The porter</b></font>)</div>The porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed. '' Who are you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shouted as impressively as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could.
<p/>I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live in Shil's house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) knows me.
<p/>'' '' Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not turning round, but looking intently into the darkening street.
<p/>'' Why have you been to the flat?'' '' To look at it. '' '' What is there to look at?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) straight to the police station,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man in the long coat jerked in abruptly. Raskolnikov looked intently at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) over his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shoulder and said in the same slow, lazy tones: <div class="bookquote">``Come along.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, take him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man went on more confidently. '' Why was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) going into that , what's in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, eh?''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not drunk, but God knows what's the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),'' muttered the workman. '' But what do you want?
<p/>'' the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry in earnest--<div class="bookquote">``Why are you hanging about?''  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You funk the police station then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>said Raskolnikov jeeringly.
<p/>'' How funk it? Why are you hanging about?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'s a rogue!'' shouted the peasant woman. '' Why waste time talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)?
<p/>'' cried the other porter, a huge peasant in a full open coat and with keys on his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) belt. <div class="bookquote">``Get along!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) is a rogue and no mistake. Get along!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>And seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) into the street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lurched forward, but recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) footing, looked at the spectators in silence and walked away. '' Strange man!'' observed the workman.
<p/>'' There are strange folks about nowadays,'' said the woman. '' You should have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) to the police station all the same,'' said the man in the long coat.
<p/>'' Better have nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),'' decided the big porter. '' A regular rogue! Just what he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) wants, you may be sure, but once take him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) up, you won't get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>)...
<p/>'' thought Raskolnikov, standing in the middle of the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), as though expecting from someone a decisive word.
<p/>But no sound came, all was dead and silent like the stones on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walked, dead to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) alone....
<p/>All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards away, in the gathering dusk he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.
<p/>We know the sort!'' '' Shall I go there or not? In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in the middle of the street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) seemed to clutch at everything and smiled coldly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) recognised it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had fully made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind to go to the police station and knew that it would all soon be over.
<p/>An elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got off his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle...
<p/>'' What is it? '' Raskolnikov turned to the right and went up to the crowd. CHAPTER VII A mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front.
<p/>One of them held a lighted lantern which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was turning on something lying close to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating: <div class="bookquote">``What a misfortune!
<p/>Raskolnikov pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) way in as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could, and succeeded at last in seeing the object of the commotion and interest.
<p/>On the ground a man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with blood; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very badly dressed, but not like a workman.
<p/>Good Lord, what a misfortune!''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>Blood was flowing from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and face; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was crushed, mutilated and disfigured. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was evidently badly injured.
<p/>'' Merciful heaven!'' wailed the coachman, <div class="bookquote">``what more could I do? If I'd been driving fast or had not shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but I was going quietly, not in a hurry.
<p/>Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody else. A drunken man can't walk straight, we all know.... I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crossing the street, staggering and almost falling.
<p/>I shouted again and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell straight under their feet!
<p/>Either he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did it on purpose or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very tipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) screamed... that made them worse.
<p/>That's how it happened!''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>'' That's just how it was,'' a voice in the crowd confirmed. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouted, that's true, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouted three times,'' another voice declared.
<p/>'' Three times it was, we all heard it,'' shouted a third. But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened.
<p/>It was evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little anxiety to avoid upsetting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrangements.
<p/>All they had to do was to take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name.
<p/>Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). The lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' I know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! I know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouted, pushing to the front. '' It's a government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) lives close by in Kozel's house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pulled money out of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pocket and showed it to the policeman.
<p/>Raskolnikov gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) besought the police to carry the unconscious Marmeladov to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) lodging at once.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) was in violent agitation. The police were glad that they had found out who the man was. '' Just here, three houses away,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said eagerly, <div class="bookquote">``the house belongs to Kozel, a rich German.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a drunkard. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a family there, a wife, children, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has one daughter....
<p/>It will take time to take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the hospital, and there is sure to be a doctor in the house.
<p/>I'll pay, I'll pay! At least he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) will be looked after at home... they will help him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) at once. But he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'ll die before you get him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to the hospital.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) managed to slip something unseen into the policeman's hand. But the thing was straightforward and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here.
<p/>They raised the injured man; people volunteered to help. Kozel's house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind, carefully holding Marmeladov's head and showing the way.
<p/>'' This way, this way! We must take him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) upstairs head foremost. Turn round! I'll pay, I'll make it worth your while,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) muttered.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) always did at every free moment, walking to and fro in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) little room from window to stove and back again, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) arms folded across her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) chest, talking to herself and coughing.
<p/>Of late she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had begun to talk more than ever to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eldest girl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) did not understand, understood very well that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mother needed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), and so always watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) big clever eyes and strove her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) utmost to appear to understand.
<p/>This time Polenka was undressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) little brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) to take off his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shirt, which had to be washed at night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent, serious face, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) legs stretched out straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--heels together and toes turned out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was listening to what his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother was saying to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sister, sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed.
<p/>The door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor, consumptive woman.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic flush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face was brighter than ever.
<p/>You wouldn't believe, you can't imagine, Polenka,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said, walking about the room, <div class="bookquote">``what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa's house and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!
<p/>Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that everyone who came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) said, `We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch, as our governor!'
<p/>A little girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen, waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turn. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When I... when...
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) coughed violently, <div class="bookquote">``oh, cursed life,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cried, clearing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) throat and pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) breast, <div class="bookquote">``when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal's...

<p/>Oh, dear! -LRB-Cough, cough, cough, cough!-RRB- Again! What's this? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men, who were pushing into her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) room, carrying a burden.
<p/>'' What is it? What are they bringing? Mercy on us!'' <div class="bookquote">``Where are we to put him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?

<p/>'' On the sofa! Put him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) straight on the sofa, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) head this way,'' Raskolnikov showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' Run over in the road!
<p/>Drunk! '' someone shouted in the passage. Katerina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath. The children were terrified. Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and clutched at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), trembling all over.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) said, speaking quickly, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don't be frightened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) will come to, I told them bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) here...
<p/>Having laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For God's sake be calm, don't be frightened! '' I've been here already, you remember?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) will come to; I'll pay!'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'s done it this time!'' Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) rushed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) husband.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) instantly placed under the luckless man's head a pillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) head, forgetting herself, biting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) trembling lips and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>Raskolnikov noticed at once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was not one of those women who swoon easily. Raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor.
<p/>There was a doctor, it appeared, next door but one. '' I've sent for a doctor,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, <div class="bookquote">``don't be uneasy, I'll pay.
<p/>Haven't you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel, anything, as quick as you can.... He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is injured, but not killed, believe me....
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the corner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in readiness for washing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) children's and husband's linen that night.
<p/>We shall see what the doctor says!''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>This washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a week, if not oftener.
<p/>For the family had come to such a pass that they were practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could not endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) preferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) strength when the rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry by the morning.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov's request, but almost fell down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) burden. But the latter had already succeeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off Marmeladov's face.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) breast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was in need of attention herself. Raskolnikov began to realise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) might have made a mistake in having the injured man brought here.
<p/>If you don't find her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) at home, leave word that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) father has been run over and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is to come here at once... when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) comes in.
<p/>The policeman, too, stood in hesitation. '' Polenka,'' cried Katerina Ivanovna, <div class="bookquote">``run to Sonia, make haste. Run, Polenka! there, put on the shawl.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heels thrust forward and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) toes spread out.
<p/>The policemen left, all except one, who remained for a time, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs.
<p/>Almost all Madame Lippevechsel's lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms of the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but afterwards they overflowed into the room.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Run your fastest! Meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn't have dropped a pin. Katerina Ivanovna flew into a fury.
<p/>You might let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) die in peace, at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) shouted at the crowd, <div class="bookquote">``is it a spectacle for you to gape at?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With cigarettes! -LRB-Cough, cough, cough!-RRB- You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hat!...
<p/>Get away! You should respect the dead, at least!'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cough choked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) reproaches were not without result. They evidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna.
<p/>The lodgers, one after another, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden accident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which no living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and compassion.
<p/>Voices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying that they'd no business to make a disturbance here. ''
<p/>No business to die!'' cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was rushing to the door to vent her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to face with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident and ran in to restore order.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was a particularly quarrelsome and irresponsible German. '' Ah, my God!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cried, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hands, ``your husband drunken horses have trampled!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) always took a haughty tone with the landlady that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) might <div class="bookquote">``remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) place''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and even now could not deny herself this satisfaction-RRB-.

<p/>You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) at least die in peace! Or I warn you the Governor-General, himself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow.
<p/>Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many friends and protectors, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor-General</b></font>) abandoned himself from an honourable pride, knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor-General</b></font>) unhappy weakness, but now -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Ludwigovna</b></font>) pointed to Raskolnikov-RRB- a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has wealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a child.
<p/>The prince knew me as a girl; he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been a benefactor to him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>). You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna...
<p/>'' All this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker, but a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna's eloquence.
<p/>At that instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The injured man opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes and without recognition or understanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) drew deep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mouth and drops of perspiration came out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>Not recognising Raskolnikov, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' My God! His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) whole chest is crushed! How he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is bleeding,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said in despair. '' We must take off his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) clothes.
<p/>Turn a little, Semyon Zaharovitch, if you can,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cried to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Marmeladov recognised her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). '' A priest,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) articulated huskily.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) head against the window frame and exclaimed in despair: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, cursed life! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A priest,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the dying man said again after a moment's silence.
<p/>'' They've gone for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),'' Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) shout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) returned and stood by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pillow.
<p/>Soon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes rested on little Lida, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favourite, who was shaking in the corner, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) were in a fit, and staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) wondering childish eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed a little easier but not for long. '' A-ah,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) signed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) uneasily. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to say something.
<p/>'' What now?'' cried Katerina Ivanovna. '' Barefoot, barefoot! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the child's bare feet. ''
<p/>The doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistrustfully; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went up to the sick man, took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pulse, carefully felt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unbuttoned the blood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man's chest.
<p/>Be silent,'' Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, <div class="bookquote">``you know why she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is barefooted.''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank God, the doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved. It was gashed, crushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.
<p/>On the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking yellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horse's hoof. The doctor frowned.
<p/>The policeman told him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) was caught in the wheel and turned round with it for thirty yards on the road.
<p/>'' It's wonderful that he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) has recovered consciousness,'' the doctor whispered softly to Raskolnikov. '' What do you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) will die immediately.'' <div class="bookquote">``Is there really no hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not the faintest! He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is at the last gasp....
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head is badly injured, too... Hm... I could bleed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) if you like, but... it would be useless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes.
<p/>At that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted, and the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing the sacrament.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Better bleed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' If you like.... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless. '' A policeman had gone for him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) at the time of the accident.
<p/>The doctor changed places with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), exchanging glances with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). Raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shoulders and remained.
<p/>All stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probably understood little; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could only utter indistinct broken sounds.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little bare knees, lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand rhythmically, crossing himself with precision and bowed down, touching the floor with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forehead, which seemed to afford him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) especial satisfaction.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) lips and held back her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) tears; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) prayed, too, now and then pulling straight the boy's shirt, and managed to cover the girl's bare shoulders with a kerchief, which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took from the chest without rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees or ceasing to pray.
<p/>In the passage the crowd of spectators from all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not venture beyond the threshold.
<p/>Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was opened inquisitively again. A single candle-end lighted up the scene. At that moment Polenka forced her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way through the crowd at the door.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came in panting from running so fast, took off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kerchief, looked for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s coming, I met her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the street.
<p/>Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way through the crowd, and strange was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags, death and despair.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), too, was in rags, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attire was all of the cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp, unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kneel beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Sonia stopped short in the doorway and looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) bewildered, unconscious of everything.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with its ridiculous long train, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) immense crinoline that filled up the whole doorway, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat with its flaring flame-coloured feather.
<p/>Under this rakishly-tilted hat was a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in terror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather pretty, with wonderful blue eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked intently at the bed and the priest; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some words in the crowd probably, reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked down and took a step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door. The service was over.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) husband again. The priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and consolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.
<p/>'' What am I to do with these? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) interrupted sharply and irritably, pointing to the little ones. '' God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour,'' the priest began.
<p/>'' Ach! He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is merciful, but not to us.'' '' That's a sin, a sin, madam,'' observed the priest, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) head.
<p/>Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to compensate you, at least for the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) earnings.''
<p/>'' And isn't that a sin?'' cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying man. '' <div class="bookquote">``You don't understand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' And why should they compensate me? Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was drunk and threw himself under the horses! What earnings? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought us in nothing but misery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drank everything away, the drunkard! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) robbed us to get drink, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s dying!
<p/>One less to keep!'' <div class="bookquote">``You must forgive in the hour of death, that's a sin, madam, such feelings are a great sin.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was giving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) water, wiping the blood and sweat from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pillow straight, and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) flew at him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) almost in a frenzy. '' Ah, father!

<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been sousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rags and the children's and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight
<p/>I should have been darning them. That's how I spend my nights!... What's the use of talking of forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) other hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) aching chest.
<p/>A terrible hollow cough interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) words. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) head and said nothing.
<p/>Marmeladov was in the last agony; he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) did not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) eyes off the face of Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) kept trying to say something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) began moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) tongue with difficulty and articulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) wanted to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) forgiveness, called peremptorily to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Be silent!

<p/>'' Who's that? Who's that? <div class="bookquote">``Lie down! Lie do-own! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>cried Katerina Ivanovna. With unnatural strength he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had succeeded in propping himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter, as though not recognising her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) before in such attire.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognised her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), crushed and ashamed in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) humiliation and gaudy finery, meekly awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) turn to say good-bye to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) dying father.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cried, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tried to hold out his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), but losing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) balance, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fell off the sofa, face downwards on the floor.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face showed intense suffering. '' Sonia! Daughter! Forgive! '' They rushed to pick him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up, they put him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on the sofa; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was dying.
<p/>Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and remained so without moving. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) died in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) arms. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s got what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wanted,'' Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) husband's dead body.
<p/>'' Well, what's to be done now? How am I to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)! What can I give them to-morrow to eat?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna. '' Katerina Ivanovna,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``last week your husband told me all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life and circumstances....
<p/>From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was to you all and how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became friends....
<p/>Believe me, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spoke of you with passionate reverence. Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my dead friend.
<p/>Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of any assistance to you, then... I... in short, I will come again, I will be sure to come again...
<p/>I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow.... Good-bye! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went quickly out of the room, squeezing his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) way through the crowd to the stairs.
<p/>But in the crowd he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) suddenly jostled against Nikodim Fomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions in person.
<p/>They had not met since the scene at the police station, but Nikodim Fomitch knew him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) instantly. '' Ah, is that you?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). '' He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s dead,'' answered Raskolnikov. '' The doctor and the priest have been, all as it should have been.
<p/>Don't worry the poor woman too much, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is in consumption as it is. Try and cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up, if possible...
<p/>you are a kind-hearted man, I know...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added with a smile, looking straight in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. '' But you are spattered with blood,'' observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticing in the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikov's waistcoat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly within him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>'' Yes... I'm covered with blood,'' Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) smiled, nodded and went downstairs. This sensation might be compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been pardoned.
<p/>Halfway down the staircase he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was overtaken by the priest on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way home; Raskolnikov let him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pass, exchanging a silent greeting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was just descending the last steps when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heard rapid footsteps behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). Someone overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); it was Polenka. She (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was running after him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), calling <div class="bookquote">``Wait! wait!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned round. She (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped short a step above him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). A dim light came in from the yard.
<p/>Raskolnikov could distinguish the child's thin but pretty little face, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with a bright childish smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had run after him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with a message which she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was evidently glad to give.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, what is your name?... and where do you live? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said hurriedly in a breathless voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) laid both hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shoulders and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with a sort of rapture.
<p/>It was such a joy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not have said why. '' Who sent you?''
<p/>'' Sister Sonia sent me,'' answered the girl, smiling still more brightly. '' I knew it was sister Sonia sent you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up, too, and said `Run fast, Polenka.'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you love sister Sonia?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) more than anyone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Polenka</b></font>)</div>Polenka answered with a peculiar earnestness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) smile became graver. '' And will you love me?
<p/>By way of answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) saw the little girl's face approaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) full lips naïvely held out to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>).
<p/>'' Suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms as thin as sticks held him (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) tightly , her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head rested on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) shoulder and the little girl wept softly, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face against him (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>).
<p/>I am sorry for father,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said a moment later, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands.
<p/>It's nothing but misfortunes now,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) added suddenly with that peculiarly sedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak like grown-up people.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) loved Lida most,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went on very seriously without a smile, exactly like grown-up people, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is little and because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is ill, too.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>'' '' Did your father love you?'' '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always used to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) presents. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) added with dignity.
<p/>'' And mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) liked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach me French, for it's time my education began.''
<p/>I say my prayers to myself as I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.
<p/>First they repeat the `Ave Maria' and then another prayer: `Lord, forgive and bless sister Sonia,' and then another, `Lord, forgive and bless our second father.'
<p/>'' And do you know your prayers?'' <div class="bookquote">``Of course, we do! We knew them long ago. For our elder father is dead and this is another one, but we do pray for the other as well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll pray for you all the rest of my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the little girl declared hotly, and suddenly smiling again she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rushed at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) warmly once more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Polenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, too. ' And Thy servant Rodion,' nothing more.''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) name and address and promised to be sure to come next day.
<p/>The child went away quite enchanted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). It was past ten when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) came out into the street. In five minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was standing on the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.
<p/>'' Enough,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. '' I've done with fancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! Life is real! haven't I lived just now?
<p/>My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom of Heaven to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--and now enough, madam, leave me in peace!
<p/>Now for the reign of reason and light... and of will, and of strength... and now we will see! We will try our strength!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added defiantly, as though challenging some power of darkness. '' And I was ready to consent to live in a square of space!
<p/>'' I am very weak at this moment, but... I believe my illness is all over. I knew it would be over when I went out.
<p/>By the way, Potchinkov's house is only a few steps away. I certainly must go to Razumihin even if it were not close by... let him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) win his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) bet!
<p/>Strength, strength is what one wants, you can get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--that's what they don't know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added proudly and self-confidently
<p/>Let us give him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) some satisfaction, too--no matter! and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. Pride and self-confidence grew continually stronger in him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was becoming a different man every moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not know himself; like a man catching at a straw, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suddenly felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), too, `could live, that there was still life for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) life had not died with the old woman.'
<p/>What was it had happened to work this revolution in him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)? Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was in too great a hurry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) conclusions, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not think of that.
<p/>'' But I did ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to remember `Thy servant Rodion' in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) prayers,'' the idea struck him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). '' Well, that was... in case of emergency,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) added and laughed himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) boyish sally.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at Potchinkov's and the porter at once showed him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) the way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was in the best of spirits. Half-way upstairs he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big gathering of people.
<p/>The door was wide open on the stairs; he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) could hear exclamations and discussion. Razumihin's room was fairly large; the company consisted of fifteen people.
<p/>Raskolnikov stopped in the entry, where two of the landlady's servants were busy behind a screen with two samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up from the landlady's kitchen.
<p/>At the first glance it was apparent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had had a great deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite drunk, this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was perceptibly affected by it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov hastened to say, <div class="bookquote">``I've only just come to tell you you've won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) ran out delighted. I can't come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly.
<p/>And so good evening and good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what? I'll see you home. If you say you're weak yourself, you must...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped out?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncle's, I expect, or perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has come without being invited...
<p/>I'll leave uncle with them, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is an invaluable person, pity I can't introduce you to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) now. But confound them all now!
<p/>They won't notice me, and I need a little fresh air, for you've come just in the nick of time--another two minutes
<p/>and I should have come to blows! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff... you simply can't imagine what men will say!
<p/>Though why shouldn't you imagine? Don't we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them... that's the way to learn not to!... Wait a minute, I'll fetch Zossimov.
<p/>You must go to bed at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pronounced, examining the patient as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could, <div class="bookquote">``and take something for the night.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Zossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) showed a special interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); soon his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face brightened. '' Will you take it?
<p/>I got it ready some time ago... a powder.'' '' Two, if you like,'' answered Raskolnikov. The powder was taken at once.
<p/>'' It's a good thing you are taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) home,'' observed Zossimov to Razumihin--<div class="bookquote">``we shall see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is to-morrow, to-day
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'s not at all amiss--a considerable change since the afternoon. Live and learn...''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street. '' I won't tell you everything, brother, because they are such fools.
<p/>Zossimov told me to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and afterwards I am to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) about it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s got a notion in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head that you are... mad or close on it.
<p/>In the first place, you've three times the brains he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has; in the second, if you are not mad, you needn't care a hang that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has got such a wild idea; and thirdly, that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental diseases, and what's brought him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to this conclusion about you was your conversation to-day with Zametov.''
<p/>Only fancy! <div class="bookquote">``Zametov told you all about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) did well. Now I understand what it all means and so does Zametov
<p/>.... Well, the fact is, Rodya ... the point is... I am a little drunk now.... But that's... no matter... the point is that this idea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains...
<p/>That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that bubble's burst and gone for ever.
<p/>I gave Zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--that's between ourselves, brother; please don't let out a hint that you know of it; I've noticed he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna's.
<p/>you understand? But why are they such fools? But to-day, to-day it's all cleared up. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) took advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) is ashamed of it himself now ; I know that...
<p/>'' Raskolnikov listened greedily. Razumihin was drunk enough to talk too freely. '' I fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint,'' said Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' No need to explain that! And it wasn't the paint only: the fever had been coming on for a month; Zossimov testifies to that!
<p/>But how crushed that boy is now, you wouldn't believe! ' I am not worth his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little finger,' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) says. Yours, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) means.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has good feelings at times, brother. But the lesson, the lesson you gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to-day in the Palais de Cristal, that was too good for anything!
<p/>You almost convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then you suddenly--put out your tongue at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>): `There now, what do you make of it?'
<p/>You frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at first, you know, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nearly went into convulsions! It was perfect! He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is crushed, annihilated now! It was masterly, by Jove, it's what they deserve!
<p/>Ah, that I wasn't there! He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was hoping to see you awfully. Porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance... '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>... he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) too... but why did they put me down as mad?''  (<font color='red'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not mad. I must have said too much, brother...
<p/>; now it's clear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances... and how that irritated you and worked in with your illness...
<p/>What struck him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), you see, was that only that subject seemed to interest you I am a little drunk, brother, only, confound him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has some idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own...
<p/>I tell you, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s mad on mental diseases. But don't you mind him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)... ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>For half a minute both were silent.
<p/>'' Listen, Razumihin,'' began Raskolnikov, <div class="bookquote">``I want to tell you plainly: I've just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died...
<p/>I gave them all my money... and besides I've just been kissed by someone who, if I had killed anyone, would just the same...
<p/>in fact I saw someone else there... with a flame-coloured feather... but I am talking nonsense; I am very weak, support me...
<p/>we shall be at the stairs directly... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>'' What's the matter? What's the matter with you? '' Razumihin asked anxiously.
<p/>'' I am a little giddy, but that's not the point, I am so sad, so sad... like a woman. Look, what's that?
<p/>They were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at the level of the landlady's door, and they could, as a fact, see from below that there was a light in Raskolnikov's garret.
<p/>Look, look!'' '' What is it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't you see? A light in my room, you see? Through the crack... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Nastasya</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Queer! Nastasya, perhaps,'' observed Razumihin. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) is never in my room at this time and she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) must be in bed long ago, but...
<p/>I don't care! Good-bye!'' '' What do you mean? I am coming with you, we'll come in together!'' <div class="bookquote">``I know we are going in together, but I want to shake hands here and say good-bye to you here.
<p/>So give me your hand, good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodya</b></font>)</div>'' What's the matter with you, Rodya?'' '' Nothing... come along... you shall be witness.
<p/>'' They began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck Razumihin that perhaps Zossimov might be right after all. '' Ah, I've upset him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) with my chatter!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) muttered to himself. When they reached the door they heard voices in the room. '' What is it?'' cried Razumihin.
<p/>Raskolnikov was the first to open the door; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother and sister were sitting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sofa and had been waiting an hour and a half for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) never expected, never thought of them, though the news that they had started, were on their way and would arrive immediately, had been repeated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) only that day?
<p/>They had spent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was standing before them and had told them everything by now.
<p/>They were beside themselves with alarm when they heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``running away''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>to-day, ill and, as they understood from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) story, delirious! ''
<p/>Good Heavens, what had become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)? '' Both had been weeping, both had been in anguish for that hour and a half.
<p/>A cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov's entrance. Both rushed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) like a thunderbolt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) arms to embrace them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother and sister clasped him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in their arms, kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), laughed and cried.
<p/>Razumihin who was standing in the doorway flew into the room, seized the sick man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strong arms and in a moment had him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the sofa.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took a step, tottered and fell to the ground, fainting. Anxiety, cries of horror, moans... '' It's nothing, nothing! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried to the mother and sister--``it's only a faint, a mere trifle!
<p/>Only just now the doctor said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was much better, that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is perfectly well! Water! See, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is coming to himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is all right again!
<p/>And seizing Dounia by the arm so that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) almost dislocated it, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bend down to see that ``he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is all right again.
<p/>They had heard already from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya during his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) illness, by this <div class="bookquote">``very competent young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria</b></font>)</div>as Pulcheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikov called him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) that evening in conversation with Dounia.
<p/>'' '' The mother and sister looked on him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) with emotion and gratitude, as their Providence. PART III CHAPTER I Raskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand weakly to Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was addressing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother and sister, took them both by the hand and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother was alarmed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) expression. It revealed an emotion agonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almost insane.
<p/>Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry. Avdotya Romanovna was pale; her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand trembled in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother's. <div class="bookquote">``Go home... with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said in a broken voice, pointing to Razumihin, <div class="bookquote">``good-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything...
<p/>Is it long since you arrived?''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>'' This evening, Rodya,'' answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna, <div class="bookquote">``the train was awfully late. But, Rodya, nothing would induce me to leave you now!
<p/>I will spend the night here, near you...''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't torture me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) said with a gesture of irritation. '' I will stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>),'' cried Razumihin, <div class="bookquote">``I won't leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) for a moment.
<p/>Bother all my visitors! Let them rage to their hearts' content! My uncle is presiding there. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How, how can I thank you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div><p/>Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning, once more pressing Razumihin's hands, but Raskolnikov interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) again. '' I can't have it! I can't have it!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>Dounia whispered in dismay; ``we are distressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), that's evident.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) repeated irritably, <div class="bookquote">``don't worry me! Enough, go away... I can't stand it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' Mayn't I look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) after three years?'' wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
<p/>'' Stay,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stopped them again, <div class="bookquote">``you keep interrupting me, and my ideas get muddled.... Have you seen Luzhin?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Rodya, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knows already of our arrival.
<p/>We have heard, Rodya, that Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>Pulcheria Alexandrovna added somewhat timidly. ''
<p/>Yes... he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was so kind... Dounia, I promised Luzhin I'd throw him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) downstairs and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to go to hell... ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rodya, what are you saying! Surely, you don't mean to tell us... ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stopped, looking at Dounia.
<p/>Both of them had heard of the quarrel from Nastasya, so far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had succeeded in understanding and reporting it, and were in painful perplexity and suspense.
<p/>Dounia,'' Raskolnikov continued with an effort, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want that marriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin, so that we may never hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) name again.
<p/>Avdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) brother, waiting for what would come next. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Good Heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
<p/>'' Brother, think what you are saying!'' Avdotya Romanovna began impetuously, but immediately checked herself. '' You are not fit to talk now, perhaps; you are tired,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added gently.
<p/>'' You think I am delirious? No... You are marrying Luzhin for my sake. But I won't accept the sacrifice. And so write a letter before to-morrow, to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>)...
<p/>Let me read it in the morning and that will be the end of it!'' <div class="bookquote">``That I can't do! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl cried, offended, <div class="bookquote">``what right
<p/>have you...''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow... Don't you see... ''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the mother interposed in dismay. '' Better come away!''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) is raving,'' Razumihin cried tipsily, <div class="bookquote">``or how would he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) dare! To-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) certainly did drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) away.
<p/>That was so. And Luzhin got angry, too.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) made speeches here, wanted to show off his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) learning and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) went out crest-fallen...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then it's true?''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. '' Good-bye till to-morrow, brother,'' said Dounia compassionately--<div class="bookquote">``let us go, mother... Good-bye, Rodya. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you hear, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) repeated after them, making a last effort, <div class="bookquote">``I am not delirious; this marriage is--an infamy. Let me act like a scoundrel, but you mustn't...
<p/>one is enough... and though I am a scoundrel, I wouldn't own such a sister. It's me or Luzhin! Go now...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But you're out of your mind! Despot! '' roared Razumihin; but Raskolnikov did not and perhaps could not answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lay down on the sofa, and turned to the wall, utterly exhausted.
<p/>Avdotya Romanovna looked with interest at Razumihin; her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively started at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) glance. Pulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.
<p/>'' Nothing would induce me to go,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) whispered in despair to Razumihin. '' I will stay somewhere here... escort Dounia home.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll spoil everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin answered in the same whisper, losing patience--<div class="bookquote">``come out on to the stairs, anyway. Nastasya, show a light!
<p/>I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) went on in a half whisper on the stairs--<div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon!
<p/>Do you understand? The doctor himself! Even he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) gave way and left him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), so as not to irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). I remained downstairs on guard, but he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) dressed at once and slipped off.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) will slip off again if you irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>), at this time of night, and will do himself some mischief...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' What are you saying?'' '' And Avdotya Romanovna can't possibly be left in those lodgings without you. Just think where you are staying!
<p/>That blackguard Pyotr Petrovitch couldn't find you better lodgings... But you know I've had a little to drink, and that's what makes me...
<p/>But I'll go to the landlady here,'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted, <div class="bookquote">``I'll beseech her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night.
<p/>swear; don't mind it...''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>'' I can't leave him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) like that, I cannot! '' This conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady's door.
<p/>Half an hour earlier, while he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was bringing Raskolnikov home, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had indeed talked too freely, but he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was aware of it himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had imbibed.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had drunk seemed to fly to his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) head with redoubled effect.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stood with the two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every word he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) uttered, probably to emphasise his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) arguments, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) squeezed their hands painfully as in a vise.
<p/>Nastasya lighted them from a step below. Razumihin was in extraordinary excitement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the least regard for good manners.
<p/>They sometimes pulled their hands out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) drew them all the closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>).
<p/>If they'd told him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) to jump head foremost from the staircase, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) would have done it without thought or hesitation in their service.
<p/>Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man was really too eccentric and pinched her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) hand too much, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) anxiety over her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) Rodya
<p/>But though Avdotya Romanovna shared her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) could not see the glowing light in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes without wonder and almost alarm.
<p/>It was only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya's account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) brother's queer friend, which prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) from trying to run away from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) mother to do the same.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) looked on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) presence as providential, and was unwilling to notice all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) peculiarities. She (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) realised, too, that even running away was perhaps impossible now.
<p/>Ten minutes later, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of Razumihin that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) true nature at once, whatever mood he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) might be in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.
<p/>If you stay, though you are his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, you'll drive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to a frenzy, and then goodness knows what will happen!
<p/>'' You can't go to the landlady, that's perfect nonsense! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried. '' Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do: Nastasya will stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now, and I'll conduct you both home
<p/>Then I'll run straight back here and a quarter of an hour later, on my word of honour, I'll bring you news how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is asleep, and all that.
<p/>, you can't be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that way.... But no matter! Then, listen!
<p/>a lot of friends there, all drunk--I'll fetch Zossimov--that's the doctor who is looking after him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is there, too, but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is not drunk; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is not drunk, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is never drunk!
<p/>I'll drag him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to Rodya, and then to you, so that you'll get two reports in the hour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself
<p/>Then I'll run home in a twinkling--I've , that's a very different thing from my account of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)! If there's anything wrong, I swear I'll bring you here myself, but, if it's all right, you go to bed.
<p/>And I'll spend the night here, in the passage, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) won't hear me, and I'll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady's, to be at hand.
<p/>But the landlady is out of the question; it's all right for me, but it's out of the question for you: she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) wouldn't take you, for she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)'s...
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)'d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you, too, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly.
<p/>Which is better for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>): you or the doctor? So come home then! for she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)'s a fool... She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) is an absolutely, absolutely unaccountable character!
<p/>But I am a fool, too!... No matter! Come along! Do you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) has saved Rodya already, and if the doctor really will consent to spend the night here, what could be better?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Avdotya Romanovna</b></font>)</div>said Avdotya Romanovna, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) will certainly do what he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has promised. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Avdotya Romanovna</b></font>)</div>You see, you... you... understand me, because you are an angel!''
<p/>Razumihin cried in ecstasy, <div class="bookquote">``let us go! Nastasya! Fly upstairs and sit with him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) with a light; I'll come in a quarter of an hour.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made no further resistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down the stairs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) still made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uneasy, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was competent and good-natured, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) capable of carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) promise? He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) seemed in such a condition....
<p/>Razumihin broke in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thoughts, guessing them, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) strolled along the pavement with huge steps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), a fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) did not observe, however.
<p/>'' Ah, I see you think I am in such a condition! '' <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! That is... I am drunk like a fool, but that's not it; I am not drunk from wine.
<p/>It's seeing you has turned my head... But don't mind me! Don't take any notice: I am talking nonsense, I am not worthy of you....
<p/>The minute I've taken you home, I'll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over my head in the gutter here, and then I shall be all right....
<p/>I am utterly unworthy of you! If only you knew how I love you both! Don't laugh, and don't be angry!
<p/>You may be angry with anyone, but not with me! I am his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) friend, and therefore I am your friend, too, I want to be...
<p/>I had a presentiment... Last year there was a moment... though it wasn't a presentiment really, for you seem to have fallen from heaven.
<p/>And I expect I shan't sleep all night... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) would go mad... that's why he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) mustn't be irritated.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What do you say?'' cried the mother. '' Did the doctor really say that?'' asked Avdotya Romanovna, alarmed. ''
<p/>Yes, but it's not so, not a bit of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) some medicine, a powder, I saw it, and then your coming here....
<p/>Ah! It would have been better if you had come to-morrow. It's a good thing we went away. And in an hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is not drunk! And I shan't be drunk.... And what made me get so tight? Because they got me into an argument, damn them!
<p/>I've sworn never to argue! They talk such trash! I almost came to blows! I've left my uncle to preside. Would you believe, they insist on complete absence of individualism and that's just what they relish!
<p/>Not to be themselves, to be as unlike themselves as they can. That's what they regard as the highest point of progress.
<p/>If only their nonsense were their own, but as it is... '' <div class="bookquote">``Listen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly, but it only added fuel to the flames.
<p/>'' What do you think?'' shouted Razumihin, louder than ever, <div class="bookquote">``you think I am attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit!
<p/>I like them to talk nonsense. That's man's one privilege over all creation. Through error you come to the truth! I am a man because I err!
<p/>You never reach any truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and fourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can't even make mistakes on our own account!
<p/>Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense, and I'll kiss you for it. To go wrong in one's own way is better than to go right in someone else's.
<p/>In the first case you are a man, in the second you're no better than a bird. Truth won't escape you, but life can be cramped.
<p/>In science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism, judgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are still in the preparatory class at school.
<p/>There have been examples. And what are we doing now? We prefer to live on other people's ideas, it's what we are used to!
<p/>Am I right, am I right? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>cried Razumihin, pressing and shaking the two ladies' hands. '' Oh, mercy, I do not know,'' cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
<p/>Yes, yes... though I don't agree with you in everything,'' added Avdotya Romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>Romanovna</b></font>) hand so painfully.
<p/>'' '' Yes, you say yes... well after that you... you... '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) cried in a transport, <div class="bookquote">``you are a fount of goodness, purity, sense... and perfection.
<p/>Give me your hand... you give me yours, too! I want to kiss your hands here at once, on my knees...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) knees on the pavement, fortunately at that time deserted. '' Leave off, I entreat you, what are you doing?
<p/>'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna cried, greatly distressed. <div class="bookquote">``Get up, get up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>said Dounia laughing, though she (<font color='blue'><b>yours</b></font>), too, was upset. '' Not for anything till you let me kiss your hands!
<p/>That's it! Enough! I get up and we'll go on! I am a luckless fool, I am unworthy of you and drunk... and I am ashamed....
<p/>I am not worthy to love you, but to do homage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast!
<p/>And I've done homage.... Here are your lodgings, and for that alone Rodya was right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away....
<p/>How dare he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! how dare he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put you in such lodgings! It's a scandal! Do you know the sort of people they take in here?
<p/>And you his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) betrothed! You are his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) betrothed? Yes? Well, then, I'll tell you, your fiancé is a scoundrel.'' <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, Mr. Razumihin, you are forgetting...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning. '' Yes, yes, you are right , I did forget myself, I am ashamed of it,'' Razumihin made haste to apologise.
<p/>'' But... but you can't be angry with me for speaking so! For I speak sincerely and not because... hm, hm!
<p/>That would be disgraceful; in fact not because I'm in... hm! Well, anyway, I won't say why, I daren't.... But we all saw to-day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) came in that that man is not of our sort.
<p/>Not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) hair curled at the barber's, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was in such a hurry to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) wit, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is a spy, a speculator, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is a skin-flint and a buffoon.
<p/>That's evident. Do you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) clever? No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is a fool, a fool. And is he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) a match for you?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms, <div class="bookquote">``though all my friends there are drunk, yet they are all honest, and though we do talk a lot of trash, and I do, too, yet we shall talk our way to the truth at last, for we are on the right path, while Pyotr Petrovitch... is not on the right path.
<p/>Though I've been calling them all sorts of names just now, I do respect them all... though I don't respect Zametov, I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) is an honest man and knows his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) work.
<p/>Good heavens! Do you see, ladies? But enough, it's all said and forgiven. Is it forgiven? Well, then, let's go on.

(<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) daughter with anxiety and dismay.
<p/>'' Don't worry yourself, mother,'' said Dounia, taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) hat and cape. '' God has sent this gentleman to our aid, though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has come from a drinking party.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is quite unhinged by serious illness--that's the reason. '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, that illness! What will happen, what will happen? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will think better of it to-morrow,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) added, probing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) further.
<p/>'' And I am sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will say the same to-morrow... about that,'' Avdotya Romanovna said finally. And, of course, there was no going beyond that
<p/>, for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was afraid to discuss. Dounia went up and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother. The latter warmly embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) without speaking.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat down to wait anxiously for Razumihin's return, timidly watching her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter who walked up and down the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms folded, lost in thought.
<p/>This walking up and down when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was thinking was a habit of Avdotya Romanovna's and the mother was always afraid to break in on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter's mood at such moments.
<p/>Yet apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) eccentric condition, many people would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya Romanovna, especially at that moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was walking to and fro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy.
<p/>Avdotya Romanovna was remarkably good-looking; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was tall, strikingly well-proportioned, strong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in every gesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and softness of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) movements.
<p/>Razumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) sudden drunken infatuation for Avdotya Romanovna. In face she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) resembled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might be described as really beautiful.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hair was dark brown, a little lighter than her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother's; there was a proud light in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) almost black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected a little as did her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chin; it was the only irregularity in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) beautiful face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty expression.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay; but how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible, laughter suited her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face!
<p/>It was natural enough that a warm, open, simple-hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen anyone like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) head immediately.
<p/>Besides, as chance would have it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) saw Dounia for the first time transfigured by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) joy at meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/>Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lower lip quiver with indignation at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother's insolent, cruel and ungrateful words--and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fate was sealed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had spoken the truth, moreover, when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) blurted out in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) drunken talk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikov's eccentric landlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of Avdotya Romanovna on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) account.
<p/>Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was forty-three, her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) face still retained traces of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) former beauty; she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) looked much younger than her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) age, indeed, which is almost always the case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was pale, but it was a healthy pallor; her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) face was radiant with freshness and vigour. We may add in parenthesis that to preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) hair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow's foot wrinkles round her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) cheeks were hollow and sunken from anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was Dounia over again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and yielding, but only to a certain point.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) could give way and accept a great deal even of what was contrary to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) convictions, but there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions which nothing would induce her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to cross.
<p/>Exactly twenty minutes after Razumihin's departure, there came two subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had come back. ''
<p/>I won't come in, I haven't time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) hastened to say when the door was opened. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may sleep ten hours.
<p/>Now I am fetching Zossimov, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will report to you and then you'd better turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything....
<p/>Nastasya's with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) not to leave till I came. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ran off down the corridor. ''
<p/>What a very competent and... devoted young man! '' cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna exceedingly delighted. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems a splendid person!'' Avdotya Romanovna replied with some warmth, resuming her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) walk up and down the room.
<p/>It was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor and another knock at the door. Both women waited this time completely relying on Razumihin's promise; he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) actually had succeeded in bringing Zossimov.
<p/>Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to go to Raskolnikov's, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) came reluctantly and with the greatest suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) exhilarated condition.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) saw that they were really expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) as an oracle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) stayed just ten minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two ladies.
<p/>Remarking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya Romanovna, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) endeavoured not to notice her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) at all during his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) visit and addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation. All this gave him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) extraordinary inward satisfaction.
<p/>According to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) observations the patient's illness was due partly to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) unfortunate material surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also a moral origin, <div class="bookquote">``was, so to speak, the product of several material and moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas... and so on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) thought the invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the patient</b></font>)</div>Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) words with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this theme.
<p/>On Pulcheria Alexandrovna's anxiously and timidly inquiring as to <div class="bookquote">``some suspicion of insanity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) replied with a composed and candid smile that his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient had some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>), Zossimov, was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in delirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) family would have a favourable effect on his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) recovery and distract his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) mind, <div class="bookquote">``if only all fresh shocks can be avoided,''  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) added significantly.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) got up, took leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm gratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>), and Avdotya Romanovna spontaneously offered her (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) went out exceedingly pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) visit and still more so with himself. '' We'll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!
<p/>'' Razumihin said in conclusion, following Zossimov out. '' I'll be with you to-morrow morning as early as possible with my report.
<p/>That's a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna,'' remarked Zossimov, almost licking his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) lips as they both came out into the street.
<p/>'' '' '' Fetching? You said fetching? '' roared Razumihin and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) flew at Zossimov and seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) by the throat.
<p/>'' If you ever dare.... Do you understand? Do you understand? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) shouted, shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) by the collar and squeezing him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) against the wall.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me go, you drunken devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div>said Zossimov, struggling and when he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had let him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) go, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) and went off into a sudden guffaw.
<p/>'' Do you hear?'' Razumihin stood facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) in gloomy and earnest reflection. '' Of course, I am an ass,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) observed, sombre as a storm cloud, ``but still...
<p/>They walked along in silence and only when they were close to Raskolnikov's lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerable anxiety.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you're a first-rate fellow, but among your other failings, you're a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too.

<p/>'' Well, you are smitten! But what am I to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``It won't be much trouble, I assure you.
<p/>Talk any rot you like to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), as long as you sit by her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) and talk. You're a doctor, too; try curing her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) of something.
<p/>I swear you won't regret it. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) has a piano, and you know, I strum a little. I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: 'I shed hot tears.'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) likes the genuine article--and well, it all began with that song; Now you're a regular performer, a maître , a Rubinstein....
<p/>I assure you, you won't regret it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But have you made her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) some promise? Something signed? A promise of marriage, perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tchebarov/Mr. Tchebarov</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But I can't drop her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) like that!'' <div class="bookquote">``Why can't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I can't, that's all about it! There's an element of attraction here, brother.''
<p/>'' Then why have you fascinated her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``I haven't fascinated her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>); perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly.

<p/>look here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now... begin teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) the integral calculus; upon my soul, I'm not joking, I'm in earnest, it'll be just the same to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>).
<p/>I talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) once for two days at a time about the Prussian House of Lords -LRB-for one must talk of something-RRB---she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) just sighed and perspired!
<p/>I can't explain the position, brother... She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) will gaze at you and sigh for a whole year together.

<p/>But there can't be... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER II Razumihin waked up next morning at eight o'clock, troubled and serious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) remembered every detail of the previous day and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) knew that a perfectly novel experience had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had received an impression unlike anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had known before.
<p/>At the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) recognised clearly that the dream which had fired his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) imagination was hopelessly unattainable--so unattainable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) felt positively ashamed of it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties bequeathed him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) by that ``thrice accursed yesterday.
<p/>The most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had shown himself <div class="bookquote">``base and mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>not only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had been drunk, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had taken advantage of the young girl's position to abuse her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fiancé in his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never expected that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would ever wake up feeling like that. '' And what right had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to criticise him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in that hasty and unguarded manner?
<p/>Who had asked for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as Avdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money?
<p/>So there must be something in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The lodgings? But after all how could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know the character of the lodgings?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was furnishing a flat... Foo! how despicable it all was! And what justification was it that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was drunk? Such a stupid excuse was even more degrading!
<p/>In wine is truth, and the truth had all come out, <div class="bookquote">``that is, all the uncleanness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coarse and envious heart'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>!
<p/>And would such a dream ever be permissible to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Razumihin? What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) beside such a girl--he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), the drunken noisy braggart of last night?
<p/>Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of Avdotya Romanovna...
<p/>Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical a juxtaposition? that was simply intolerable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) fist down heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) hand and sent one of the bricks flying.
<p/>Of course,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of self-abasement, <div class="bookquote">``of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or smoothed over...
<p/>and so it's useless even to think of it, and I must go to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask forgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And yet as he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) dressed he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) attire more carefully than usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) hadn't another suit--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had had, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) wouldn't have put it on.
<p/>But in any case he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had no right to offend the feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) assistance and asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) to see them.
<p/>'' I would have made a point of not putting it on. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) clothes carefully. His (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) linen was always decent; in that respect he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was especially clean.
<p/>When it came to the question whether to shave his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) stubbly chin or not -LRB-Praskovya Pavlovna had capital razors that had been left by her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) late husband-RRB-, the question was angrily answered in the negative.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) washed that morning scrupulously--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) got some soap from Nastasya--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) washed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hair, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) neck and especially his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``Let it stay as it is!
<p/>And... the worst of it was he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was so coarse, so dirty, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had the manners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had some of the essentials of a gentleman...
<p/>What if they think that I shaved on purpose to...? They certainly would think so! Not on any account!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' what was there in that to be proud of?
<p/>Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all the same -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) remembered-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), too, had done little things... not exactly dishonest, and yet
<p/>.... And what thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sometimes had; hm... and to set all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! Confound it! So be it!
<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'d make a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) manners and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wouldn't care! He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'d be worse!
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the night in Praskovya Pavlovna's parlour, came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.
<p/>Razumihin informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse. Zossimov gave orders that they shouldn't wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and promised to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) again about eleven.
<p/>'' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is still at home,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added. '' Damn it all! If one can't control one's patients, how is one to cure them?

<p/>But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; I've plenty to do besides looking after them.''
<p/>'' '' '' One thing worries me,'' interposed Razumihin, frowning. '' On the way home I talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)...
<p/>all sorts of things... and amongst them that you were afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)... might become insane.'' <div class="bookquote">``You told the ladies so, too.''

<p/>You, yourself, described him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) as a monomaniac when you fetched me to him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, with your story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) was, perhaps, mad on that very point!
<p/>If only I'd known what happened then at the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) with this suspicion!
<p/>Hm... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday. These monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... and see their fancies as solid realities....
<p/>Why, I know one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat of a little boy of eight, because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) couldn't endure the jokes he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made every day at table!
<p/>As far as I remember, it was Zametov's story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. And in this case his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) rags, the insolent police officer, the fever and this suspicion!
<p/>All that working upon a man half frantic with hypochondria, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) morbid exceptional vanity! That may well have been the starting-point of illness.
<p/>And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but hm... he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) shouldn't have told all that last night.
<p/>Well, bother it all! ... He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) is an awful chatterbox!'' '' But whom did he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) tell it to? You and me?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Porfiry. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What does that matter? '' '' And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) mother and sister?

(<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Razumihin answered reluctantly. '' Why is he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) so set against this Luzhin?
<p/>A man with money and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) doesn't seem to dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)... and they haven't a farthing, I suppose? eh?'' '' But what business is it of yours?
<p/>'' Razumihin cried with annoyance. '' How can I tell whether they've a farthing? Ask them yourself and perhaps you'll find out...''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Foo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last night's wine has not gone off yet.... Good-bye ; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night's lodging.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) locked herself in, made no reply to my bonjour through the door; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was up at seven o'clock, the samovar was taken into her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) from the kitchen.
<p/>I was not vouchsafed a personal interview...''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>At nine o'clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev's house. Both ladies were waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) with nervous impatience.
<p/>They had risen at seven o'clock or earlier. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) entered looking as black as night, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had reckoned without his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) by both hands and was almost kissing them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) glanced timidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) proud countenance wore at that moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such complete and unlooked-for respect -LRB-in place of the sneering looks and ill-disguised contempt he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had expected-RRB-, that it threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) into greater confusion than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had been met with abuse.
<p/>Hearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked, Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was glad to hear it, because <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over beforehand.
<p/>Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation to have it with them; they had waited to have it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>).
<p/>Avdotya Romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) to bring tea which was served at last, but in such a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed.
<p/>Razumihin vigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna's questions, which showered in a continual stream upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted by their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the most important facts he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) knew of the last year of Raskolnikov's life, concluding with a circumstantial account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) illness.
<p/>Fortunately there was a subject for conversation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) made haste to snatch at it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) omitted, however, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at the police station with all its consequences.
<p/>They listened eagerly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) story, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had finished and satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) listeners, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) found that they considered he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had hardly begun.
<p/>'' Tell me, tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me, I still don't know your name!'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) looks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are his (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) likes and dislikes?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri/Dmitri Prokofitch</b></font>)</div>Dmitri Prokofitch. '' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) always so irritable? Tell me, if you can, what are his (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) hopes and, so to say, his (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) dreams?
<p/>Under what influences is he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) now? In a word, I should like...'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, mother, how can he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) answer all that at once?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>observed Dounia.

<p/>I have no mother, but my uncle comes every year and almost every time he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) can scarcely recognise me, even in appearance, though he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is a clever man; and your three years' separation means a great deal.
<p/>I have known Rodion for a year and a half; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of late--and perhaps for a long time before--he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has been suspicious and fanciful.
<p/>'' What am I to tell you? He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has a noble nature and a kind heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) does not like showing his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) heart freely.
<p/>Sometimes, though, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is not at all morbid, but simply cold and inhumanly callous; it's as though he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) were alternating between two characters.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is fearfully reserved! He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) lies in bed doing nothing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) doesn't jeer at things, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hasn't the wit, but as though he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hadn't time to waste on such trifles.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) never listens to what is said to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is never interested in what interests other people at any given moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) thinks very highly of himself and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most beneficial influence upon him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``God grant it may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed by Razumihin's account of her (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) Rodya. And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.
<p/>Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) arms folded and her (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question, without stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) walk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) often while he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was talking, but only for a moment and looked away again at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had the same habit of not listening to what was said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had a white transparent scarf round her (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of extreme poverty in their belongings.
<p/>Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed like a queen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) would not be afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), but perhaps just because she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was poorly dressed and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) noticed all the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) surroundings, his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) heart was filled with dread and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) began to be afraid of every word he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) uttered, every gesture he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) made, which was very trying for a man who already felt diffident.
<p/>'' You've told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother's character... and have told it impartially. I am glad.
<p/>I thought that you were too uncritically devoted to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>),'' observed Avdotya Romanovna with a smile. '' I think you are right that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) needs a woman's care,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added thoughtfully.
<p/>'' I didn't say so; but I daresay you are right, only... '' <div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) loves no one and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) never will,'' Razumihin declared decisively.
<p/>'' You mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is not capable of love?'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in everything, indeed!
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) blurted out suddenly to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own surprise, but remembering at once what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had just before said of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Avdotya Romanovna</b></font>)</div>Avdotya Romanovna couldn't help laughing when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). '' You may both be mistaken about Rodya,'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked, slightly piqued.
<p/>What Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have supposed may be mistaken, but you can't imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how moody and, so to say, capricious he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) is.
<p/>'' I am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia. I never could depend on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) would do when he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) was only fifteen.
<p/>Well, for instance, do you know how a year and a half ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) astounded me and gave me a shock that nearly killed me,
<p/>And I am sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) might do something now that nobody else would think of doing... when he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) had the idea of marrying that girl--what was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name--his (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) landlady's daughter?''
<p/>Do you suppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from grief, our poverty would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) pause?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you hear about that affair?''  (<font color='red'><b>Avdotya Romanovna</b></font>)</div>asked Avdotya Romanovna. '' Do you suppose--'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. '' No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) would calmly have disregarded all obstacles.
<p/>And yet it isn't that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) doesn't love us!'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) has never spoken a word of that affair to me,'' Razumihin answered cautiously.
<p/>'' But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself, though she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was rather strange.''
<p/>I only learned that the marriage, which only failed to take place through the girl's death, was not at all to Praskovya Pavlovna's liking.
<p/>They say, too, the girl was not at all pretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and queer.
<p/>'' And what did you hear? '' both the ladies asked at once. '' Well, nothing very special. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seems to have had some good qualities.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must have had some good qualities or it's quite inexplicable.... She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had no money either and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wouldn't have considered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money....
<p/>But it's always difficult to judge in such matters. '' <div class="bookquote">``I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a good girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Avdotya Romanovna</b></font>)</div>Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly.
<p/>Though I don't know which of them would have caused most misery to the other--he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began tentatively questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) about the scene on the previous day with Luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to the latter's annoyance.
<p/>'' God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) death. This incident more than all the rest evidently caused her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) uneasiness, even consternation.
<p/>Razumihin described it in detail again, but this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) added his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) own conclusions: he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) openly blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not seeking to excuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) on the score of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) illness.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had planned it before his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) illness,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) added. '' I think so, too,'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself so carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.
<p/>Avdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it. '' So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna could not resist asking.
<p/>I can have no other opinion of your daughter's future husband,'' Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, <div class="bookquote">``and I don't say it simply from vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna has of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own free will deigned to accept this man.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>If I spoke so rudely of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and... mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this morning I am ashamed of it.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not break the silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had not uttered a word from the moment they began to speak of Luzhin.
<p/>Without her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what to do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) confessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.
<p/>'' You see, Dmitri Prokofitch,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) began. '' I'll be perfectly open with Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?'' <div class="bookquote">``Of course, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Avdotya Romanovna</b></font>)</div>said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.
<p/>This is what it is,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began in haste, as though the permission to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) trouble lifted a weight off her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind.
<p/>'' '' Very early this morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter announcing our arrival.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) promised to meet us at the station, you know; instead of that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) sent a servant to bring us the address of these lodgings and to show us the way; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) sent a message that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) would be here himself this morning.
<p/>But this morning this note came from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>). You'd better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me very much...
<p/>you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid opinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya's character better than anyone and no one can advise us better than you can.
<p/>Dounia, I must tell you, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dounia</b></font>) decision at once, but I still don't feel sure how to act and I...
<p/>Razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read as follows: ``Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at the railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object in view.
<p/>I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of delay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you are meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) brother.
<p/>I shall have the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings not later than to-morrow evening at eight o'clock precisely, and herewith
<p/>I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my visit to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own interpretation.
<p/>I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation, that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to blame.
<p/>I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able to leave the house, may visit you also.
<p/>I was confirmed in that belief by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of notorious behaviour, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to raise that sum.
<p/>Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable daughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage of ``Your humble servant, <div class="bookquote">``P. LUZHIN.
<p/>I've been waiting for your opinion. ''  (<font color='red'><b>servant LUZHIN</b></font>)</div>'' '' What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?'' began Pulcheria Alexandrovna, almost weeping.
<p/>'' How can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) insisted so earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not to receive Rodya!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) will come on purpose if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) knows, and... what will happen then?'' <div class="bookquote">``Act on Avdotya Romanovna's decision,''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin answered calmly at once.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) says that it would be best, at least, not that it would be best, but that it's absolutely necessary that Rodya should make a point of being here at eight o'clock and that they must meet....
<p/>I didn't want even to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) the letter, but to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) from coming by some stratagem with your help... because he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is so irritable....
<p/>Besides I don't understand about that drunkard who died and that daughter, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) could have given the daughter all the money...
<p/>'' Oh, dear me! She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) says... goodness knows what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) says, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) doesn't explain her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) object! which... '' '' Which cost you such sacrifice, mother,'' put in Avdotya Romanovna.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) was not himself yesterday,'' Razumihin said thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``if you only knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there was sense in it too....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) did say something, as we were going home yesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn't understand a word...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Hm! But last night, I myself... '' <div class="bookquote">``The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ourselves
<p/>Besides, it's getting late--good heavens, it's past ten,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried looking at a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) neck on a thin Venetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dress.
<p/>and there I assure you we shall see at once what's to be done. '' A present from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fiancé ,'' thought Razumihin.
<p/>'' We must start, Dounia, we must start,'' her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother cried in a flutter. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>fiancé</b></font>) will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our coming so late.
<p/>Merciful heavens! '' While she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said this she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was hurriedly putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hat and mantle; Dounia, too, put on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) things.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were not merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty gave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in people who know how to wear poor clothes.
<p/>The queen who mended her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) stockings in prison,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``must have looked then every inch a queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levées.

<p/>Razumihin looked reverently at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>I am afraid, Dmitri Prokofitch,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) added, glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) timidly.

<p/>They came out into the street. '' Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of Marfa Petrovna...
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came up to me, took my hand, and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head at me, but so sternly as though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were blaming me....
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was all in white... Is that a good omen? Oh, dear me! You don't know, Dmitri Prokofitch, that Marfa Petrovna's dead!''

<p/>The ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they reached the landlady's door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching them from the darkness within.
<p/>What an awful staircase!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Wait, I'll peep in and see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) has waked up. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>When their eyes met, the door was suddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried out.
<p/>CHAPTER III '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is well, quite well!'' Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place as before, on the sofa.
<p/>Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner, fully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had not been for some time past.
<p/>Raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) condition the day before, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was still pale, listless, and sombre.
<p/>The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked like a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) brows were knitted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lips compressed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes feverish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) spoke little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a restlessness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) movements.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) only wanted a sling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) arm or a bandage on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) finger to complete the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm.
<p/>The pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother and sister entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in place of its listless dejection.
<p/>The light soon died away, but the look of suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) patient with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) no joy at the arrival of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother and sister, but a sort of bitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable torture.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw later that almost every word of the following conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it.
<p/>But at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) marvelled at the power of controlling himself and hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a monomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.
<p/>Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well,'' said Raskolnikov, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria Alexandrovna radiant at once.
<p/>And I don't say this as I did yesterday ,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, addressing Razumihin, with a friendly pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to-day,'' began Zossimov, much delighted at the ladies' entrance, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had not succeeded in keeping up a conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) patient for ten minutes.
<p/>In another three or four days, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) goes on like this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) will be just as before, that is, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three.
<p/>'' '' '' '' This has been coming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has been perhaps your own fault?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added, with a tentative smile, as though still afraid of irritating him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' It is very possible,'' answered Raskolnikov coldly.
<p/>Now that one can talk to you, I should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the elementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your morbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go from bad to worse.
<p/>'' I should say, too,'' continued Zossimov with zest, <div class="bookquote">``that your complete recovery depends solely on yourself. These fundamental causes I don't know, but they must be known to you.
<p/>You are an intelligent man, and must have observed yourself, of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangement coincides with your leaving the university.
<p/>You must not be left without occupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, I fancy, be very beneficial.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; you are perfectly right.... I will make haste and return to the university: and then everything will go smoothly...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div>Zossimov, who had begun his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sage advice partly to make an effect before the ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) patient, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) observed unmistakable mockery on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
<p/>This lasted an instant, however. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking Zossimov, especially for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visit to their lodging the previous night.
<p/>'' What! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw you last night? '' Raskolnikov asked, as though startled. '' Then you have not slept either after your journey.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o'clock. Dounia and I never go to bed before two at home.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov went on, suddenly frowning and looking down.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Setting aside the question of payment--forgive me for referring to it -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned to Zossimov-RRB---I really don't know what I have done to deserve such special attention from you!
<p/>I simply don't understand it... and... and... it weighs upon me, indeed, because I don't understand it. I tell you so candidly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>patient fellows</b></font>)</div><p/>Assume that you are my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love our first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in love with them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin, ``though he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be irritated. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div>Zossimov forced himself to laugh. '' And, of course, I am not rich in patients. '' ''
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had had more penetration he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) would have seen that there was no trace of sentimentality in him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), but something indeed quite the opposite.
<p/>'' What nonsense he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is talking! Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day, are you?'' shouted Razumihin. But Avdotya Romanovna noticed it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was intently and uneasily watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) brother. '' As for you, mother, I don't dare to speak,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went on, as though repeating a lesson learned by heart.
<p/>It is only to-day that I have been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here yesterday, waiting for me to come back.
<p/>'' '' When he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had said this, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) suddenly held out his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister, smiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of real unfeigned feeling.
<p/>Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand, overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) since their dispute the previous day.
<p/>The mother's face lighted up with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken reconciliation. '' Yes, that is what I love him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) for,
<p/>'' Razumihin, exaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) chair. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) has these movements.'' ''
<p/>What generous impulses he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) has, and how simply, how delicately he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) put an end to all the misunderstanding with his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) sister--simply by holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) hand at the right minute and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) like that....
<p/>And how well he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) does it all,'' the mother was thinking to herself. '' And what fine eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) has, and how fine his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) whole face is!
<p/>... He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is even better looking than Dounia.... But, good heavens, what a suit--how terribly he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'s dressed!... Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch's shop, is better dressed!
<p/>I could rush at him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) and hug him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)... weep over him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)--but I am afraid.... Oh, dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'s so strange! He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'s talking kindly, but I'm afraid!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Rodya, you wouldn't believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) began suddenly, in haste to answer his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday!
<p/>Why, what am I afraid of?... ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Now that it's all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I can tell you.
<p/>Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace you and that woman--ah, here she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is! Good morning, Nastasya!...
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away from the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the streets.
<p/>You can't imagine how we felt! I couldn't help thinking of the tragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father's
<p/>--you can't remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>), Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn't pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) out till next day.
<p/>Of course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point of rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) to help....
<p/>Because we were alone, utterly alone,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) said plaintively and stopped short, suddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr Petrovitch, although <div class="bookquote">``we are quite happy again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, yes .... Of course it's very annoying... '' Raskolnikov muttered in reply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in perplexity.
<p/>'' What else was it I wanted to say? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went on trying to recollect. '' Oh, yes; mother, and you too
<p/>, Dounia, please don't think that I didn't mean to come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What are you saying, Rodya? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), too, was surprised. '' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) answering us as a duty?''
<p/>Dounia wondered. '' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) being reconciled and asking forgiveness as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) were performing a rite or repeating a lesson?''
<p/>I've only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing to my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)...
<p/>'' Nastasya... to wash out the blood ... I've only just dressed.'' <div class="bookquote">``Blood! What blood? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm.
<p/>It was when I was wandering about yesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been run over... a clerk...
<p/>'' Oh, nothing--don't be uneasy. '' <div class="bookquote">``Delirious? But you remember everything!''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin interrupted. '' That's true,'' Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness.
<p/>I remember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet--why I did that and went there and said that, I can't clearly explain now.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A familiar phenomenon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div>interposed Zossimov, <div class="bookquote">``actions are sometimes performed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--it's like a dream.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it's a good thing really that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) should think me almost a madman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>thought Raskolnikov. '' Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too,'' observed Dounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.
<p/>In that sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we must draw a line.
<p/>'' There is some truth in your observation,'' the latter replied. '' A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among dozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with.
<p/>'' At the word <div class="bookquote">``madman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div>carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) chatter on his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) favourite subject, everyone frowned. Raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a strange smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pale lips.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was still meditating on something. '' Well, what about the man who was run over? I interrupted you!'' Razumihin cried hastily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. '' Oh... I got spattered with blood helping to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lodging.
<p/>By the way, mamma, I did an unpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave away all the money you sent me... to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wife for the funeral.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s a widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children, starving... nothing in the house... there's a daughter, too...
<p/>perhaps you'd have given it yourself if you'd seen them. But I had no right to do it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.
<p/>To help others one must have the right to do it, or else Crevez, chiens, si vous n'êtes pas contents .
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) laughed, <div class="bookquote">``That's right, isn't it, Dounia?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' No, it's not,'' answered Dounia firmly. '' Bah! you, too, have ideals,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) muttered, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) almost with hatred, and smiling sarcastically.
<p/>and if you reach a line you won't overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it, maybe you will be still unhappier...
<p/>'' I ought to have considered that.... Well, that's praiseworthy, and it's better for you... But all that's nonsense,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added irritably, vexed at being carried away.
<p/>'' I only meant to say that I beg your forgiveness, mother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) concluded, shortly and abruptly. '' That's enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother, delighted.
<p/>There was a certain constraint in all this conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the forgiveness, and all were feeling it.
<p/>It is as though they were afraid of me,'' Raskolnikov was thinking to himself, looking askance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother and sister.
<p/>'' Don't be too sure,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) answered, twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mouth into a smile. A silence followed. '' Pulcheria Alexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kept silent.
<p/>'' Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much,'' flashed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind. '' Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead,'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna suddenly blurted out.
<p/>'' What Marfa Petrovna?'' '' Oh, mercy on us--Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov. I wrote you so much about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).'' '' A-a-h! Yes, I remember....
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s dead! Oh, really? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) roused himself suddenly, as if waking up. '' What did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) die of?'' ''
<p/>Only imagine, quite suddenly,'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered hurriedly, encouraged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) curiosity. '' On the very day I was sending you that letter!
<p/>Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death. They say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beat her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dreadfully.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, were they on such bad terms? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked, addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister. '' Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed.
<p/>In fact, all those seven years of their married life he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave way to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), too much so indeed, in many cases.
<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always very patient, considerate even. All of a sudden he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems to have lost patience.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not have been so awful if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) controlled himself for seven years?
<p/>You seem to be defending him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Dounia?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s an awful man! I can imagine nothing more awful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>Dounia answered, almost with a shudder, knitting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brows, and sinking into thought.
<p/>'' That had happened in the morning,'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on hurriedly. '' And directly afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ordered the horses to be harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) always used to drive to the town in such cases. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ate a very good dinner, I am told... '' <div class="bookquote">``After the beating?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>That was always her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not to be late in starting, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) went to the bath-house....
<p/>They have a cold spring there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) got into the water when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) suddenly had a stroke!''
<p/>'' You see, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was undergoing some treatment with baths. <div class="bookquote">``I should think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossimov</b></font>)</div>said Zossimov. '' And did he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) beat her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) badly?''
<p/>But I don't know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,'' said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself.
<p/>'' What does that matter! '' put in Dounia. <div class="bookquote">``H'm! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Ah, my dear, I don't know what to talk about,'' broke from Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
<p/>'' Why, are you all afraid of me? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked, with a constrained smile. '' That's certainly true,'' said Dounia, looking directly and sternly at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother.
<p/>'' Mother was crossing herself with terror as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came up the stairs. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face worked, as though in convulsion.
<p/>Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, overwhelmed--<div class="bookquote">``You see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the train, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything together...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>Ach, what are you saying, Dounia! Don't be angry, please, Rodya .... Why did you say that, Dounia?'' And I was so happy
<p/>, I did not notice the journey! But what am I saying? I am happy now.... You should not, Dounia.... I am happy now--simply in seeing you, Rodya...
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Hush, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) muttered in confusion, not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand. '' We shall have time to speak freely of everything!''
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said this, he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned pale. Again that awful sensation he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had known of late passed with deadly chill over his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soul.
<p/>Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had just told a fearful lie--that he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would never now be able to speak freely of everything--that he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would never again be able to speak of anything to anyone.
<p/>The anguish of this thought was such that for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) almost forgot himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seat, and not looking at anyone walked towards the door.
<p/>'' What are you about?'' cried Razumihin, clutching him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) by the arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) sat down again, and began looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), in silence.
<p/>They were all looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) in perplexity. '' But what are you all so dull for? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) shouted, suddenly and quite unexpectedly.
<p/>'' Do say something! What's the use of sitting like this? Come, do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....
<p/>Come, anything!'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. ''
<p/>What is the matter, Rodya?'' asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully. '' Oh, nothing! I remembered something,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) answered, and suddenly laughed. ''
<p/>Well, if you remembered something; that's all right! ... I was beginning to think... '' muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa.
<p/>'' It is time for me to be off. I will look in again perhaps... if I can... '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bows, and went out.
<p/>Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent,'' Raskolnikov began, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had not shown till then.
<p/>'' What an excellent man!'' observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. '' '' I can't remember where I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) before my illness.... I believe I have met him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) somewhere--...
<p/>And this is a good man, too,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) nodded at Razumihin. '' Do you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), Dounia? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.
<p/>'' Very much,'' answered Dounia. '' Foo!--what a pig you are!'' Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible confusion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) chair.
<p/>Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled faintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud. '' Where are you off to?'' <div class="bookquote">``I must go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You need not at all.
<p/>Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Don't go. What's the time? Is it twelve o'clock? What a pretty watch you have got, Dounia.
<p/>But why are you all silent again? I do all the talking. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>'' It was a present from Marfa Petrovna,'' answered Dounia.
<p/>'' And a very expensive one!'' added Pulcheria Alexandrovna. '' A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady's. '' ''
<p/>I like that sort,'' said Dounia. '' So it is not a present from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fiancé ,'' thought Razumihin, and was unreasonably delighted.
<p/>'' I thought it was Luzhin's present,'' observed Raskolnikov. '' No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) has not made Dounia any presents yet. '' ''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said suddenly, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother, who was disconcerted by the sudden change of subject and the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) spoke of it.
<p/>A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get married? '' '' Oh, yes, my dear.
<p/>'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin. '' H'm, yes. What shall I tell you? I don't remember much indeed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was always dreaming of a nunnery, and once she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) burst into tears when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began talking to me about it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was such a sickly girl,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went on, growing dreamy and looking down again. '' Quite an invalid. Yes, yes, I remember.
<p/>I remember very well. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was an ugly little thing. I really don't know what drew me to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) then--I think it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was always ill.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been lame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) better still,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smiled dreamily. '' Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium.''
<p/>'' No, it was not only spring delirium,'' said Dounia, with warm feeling. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fixed a strained intent look on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sister, but did not hear or did not understand her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) words.
<p/>Then, completely lost in thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) got up, went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mother, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) place and sat down.
<p/>'' You love her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) even now?'' said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched. '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? No... that's all now, as it were, in another world... and so long ago.
<p/>And indeed everything happening here seems somehow far away. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked attentively at them. '' You, now... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...
<p/>but, goodness knows why we are talking of that! And what's the use of asking about it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) added with annoyance, and biting his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) nails, fell into dreamy silence again.
<p/>'' What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It's like a tomb,'' said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. ''
<p/>I am sure it's quite half through your lodging you have become so melancholy.'' '' My lodging,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answered, listlessly. ''
<p/>Yes, the lodging had a great deal to do with it.... I thought that, too.... If only you knew, though, what a strange thing you said just now, mother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, laughing strangely.
<p/>A little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister, with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) after three years' absence, this intimate tone of conversation, in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything, would have been beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) power of endurance.
<p/>But there was one urgent matter which must be settled one way or the other that day-- so he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had decided when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) woke.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen, Dounia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) began, gravely and drily, <div class="bookquote">``of course I beg your pardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that I do not withdraw from my chief point.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was glad to remember it, as a means of escape. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a scoundrel, you must not be.
<p/>One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease at once to look on you as a sister.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Rodya, Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>Pulcheria Alexandrovna cried, mournfully.
<p/>'' And why do you call yourself a scoundrel? I can't bear it. You said the same yesterday.'' '' Brother,'' Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness.
<p/>'' In all this there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night, and found out the mistake.
<p/>It is all because you seem to fancy I am sacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case at all.
<p/>I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for me. Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to my family.
<p/>But that is not the chief motive for my decision... '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is lying,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) thought to himself, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) nails vindictively.
<p/>'' Proud creature! She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) won't admit she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) wants to do it out of charity! Too haughty! Oh, base characters! They even love as though they hate....
<p/>Oh, how I... hate them all!'' <div class="bookquote">``In fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>continued Dounia, <div class="bookquote">``I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of two evils I choose the less.
<p/>I intend to do honestly all he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) expects of me, so I am not deceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>).... Why did you smile just now?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), too, flushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) eyes. '' All? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) asked, with a malignant grin. ''
<p/>Within certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch's courtship showed me at once what he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) may, of course, think too well of himself, but I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) esteems me, too....
<p/>Why are you laughing again?'' '' And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are intentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your own against me....
<p/>So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you are acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it.
<p/>You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) and talked with him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>). '' <div class="bookquote">``It is not true. I am not lying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>cried Dounia, losing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) composure.
<p/>'' I would not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) if I were not convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) esteems me and thinks highly of me. I would not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) if I were not firmly convinced that I can respect him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>).
<p/>Fortunately, I can have convincing proof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as you say!
<p/>And even if you were right, if I really had determined on a vile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?
<p/>Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? It is despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin anyone, it is only myself....
<p/>I am not committing a murder. Why do you look at me like that? Why are you so pale? Rodya, darling, what's the matter?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens! You have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) faint,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. '' No, no, nonsense! It's nothing. A little giddiness--not fainting. You have fainting on the brain.
<p/>In what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>)... esteems you, as you said.
<p/>H'm , yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. I think you said to-day?'' '' Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch's letter,'' said Dounia.
<p/>With trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) the letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) took it with great interest, but, before opening it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) suddenly looked with a sort of wonder at Dounia.
<p/>'' It is strange,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea. '' What am I making such a fuss for?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for some time at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) sister, as though puzzled.
<p/>What is it all about? Marry whom you like! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) opened the letter at last, still with the same look of strange wonder on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) face.
<p/>Then, slowly and attentively, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) began reading, and read it through twice. Pulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected something particular.
<p/>What surprises me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) began, after a short pause, handing the letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, <div class="bookquote">``is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) is a business man, a lawyer, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) conversation is pretentious indeed, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodya</b></font>) writes such an uneducated letter.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>anyone</b></font>)</div>'' They all started. They had expected something quite different. '' But they all write like that, you know,'' Razumihin observed, abruptly.
<p/>'' Have you read it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), Rodya. We... consulted him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, embarrassed. '' That's just the jargon of the courts,'' Razumihin put in.
<p/>'' Legal documents are written like that to this day.'' <div class="bookquote">``Legal? Yes, it's just legal-- business language-- not so very uneducated, and not quite educated--business language!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had a cheap education, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is proud indeed of having made his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) own way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Avdotya Romanovna</b></font>)</div>Avdotya Romanovna observed, somewhat offended by her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) brother's tone.
<p/>You seem to be offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the letter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to annoy you.
<p/>It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand.
<p/>There is one expression, `blame yourselves' put in very significantly and plainly, and there is besides a threat that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) will go away at once if I am present.
<p/>That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon you both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning you to Petersburg.
<p/>Can one resent such an expression from Luzhin, as we should if he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) pointed to Razumihin-RRB- had written it, or Zossimov, or one of us?''
<p/>'' Well, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'s proud of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) has reason, I don't deny it. Well, what do you think? '' N-no
<p/>,'' answered Dounia, with more animation. '' I saw clearly that it was too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) simply has no skill in writing...
<p/>that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect, indeed...'' <div class="bookquote">``It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) intended.
<p/>But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression in the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one.
<p/>I gave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed with trouble, and not `on the pretext of the funeral,' but simply to pay for the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) writes, of notorious behaviour -LRB-whom I saw last night for the first time in my life-RRB---but to the widow.
<p/>It is expressed again in legal jargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and with a very naïve eagerness.
<p/>In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander me and to raise dissension between us. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is a man of intelligence, but to act sensibly, intelligence is not enough.
<p/>It all shows the man and... I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to warn you, because I sincerely wish for your good...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Dounia did not reply. Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) resolution had been taken. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was only awaiting the evening. '' Then what is your decision, Rodya?
<p/>'' asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who was more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talk. '' What decision?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this evening, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will go away if you come.
<p/>That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are not offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), too, is not offended.
<p/>So will you... come?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I will do what you think best,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, drily. '' Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to declare.
<p/>I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at this interview,'' said Dounia.
<p/>'' '' Will you come?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o'clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said, addressing Razumihin.
<p/>'' Mother, I am inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), too.'' '' Quite right, Dounia. Well, since you have decided,'' added Pulcheria Alexandrovna, <div class="bookquote">``so be it.
<p/>I shall feel easier myself. I do not like concealment and deception. Better let us have the whole truth.... Pyotr Petrovitch may be angry or not, now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IV At that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into the room, looking timidly about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Everyone turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with surprise and curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) yesterday for the first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such a dress, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) memory retained a very different image of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed, almost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but somewhat frightened-looking face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was wearing a very plain indoor dress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) still carried a parasol.
<p/>Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not so much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a little child.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was even about to retreat. '' Oh... it's you!'' said Raskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), too, was confused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) at once recollected that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother and sister knew through Luzhin's letter of <div class="bookquote">``some young woman of notorious behaviour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had only just been protesting against Luzhin's calumny and declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had seen the girl last night for the first time, and suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had walked in.
<p/>All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) brain, but looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more intently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw that the humiliated creature was so humiliated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt suddenly sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had not protested against the expression <div class="bookquote">``of notorious behaviour. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart.
<p/>'' I did not expect you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, hurriedly, with a look that made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stop. '' Please sit down. You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.
<p/>At Sonia's entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of Raskolnikov's three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) to enter.
<p/>Raskolnikov had at first shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) the place on the sofa where Zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) as a bed, was too familiar a place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hurriedly motioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) to Razumihin's chair.
<p/>Allow me--not there. Sit here...'' '' You sit here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said to Razumihin, putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) on the sofa. Sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the two ladies.
<p/>At the thought of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was so frightened that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed Raskolnikov.
<p/>It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could sit down beside them. '' I... I... have come for one minute.
<p/>Forgive me for disturbing you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) began falteringly. '' I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had no one to send.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in the morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)... to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) the honour...
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) told me to beg you...'' Sonia stammered and ceased speaking. '' I will try, certainly, most certainly,'' answered Raskolnikov. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), too, stood up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), too, faltered and could not finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sentence.
<p/>You are perhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) drew up a chair for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>Sonia sat down again, and again timidly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) took a hurried, frightened look at the two ladies, and dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' Please sit down,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, suddenly. '' I want to talk to you. Raskolnikov's pale face flushed, a shudder passed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes glowed.
<p/>Mother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, firmly and insistently, <div class="bookquote">``this is Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run over yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes. In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) embarrassment before Rodya's urgent and challenging look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could not deny herself that satisfaction.
<p/>Dounia gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl's face, and scrutinised her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with perplexity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.
<p/>'' I wanted to ask you,'' said Raskolnikov, hastily, <div class="bookquote">``how things were arranged yesterday. You were not worried by the police, for instance?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death... they did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At the body's remaining so long. You see it is hot now. So that, to-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until to-morrow.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lodgers</b></font>) begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the service, and then to be present at the funeral lunch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div><p/>At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sees herself that it's necessary... '' <div class="bookquote">``To-day, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is giving a funeral lunch?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes... just a little.... She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) told me to thank you very much for helping us yesterday. But for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral.
<p/>'' All at once her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) controlled herself, looking down again. During the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) carefully.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) could not have been called pretty, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such a kindliness and simplicity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) expression that one could not help being attracted.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had a thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a sharp little nose and chin. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) whole figure indeed, had another peculiar characteristic.
<p/>In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eighteen years, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) looked almost a little girl--almost a child. And in some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) gestures, this childishness seemed almost absurd.
<p/>'' But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means? Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) even mean to have a funeral lunch?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov asked, persistently keeping up the conversation. '' The coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, so it won't cost much.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out, so that there will be enough left... and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious it should be so.
<p/>You know one can't... it's a comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)... she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is like that, you know...'' ``I understand, I understand... of course... why do you look at my room like that?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You gave us everything yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a loud rapid whisper; and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked down in confusion.
<p/>My mother has just said it is like a tomb.'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lips and chin were trembling once more. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been struck at once by Raskolnikov's poor surroundings, and now these words broke out spontaneously.
<p/>A silence followed. There was a light in Dounia's eyes, and even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia. <div class="bookquote">``Rodya,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) said, getting up, <div class="bookquote">``we shall have dinner together, of course.
<p/>And you, Rodya, had better go for a little walk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us....
<p/>Come, Dounia.... I am afraid we have exhausted you...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I'll come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) answered, getting up fussily. '' But I have something to see to.''
<p/>'' But surely you will have dinner together? '' cried Razumihin, looking in surprise at Raskolnikov. '' What do you mean?''
<p/>'' Yes, yes, I am coming... of course, of course! And you stay a minute. You do not want him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) just now, do you, mother?
<p/>Or perhaps I am taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) from you?'' '' Oh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining with us?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>added Dounia. Razumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, they were all strangely embarrassed. '' Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet.
<p/>Pulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed to come off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) went in a flutter out of the room.
<p/>I do not like saying good-bye. Good-bye, Nastasya. Ah, I have said good-bye again. '' But Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) turn, and following her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mother out, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow.
<p/>There was a look of poignant discomfort in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face, as though Avdotya Romanovna's courtesy and attention were oppressive and painful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>Sonia, in confusion, gave a hurried, frightened curtsy. '' Dounia, good-bye,'' called Raskolnikov, in the passage. '' Give me your hand.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I did give it to you. Have you forgotten? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>said Dounia, turning warmly and awkwardly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' Never mind, give it to me again.
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) fingers warmly. Dounia smiled, flushed, pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hand away, and went off quite happy. <div class="bookquote">``Come, that's capital,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said to Sonia, going back and looking brightly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>'' God give peace to the dead, the living have still to live. That is right, isn't it?'' Sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) for some moments in silence. The whole history of the dead father floated before his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) memory in those moments...
<p/>**** <div class="bookquote">``Heavens, Dounia,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, as soon as they were in the street, <div class="bookquote">``I really feel relieved myself at coming away--more at ease.
<p/>* How little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be glad of that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I tell you again, mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is still very ill.
<p/>Don't you see it? Perhaps worrying about us upset him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). We must be patient, and much, much can be forgiven. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, you were not very patient!'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up, hotly and jealously. '' Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two.
<p/>You are the very portrait of him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>), and not so much in face as in soul. You are both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both generous....
<p/>Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) can't be an egoist, Dounia. Eh? When I think of what is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't be uneasy, mother. What must be, will be.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dounia, only think what a position we are in! What if Pyotr Petrovitch breaks it off?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out, incautiously. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) won't be worth much if he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) does,'' answered Dounia, sharply and contemptuously.
<p/>'' We did well to come away,'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) was in a hurry about some business or other.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) gets out and has a breath of air... it is fearfully close in his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) room.... But where is one to get a breath of air here?
<p/>The very streets here feel like shut-up rooms. Good heavens! what a town! ... stay... this side... they will crush you--carrying something.
<p/>Why, it is a piano they have got, I declare... how they push!... I am very much afraid of that young woman, too.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What young woman, mother? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sofya Semyonovna/Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov/Marmeladov</b></font>)</div>Why, that Sofya Semyonovna, who was there just now. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have a presentiment, Dounia.
<p/>Well, you may believe it or not, but as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came in, that very minute, I felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was the chief cause of the trouble...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing of the sort!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>cried Dounia, in vexation. '' What nonsense, with your presentiments, mother! He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) only made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) acquaintance the evening before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came in.''
<p/>'' Well, you will see.... She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) worries me; but you will see, you will see! I was so frightened. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was gazing at me with those eyes.
<p/>I could scarcely sit still in my chair when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) began introducing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), do you remember? It seems so strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) introduces her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to us--to you!
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must think a great deal of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``People will write anything. We were talked about and written about, too.
<p/>Have you forgotten? I am sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is a good girl, and that it is all nonsense. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``God grant it may be!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer,'' Dounia snapped out, suddenly. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was crushed; the conversation was not resumed.
<p/>* **** <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you what I want with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>said Raskolnikov, drawing Razumihin to the window. '' Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming,'' Sonia said hurriedly, preparing to depart.
<p/>'' One minute, Sofya Semyonovna. We have no secrets. You are not in our way. I want to have another word or two with you.
<p/>Listen! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned suddenly to Razumihin again. '' You know that... what's his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) name... Porfiry Petrovitch? '' <div class="bookquote">``I should think so!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is a relation. Why? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>added the latter, with interest. '' Is not he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) managing that case... you know, about that murder?...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was inquiring for people who had pawned things, and I have some pledges there, too--trifles--a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when I left home, and my father's silver watch--they are only worth five or six roubles altogether...
<p/>You were speaking about it yesterday.'' '' Yes... well? '' Razumihin's eyes opened wide. '' but I value them. So what am I to do now?
<p/>I do not want to lose the things, especially the watch. I was quaking just now, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Dounia's watch.
<p/>It is the only thing of father's left us. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be ill if it were lost. You know what women are.
<p/>I know I ought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not be better to go straight to Porfiry?
<p/>So tell me what to do. Eh? What do you think? The matter might be settled more quickly. You see, mother may ask for it before dinner.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not to the police station. Certainly to Porfiry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin shouted in extraordinary excitement. '' Well, how glad I am. Let us go at once.
<p/>It is a couple of steps. We shall be sure to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``Very well, let us go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) will be very, very glad to make your acquaintance.
<p/>I have often talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) of you at different times. I was speaking of you yesterday. Let us go. So you knew the old woman?
<p/>So that's it! It is all turning out splendidly.... Oh, yes, Sofya Ivanovna...'' <div class="bookquote">``Sofya Semyonovna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sofya Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>corrected Raskolnikov. '' Sofya Semyonovna, this is my friend Razumihin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is a good man.
<p/>'' '' If you have to go now,'' Sonia was beginning, not looking at Razumihin at all, and still more embarrassed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>decided Raskolnikov. '' I will come to you to-day, Sofya Semyonovna. Only tell me where you live. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was not exactly ill at ease, but seemed hurried, and avoided her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes. Sonia gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) address, and flushed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) did so.
<p/>They all went out together. '' Don't you lock up? '' asked Razumihin, following him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) on to the stairs. '' Never,'' answered Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' I have been meaning to buy a lock for these two years. People are happy who have no need of locks,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, laughing, to Sonia.
<p/>They stood still in the gateway. '' Do you go to the right, Sofya Semyonovna? How did you find me, by the way?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wanted to say something quite different. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wanted to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) soft clear eyes, but this was not easy.
<p/>'' Why, you gave your address to Polenka yesterday.'' <div class="bookquote">``Polenka? Oh, yes; Polenka, that is the little girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is your sister?
<p/>Did I give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the address?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, had you forgotten?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No, I remember. '' <div class="bookquote">``I had heard my father speak of you...
<p/>only I did not know your name, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not know it. And now I came... and as I had learnt your name, I asked to-day, `Where does Mr. Raskolnikov live?'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was extremely glad to escape at last; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went away looking down, hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible, to walk the twenty steps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone, and then moving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to remember, to meditate on every word, every detail.
<p/>I did not know you had only a room too.... Good-bye, I will tell Katerina Ivanovna. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Never, never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) felt anything like this.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) that day, perhaps at once! <div class="bookquote">``Only not to-day, please, not to-day!
<p/>Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was opening before her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) kept muttering with a sinking heart, as though entreating someone, like a frightened child.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) and following at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) heels.
<p/>At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) stood still at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing, started on hearing Sonia's words: <div class="bookquote">``and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov lived?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially upon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted the house.
<p/>All this was done in an instant as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) passed, and trying not to betray his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) interest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walked on more slowly as though waiting for something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy! to me... to that room... he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) will see... oh, dear! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) from the gateway. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was waiting for Sonia; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw that they were parting, and that Sonia was going home.
<p/>'' Home? Where? I've seen that face somewhere,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought. '' I must find out. '' At the turning he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the same way, noticing nothing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) turned the corner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) on the other side. After about fifty paces he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) crossed over again, overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and kept two or three yards behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high shoulders which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) look as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stooped a little.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wore good and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) carried a handsome cane, which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tapped on the pavement at each step; his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gloves were spotless.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with grey, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thick square beard was even lighter than his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had a broad, rather pleasant face with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lips were crimson.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger than his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) years. When Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on the pavement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) dreaminess and preoccupation. On reaching the house where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), seeming rather surprised.
<p/>In the courtyard she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) turned to the right corner. <div class="bookquote">``Bah! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairs behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>Only then Sonia noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) reached the third storey, turned down the passage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed in chalk, <div class="bookquote">``Kapernaumov, Tailor.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bah! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Bah the stranger</b></font>)</div>the stranger repeated again, wondering at the strange coincidence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) rang next door, at No. 8. The doors were two or three yards apart.
<p/>'' You lodge at Kapernaumov's,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said, looking at Sonia and laughing. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am staying close here at Madame Resslich's.
<p/>How odd!'' Sonia looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) attentively. '' We are neighbours,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) went on gaily. '' I only came to town the day before yesterday.
<p/>Good-bye for the present. '' Sonia made no reply; the door opened and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) slipped in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) felt for some reason ashamed and uneasy.
<p/>* **** On the way to Porfiry's, Razumihin was obviously excited. '' That's capital, brother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) repeated several times, <div class="bookquote">``and I am glad!
<p/>I am glad!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' What are you glad about? '' Raskolnikov thought to himself. '' I didn't know that you pledged things at the old woman's, too.
<p/>And... was it long ago? I mean, was it long since you were there?'' '' What a simple-hearted fool he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is!''
<p/>'' When was it? '' Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. '' Two or three days before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) death it must have been.
<p/>But I am not going to redeem the things now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous solicitude about the things.
<p/>'' I've not more than a silver rouble left... after last night's accursed delirium!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) laid special emphasis on the delirium.
<p/>'' Yes, yes,'' Razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear. '' Then that's why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium you were continually mentioning some rings or chains!
<p/>Here this man will go to the stake for me, and I find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) delighted at having it cleared up why I spoke of rings in my delirium!
<p/>Yes, yes... that's clear , it's all clear now.'' '' Hullo! How that idea must have got about among them. What a hold the idea must have on all of them!''
<p/>'' Shall we find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked suddenly. '' Oh, yes,'' Razumihin answered quickly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is a nice fellow, you will see, brother.
<p/>Rather clumsy, that is to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is a man of polished manners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is an intelligent fellow, very much so indeed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) own range of ideas.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) likes to impose on people, or rather to make fun of them.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is the old, circumstantial method.... But he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) understands his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) work... thoroughly.... Last year he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) cleared up a case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is very, very anxious to make your acquaintance!'' <div class="bookquote">``On what grounds is he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) so anxious?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, it's not exactly...
<p/>So, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) heard about you... about your being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) said, `What a pity!'
<p/>And so I concluded... from everything together, not only that; yesterday Zametov... you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense on the way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk...
<p/>you see, since you've been ill I happen to have mentioned you several times.... I am afraid, brother, of your exaggerating it, you see.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What? That they think I am a madman? Maybe they are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) said with a constrained smile. '' Yes, yes....
<p/>That is, pooh, no!... But all that I said -LRB-and there was something else too-RRB- it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense.''
<p/>'' But why are you apologising? I am so sick of it all!'' Raskolnikov cried with exaggerated irritability. It was partly assumed, however.
<p/>'' I know, I know, I understand. Believe me, I understand. One's ashamed to speak of it.'' '' If you are ashamed, then don't speak of it.
<p/>'' Both were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov perceived it with repulsion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was alarmed, too, by what Razumihin had just said about Porfiry.
<p/>I shall have to pull a long face with him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) too,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) thought, with a beating heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) turned white, <div class="bookquote">``and do it naturally, too.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But the most natural thing would be to do nothing at all. Carefully do nothing at all! No, carefully would not be natural again....
<p/>Oh, well, we shall see how it turns out.... We shall see... directly. Is it a good thing to go or not?
<p/>The most important thing, does Porfiry know that I was at the old hag's flat yesterday... and asked about the blood?
<p/>I must find that out instantly, as soon as I go in, find out from his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) face; otherwise... I'll find out, if it's my ruin.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said suddenly, addressing Razumihin, with a sly smile, <div class="bookquote">``I have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously excited.
<p/>The butterfly flies to the light. My heart is beating, that's what's bad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In this grey house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>said Razumihin. '' Isn't it so?''
<p/>Why, you sat on your chair in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be writhing all the time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excited? Not a bit of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>said Razumihin, stung to the quick. '' Yes, brother, I assure you it's noticeable. You kept jumping up for nothing.
<p/>One moment you were angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even blushed; especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed awfully.''
<p/>'' Nothing of the sort, nonsense! What do you mean?'' '' But why are you wriggling out of it, like a schoolboy?
<p/>By Jove, there he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>)'s blushing again. '' <div class="bookquote">``What a pig you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But why are you so shamefaced about it?
<p/>Romeo! Stay, I'll tell of you to-day. Ha-ha-ha! I'll make mother laugh, and someone else, too...'' <div class="bookquote">``Listen, listen, listen, this is serious....
<p/>What next, you fiend! ''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>Razumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold with horror. '' What will you tell them? Come, brother... foo!
<p/>what a pig you are!'' <div class="bookquote">``You are like a summer rose. And if only you knew how it suits you; a Romeo over six foot high!
<p/>And how you've washed to-day--you cleaned your nails, I declare. Eh? That's something unheard of! Why, I do believe you've got pomatum on your hair!
<p/>This is what Raskolnikov wanted: from within they could be heard laughing as they came in, still guffawing in the passage.
<p/>Bend down.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pig!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov laughed as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not restrain himself. So laughing, they entered Porfiry Petrovitch's flat. <div class="bookquote">``Not a word here or I'll... brain you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div><p/>Razumihin whispered furiously, seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder. CHAPTER V Raskolnikov was already entering the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) came in looking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again.
<p/>Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) Razumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony, with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression.
<p/>Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction, bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room looking inquiringly at them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand and shook hands, still apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mirth and utter a few words to introduce himself.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had no sooner succeeded in assuming a serious air and muttering something when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suddenly glanced again as though accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself: his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tried to restrain it.
<p/>The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received this <div class="bookquote">``spontaneous''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most genuine fun and naturalness.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) face and whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified Raskolnikov's laughter. Razumihin strengthened this impression as though on purpose.
<p/>You fiend,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) roared, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) arm which at once struck a little round table with an empty tea-glass on it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fool! Everything was sent flying and crashing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>gentlemen</b></font>)</div>But why break chairs, gentlemen? You know it's a loss to the Crown,'' Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.
<p/>Raskolnikov was still laughing, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand in Porfiry Petrovitch's, but anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a natural end to it.
<p/>Razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the table and smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and turned sharply to the window where he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) stood looking out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) back to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing.
<p/>Zametov had been sitting in the corner, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) rose at the visitors' entrance and was standing in expectation with a smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) lips, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) looked with surprise and even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a certain embarrassment.
<p/>Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but obviously looked for explanations. Zametov's unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov unpleasantly.
<p/>'' I've got to think of that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought. '' Excuse me, please,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began, affecting extreme embarrassment. <div class="bookquote">``Raskolnikov.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, very pleasant to see you... and how pleasantly you've come in....
<p/>Why, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) even say good-morning? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry Petrovitch nodded at Razumihin. '' Upon my honour I don't know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is in such a rage with me.
<p/>I only told him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) as we came along that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was like Romeo... and proved it. And that was all, I think!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pig! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round. '' There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is so furious at the word,'' Porfiry laughed.
<p/>Damn you all!'' snapped Razumihin, and suddenly bursting out laughing himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) went up to Porfiry with a more cheerful face as though nothing had happened.
<p/>This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov; in the first place he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has heard of you and wants to make your acquaintance, and secondly, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has a little matter of business with you.
<p/>'' Oh, you sharp lawyer! ... '' That'll do! We are all fools. To come to business. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here?
<p/>Have you met before? Have you known each other long?'' '' What does this mean?'' thought Raskolnikov uneasily. Zametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.
<p/>'' Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) said easily. '' Then I have been spared the trouble.
<p/>All last week he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) was begging me to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) to you. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out without me.
<p/>Where is your tobacco? '' Porfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and trodden-down slippers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) was a man of about five and thirty, short, stout even to corpulence, and clean shaven.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) hair cut short and had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back. His (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) soft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour, but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression.
<p/>It would have been good-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery, mawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes.
<p/>The expression of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) somewhat womanish figure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at first sight.
<p/>As soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) visitor had a little matter of business with him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) to sit down on the sofa and sat down himself on the other end, waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) business, with that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such exceptional solemnity.
<p/>But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied with himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry.
<p/>Razumihin, sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently, looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive interest.
<p/>You have to give information to the police,'' Porfiry replied, with a most businesslike air, <div class="bookquote">``that having learnt of this incident, that is of the murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such and such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them... or... but they will write to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div><p/>That's just the point, that at the present moment,'' Raskolnikov tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) utmost to feign embarrassment, <div class="bookquote">``I am not quite in funds... and even this trifling sum is beyond me...
<p/>I only wanted, you see, for the present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have money....
<p/>That's no matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pecuniary position coldly, <div class="bookquote">``but you can, if you prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the matter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Porfiry Petrovitch did not once take his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov swore to himself. '' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``On an ordinary sheet of paper?
<p/>Oh, the most ordinary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with obvious irony at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), screwing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes and, as it were, winking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>'' Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again interested in the financial side of the question. '' But perhaps it was Raskolnikov's fancy, for it all lasted but a moment.
<p/>There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could have sworn he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) winked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), goodness knows why. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knows,'' flashed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind like lightning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive my troubling you about such trifles,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went on, a little disconcerted, <div class="bookquote">``the things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must confess that I was alarmed when I heard...
<p/>That's why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that Porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!
<p/>Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with a flash of vindictive anger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) black eyes, but immediately recollected himself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' Razumihin put in with obvious intention. This was really unbearable. '' You seem to be jeering at me, brother?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), with a well-feigned irritability.
<p/>I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious about such trash; but you mustn't think me selfish or grasping for that, and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes.
<p/>I told you just now that the silver watch, though it's not worth a cent, is the only thing left us of my father's.
<p/>You may laugh at me, but my mother is here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turned suddenly to Porfiry, <div class="bookquote">``and if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turned again hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) voice tremble, <div class="bookquote">``that the watch was lost, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be in despair!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>You know what women are!'' <div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it! I didn't mean that at all! Quite the contrary! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>shouted Razumihin distressed.
<p/>'' Was it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it? '' Raskolnikov asked himself in a tremor. '' Why did I say that about women?''
<p/>'' Oh, your mother is with you?'' Porfiry Petrovitch inquired. '' Yes.'' <div class="bookquote">``When did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) come?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Last night. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry paused as though reflecting.
<p/>'' Your things would not in any case be lost,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went on calmly and coldly. '' I have been expecting you here for some time.
<p/>And as though that was a matter of no importance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) carefully offered the ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash over the carpet.
<p/>'' Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), and was still concerned with Razumihin's cigarette. <div class="bookquote">``What?
<p/>Expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)? Why, did you know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had pledges there ?''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>cried Razumihin. Porfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov. ''
<p/>Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on the paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the date on which you left them with her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>)...
<p/>Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) very utmost to look him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) straight in the face, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) failed, and suddenly added: <div class="bookquote">``I say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges... that it must be difficult to remember them all...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How observant you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But you remember them all so clearly, and... and... '' <div class="bookquote">``Stupid! Feeble! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought. ''
<p/>But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn't come forward,'' Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony.
<p/>Why did I add that?'' '' '' I haven't been quite well. '' <div class="bookquote">``I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress about something.
<p/>You look pale still.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am not pale at all.... No, I am quite well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov snapped out rudely and angrily, completely changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tone.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) anger was mounting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not repress it. '' And in my anger I shall betray myself,'' flashed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind again.
<p/>'' Why are they torturing me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not quite well! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) up. '' What next! He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was unconscious and delirious all yesterday.
<p/>Would you believe, Porfiry, as soon as our backs were turned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) dressed, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) could hardly stand, and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight, delirious all the time!
<p/>Would you believe it! Extraordinary!'' <div class="bookquote">``Really delirious? You don't say so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) head in a womanish way. <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! Don't you believe it!
<p/>But you don't believe it anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov let slip in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) anger. But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem to catch those strange words.
<p/>'' But how could you have gone out if you hadn't been delirious? '' Razumihin got hot suddenly. '' What did you go out for?
<p/>What was the object of it? And why on the sly? Were you in your senses when you did it? Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly.
<p/>Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, <div class="bookquote">``I ran away from them to take lodgings where they wouldn't find me, and took a lot of money with me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was awfully sick of them yesterday. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Zametov/Mr. Zametov</b></font>)</div>Mr. Zametov there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or delirious yesterday; settle our dispute.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) expression and his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) silence to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>). '' In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were extremely irritable,'' Zametov pronounced dryly.
<p/>And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day,'' put in Porfiry Petrovitch, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had been run over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' And there,'' said Razumihin, <div class="bookquote">``weren't you mad then? You gave your last penny to the widow for the funeral.
<p/>If you wanted to help, give fifteen or twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) flung away all the twenty-five at once!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it? So that's why I was liberal yesterday.... Mr. Zametov knows I've found a treasure!
<p/>Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour with such trivialities,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with trembling lips.
<p/>'' We are boring you, aren't we?'' '' Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only you knew how you interest me!
<p/>It's interesting to look on and listen... and I am really glad you have come forward at last.'' '' But you might give us some tea!
<p/>My throat's dry,'' cried Razumihin. '' Capital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. Wouldn't you like... something more essential before tea?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get along with you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea. Raskolnikov's thoughts were in a whirl. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was in terrible exasperation.
<p/>'' The worst of it is they don't disguise it; they don't care to stand on ceremony! And how if you didn't know me at all, did you come to talk to Nikodim Fomitch about me?
<p/>So they don't care to hide that they are tracking me like a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was shaking with rage. <div class="bookquote">``Come, strike me openly, don't play with me like a cat with a mouse. It's hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps I won't allow it!
<p/>I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly faces, and you'll see how I despise you. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could hardly breathe. '' And what if it's only my fancy? What if I am mistaken, and through inexperience I get angry and don't keep up my nasty part?
<p/>Perhaps it's all unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there is something about them.... It all might be said, but there is something.
<p/>Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) say bluntly, `With her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'? Why did Zametov add that I spoke artfully? Why do they speak in that tone?
<p/>Yes, the tone.... Razumihin is sitting here, why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) see nothing? That innocent blockhead never does see anything! Feverish again!
<p/>Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of course it's nonsense! What could he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) wink for? Are they trying to upset my nerves or are they teasing me?
<p/>Either it's ill fancy or they know! Even Zametov is rude.... Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) mind. I foresaw he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) would change his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) mind!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) is at home here, while it's my first visit. Porfiry does not consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) a visitor; sits with his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>).
<p/>They're as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt they were talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat?
<p/>If only they'd make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) let it pass.... I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use afterwards....
<p/>Delirious, indeed... ha-ha-ha! He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) knows all about last night! He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) didn't know of my mother's arrival! The hag had written the date on in pencil!
<p/>You are wrong, you won't catch me! There are no facts... it's all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isn't a fact but delirium.
<p/>I know what to say to them.... Do they know about the flat? I won't go without finding out. What did I come for?
<p/>But my being angry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! Perhaps that's right; to play the invalid....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>) is feeling me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>) will try to catch me. Why did I come? '' All this flashed like lightning through his (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Porfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>) became suddenly more jovial. '' Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather.... And I am out of sorts altogether,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>) began in quite a different tone, laughing to Razumihin.
<p/>'' Was it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most interesting point. Who got the best of it?'' '' Oh, no one, of course.
<p/>They got on to everlasting questions, floated off into space.'' <div class="bookquote">``Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Whether there is such a thing as crime.
<p/>I told you that we talked our heads off.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What is there strange? It's an everyday social question,'' Raskolnikov answered casually.
<p/>'' The question wasn't put quite like that,'' observed Porfiry. '' Not quite, that's true,'' Razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and hurried as usual.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to hear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to help me.
<p/>You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing more; no other causes admitted!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are wrong there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) was noticeably animated and kept laughing as he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) looked at Razumihin, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) more excited than ever.
<p/>I told them you were coming.... It began with the socialist doctrine. '' Nothing is admitted,'' Razumihin interrupted with heat. ''
<p/>I am not wrong. I'll show you their pamphlets. Everything with them is `the influence of environment,' and nothing else. Their favourite phrase!
<p/>From which it follows that, if society is normally organised, all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant.
<p/>They don't recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker than any living process!
<p/>Human nature is not taken into account, it is excluded, it's not supposed to exist! That's why they instinctively dislike history, `nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,' and they explain it all as stupidity!
<p/>The living soul demands life, the soul won't obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde!
<p/>But what they want though it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and won't revolt!
<p/>And it comes in the end to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning of rooms and passages in a phalanstery!
<p/>The phalanstery is ready, indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--it wants life, it hasn't completed its vital process, it's too soon for the graveyard!
<p/>That's why they so dislike the living process of life; they don't want a living soul ! You can't skip over nature by logic.
<p/>Logic presupposes three possibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce it all to the question of comfort!
<p/>That's the easiest solution of the problem! It's seductively clear and you musn't think about it. That's the great thing, you mustn't think!
<p/>The whole secret of life in two pages of print!'' <div class="bookquote">``Now he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) is off, beating the drum! Catch hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>laughed Porfiry.
<p/>Can you imagine,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) turned to Raskolnikov, <div class="bookquote">``six people holding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as a preliminary!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>No, brother, you are wrong, environment accounts for a great deal in crime; I can assure you of that.'' ''
<p/>Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty violates a child of ten; was it environment drove him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to it?''
<p/>Well, strictly speaking, it did,'' Porfiry observed with noteworthy gravity; <div class="bookquote">``a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the influence of environment.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>'' Razumihin was almost in a frenzy. '' Oh, if you like,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) roared. '' I'll prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the Church of Ivan
<p/>the Great's being two hundred and fifty feet high, and I will prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal tendency!
<p/>I undertake to! Will you bet on it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Done! Let's hear, please, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) will prove it!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) is always humbugging, confound him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>),'' cried Razumihin, jumping up and gesticulating.
<p/>'' What's the use of talking to you? He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) does all that on purpose; you don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), Rodion! He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) took their side yesterday, simply to make fools of them.
<p/>And the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) said yesterday! And they were delighted! He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) persuaded us that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was going into a monastery: he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) stuck to it for two months.
<p/>Not long ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) head to declare he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was going to get married, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had everything ready for the wedding.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) ordered new clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>). There was no bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are wrong!
<p/>I got the clothes before. It was the new clothes in fact that made me think of taking you in.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you such a good dissembler?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><p/>Raskolnikov asked carelessly. '' You wouldn't have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I shall take you in, too. Ha-ha-ha! No, I'll tell you the truth.
<p/>All these questions about crime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yours which interested me at the time. '
<p/>On Crime'... or something of the sort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the Periodical Review .
<p/>I certainly did write an article upon a book six months ago when I left the university, but I sent it to the Weekly Review .''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``My article? In the Periodical Review ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov asked in astonishment. '' '' But it came out in the Periodical .''
<p/>That's true; but when it ceased to exist, the Weekly Review was amalgamated with the Periodical , and so your article appeared two months ago in the latter.
<p/>'' And the Weekly Review ceased to exist, so that's why it wasn't printed at the time. '' '' Didn't you know?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov had not known. '' Why, you might get some money out of them for the article! What a strange person you are!
<p/>You lead such a solitary life that you know nothing of matters that concern you directly. It's a fact, I assure you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo, Rodya! I knew nothing about it either!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried Razumihin. '' I'll run to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number.
<p/>Two months ago? What was the date? It doesn't matter though, I will find it. Think of not telling us!'' <div class="bookquote">``How did you find out that the article was mine?
<p/>It's only signed with an initial.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the editor; I know him (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>)....
<p/>I was very much interested.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Very, very original, but... it was not that part of your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of the article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working it out clearly.
<p/>There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are certain persons who can... that is, not precisely are able to, but have a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the law is not for them.''
<p/>Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness. Raskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) idea.
<p/>'' What? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not because of the influence of environment? '' Razumihin inquired with some alarm even.
<p/>'' No, not exactly because of it,'' answered Porfiry. '' In his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) article all men are divided into `ordinary' and `extraordinary.'
<p/>Ordinary men have to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because, don't you see, they are ordinary.
<p/>But extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they are extraordinary.
<p/>That was your idea, if I am not mistaken?'' '' What do you mean? That can't be right? '' Razumihin muttered in bewilderment.
<p/>Raskolnikov smiled again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw the point at once, and knew where they wanted to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) decided to take up the challenge.
<p/>'' That wasn't quite my contention,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began simply and modestly. '' Yet I admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like, perfectly so.
<p/>The only difference is that I don't contend that extraordinary people are always bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it.
<p/>'' -LRB-It almost gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pleasure to admit this.-RRB- '' In fact, I doubt whether such an argument could be published.
<p/>I simply hinted that an `extraordinary' man has the right... that is not an official right, but an inner right to decide in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own conscience to overstep... certain obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) idea -LRB-sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity-RRB-.
<p/>You say that my article isn't definite; I am ready to make it as clear as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well.
<p/>I maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a hundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have been in duty-bound... to eliminate the dozen or the hundred men for the sake of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) discoveries known to the whole of humanity.
<p/>But it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people right and left and to steal every day in the market.
<p/>Then, I remember, I maintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men, such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either, if that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence of ancient law--were of use to their cause.
<p/>In short, I maintain that all great men or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving some new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less, of course.
<p/>Otherwise it's hard for them to get out of the common rut; and to remain in the common rut is what they can't submit to, from their very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to it.
<p/>It's remarkable, in fact, that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible carnage. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that.
<p/>As for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that it's somewhat arbitrary, but I don't insist upon exact numbers.
<p/>I only believe in my leading idea that men are in general divided by a law of nature into two categories, inferior -LRB-ordinary-RRB-, that is, so to say, material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have the gift or the talent to utter a new word .
<p/>The same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. There are, of course, innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both categories are fairly well marked.
<p/>The first category, generally speaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live under control and love to be controlled.
<p/>To my thinking it is their duty to be controlled, because that's their vocation, and there is nothing humiliating in it for them.
<p/>The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied; for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake of the better.
<p/>But if such a one is forced for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) can, I maintain, find within himself, in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) conscience, a sanction for wading through blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that.
<p/>It's only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article -LRB-you remember it began with the legal question-RRB-.
<p/>There's no need for such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right, they punish them or hang them -LRB-more or less-RRB-, and in doing so fulfil quite justly their conservative vocation.
<p/>The second category all transgress the law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their capacities. But the same masses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them -LRB-more or less-RRB-.
<p/>The first category is always the man of the present, the second the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the second move the world and lead it to its goal.
<p/>Each class has an equal right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me--and vive la guerre éternelle --till the New Jerusalem, of course!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said these words and during the whole preceding tirade he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes on one spot on the carpet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>'' And... and do you believe in God? Excuse my curiosity. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>repeated Raskolnikov, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes to Porfiry. '' And... do you believe in Lazarus' rising from the dead?'' <div class="bookquote">``I...
<p/>I do. Why do you ask all this?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You believe it literally?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Literally.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't say so.... I asked from curiosity.
<p/>Excuse me. But let us go back to the question; they are not always executed. Some, on the contrary... ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Triumph in their lifetime?
<p/>Oh, yes, some attain their ends in this life, and then...''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>'' They begin executing other people?'' '' If it's necessary; indeed, for the most part they do.
<p/>Your remark is very witty.'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary people from the ordinary ones?
<p/>Excuse the natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn't they adopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn't they wear something, be branded in some way?
<p/>For you know if confusion arises and a member of one category imagines that he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) belongs to the other, begins to `eliminate obstacles' as you so happily expressed it, then...''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Are there signs at their birth? I feel there ought to be more exactitude, more external definition. '' Oh, that very often happens!
<p/>No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in the first category, that is among the ordinary people -LRB-as I perhaps unfortunately called them-RRB-.
<p/>In spite of their predisposition to obedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes vouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people, `destroyers,' and to push themselves into the `new movement,' and this quite sincerely.
<p/>That remark is wittier than the other.'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>'' Meanwhile the really new people are very often unobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling tendencies.
<p/>But I don't think there is any considerable danger here, and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far.
<p/>Of course, they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away with them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even this isn't necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very conscientious: some perform this service for one another and others chastise themselves with their own hands....
<p/>They will impose various public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying effect; in fact you've nothing to be uneasy about....
<p/>It's a law of nature.'' '' Well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but there's another thing worries me.
<p/>I am ready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it's alarming if there are a great many of them, eh?''
<p/>Tell me, please, are there many people who have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people? '' Oh, you needn't worry about that either,'' Raskolnikov went on in the same tone.
<p/>People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for saying something new , are extremely few in number, extraordinarily so in fact.
<p/>One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity some law of nature.
<p/>That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am convinced that it exists, and one day may become known.
<p/>The vast mass of mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort, by some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence.
<p/>'' One in ten thousand perhaps-- I speak roughly, approximately--is born with some independence, and with still greater independence one in a hundred thousand.
<p/>The man of genius is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity, appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions.
<p/>In fact I have not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there certainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of chance.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, are you both joking? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin cried at last. '' There you sit, making fun of one another. Are you serious, Rodya?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pale and almost mournful face and made no reply. And the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and discourteous sarcasm of Porfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.
<p/>Well, brother, if you are really serious... You are right, of course, in saying that it's not new, that it's like what we've read and heard a thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed in the name of conscience , and, excuse my saying so, with such fanaticism...
<p/>'' That, I take it, is the point of your article. But that sanction of bloodshed by conscience is to my mind... more terrible than the official, legal sanction of bloodshed...''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite right, it is more terrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>the official sanction</b></font>)</div>Porfiry agreed. '' Yes, you must have exaggerated! There is some mistake, I shall read it.
<p/>You can't think that! I shall read it.'' '' All that is not in the article, there's only a hint of it,'' said Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' Yes, yes. '' Porfiry couldn't sit still. '' Your attitude to crime is pretty clear to me now, but... excuse me for my impertinence
<p/>-LRB-I am really ashamed to be worrying you like this-RRB-, you see, you've removed my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but... there are various practical possibilities that make me uneasy!
<p/>What if some man or youth imagines that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a Lycurgus or Mahomet--a future one of course--and suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begins to remove all obstacles....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has some great enterprise before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and needs money for it... and tries to get it... do you see? ''
<p/>Zametov gave a sudden guffaw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) corner. Raskolnikov did not even raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' I must admit,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went on calmly, <div class="bookquote">``that such cases certainly must arise.
<p/>The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that snare; young people especially. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you see. Well then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov smiled in reply; <div class="bookquote">``that's not my fault. So it is and so it always will be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said just now -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) nodded at Razumihin-RRB- that I sanction bloodshed.
<p/>Society is too well protected by prisons, banishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude. There's no need to be uneasy. You have but to catch the thief.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And what if we do catch him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) gets what he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) deserves. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are certainly logical. But what of his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) conscience?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you care about that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Simply from humanity. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' If he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) has a conscience he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) will suffer for his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) mistake.
<p/>That will be his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) punishment--as well as the prison.'' '' But the real geniuses,'' asked Razumihin frowning, <div class="bookquote">``those who have the right to murder?
<p/>Oughtn't they to suffer at all even for the blood they've shed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why the word ought ? It's not a matter of permission or prohibition.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) will suffer if he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is sorry for his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) victim. Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart.
<p/>The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) added dreamily, not in the tone of the conversation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) cap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was too quiet by comparison with his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) manner at his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) entrance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) felt this.
<p/>Everyone got up. '' Well, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like,'' Porfiry Petrovitch began again, <div class="bookquote">``but I can't resist.
<p/>Allow me one little question -LRB- I know I am troubling you-RRB-. There is just one little notion I want to express, simply that I may not forget it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, tell me your little notion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov stood waiting, pale and grave before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' Well, you see... I really don't know how to express it properly....
<p/>When you were writing your article, surely you couldn't have helped, he-he! fancying yourself... just a little, an `extraordinary' man, uttering a new word in your sense....
<p/>And, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties and hardship or for some service to humanity--to overstep obstacles?...
<p/>It's a playful, psychological idea.... That's so, isn't it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Quite possibly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov answered contemptuously. Razumihin made a movement. '' For instance, to rob and murder?
<p/>'' And again he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) winked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) left eye, and laughed noiselessly just as before. '' If I did I certainly should not tell you,'' Raskolnikov answered with defiant and haughty contempt.
<p/>'' No, I was only interested on account of your article, from a literary point of view...'' <div class="bookquote">``Foo! how obvious and insolent that is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me to observe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) answered dryly, <div class="bookquote">``that I don't consider myself a Mahomet or a Napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not being one of them I cannot tell you how I should act.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Raskolnikov thought with repulsion. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, come, don't we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.
<p/>Something peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) voice. '' Perhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did for Alyona Ivanovna last week?
<p/>'' Zametov blurted out from the corner. Raskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry. Razumihin was scowling gloomily.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) seemed before this to be noticing something. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) looked angrily around. There was a minute of gloomy silence. Raskolnikov turned to go.
<p/>'' Are you going already? '' Porfiry said amiably, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand with excessive politeness. '' Very, very glad of your acquaintance.
<p/>As for your request, have no uneasiness, write just as I told you, or, better still, come to me there yourself in a day or two... to-morrow, indeed.
<p/>As one of the last to be there , you might perhaps be able to tell us something,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added with a most good-natured expression.
<p/>I shall be there at eleven o'clock for certain. We'll arrange it all; we'll have a talk. '' You want to cross-examine me officially in due form?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov asked sharply. '' Oh, why? That's not necessary for the present. You misunderstand me. I lose no opportunity, you see, and...
<p/>I've talked with all who had pledges.... I obtained evidence from some of them, and you are the last.... Yes, by the way,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, <div class="bookquote">``I just remember, what was I thinking of?
<p/>of course, I know, I know very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned to Raskolnikov, <div class="bookquote">``that the fellow is innocent, but what is one to do?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned to Razumihin, <div class="bookquote">``you were talking my ears off about that Nikolay... We had to trouble Dmitri too.... This is the point, this is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) spoke that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) need not have said it. ''
<p/>Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn't you see in a flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember?
<p/>two workmen or at least one of them? They were painting there, didn't you notice them? It's very, very important for them.''
<p/>No, I didn't see them,'' Raskolnikov answered slowly, as though ransacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) memory, while at the same instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was racking every nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Painters? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>No, I didn't see them, and I don't think I noticed a flat like that open.... But on the fourth storey'' -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had mastered the trap now and was triumphant-RRB-
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona Ivanovna's.... I remember... I remember it clearly. Some porters were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall.
<p/>no, I don't remember that there were any painters, and I don't think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn't.
<p/>Why, it was on the day of the murder the painters were at work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was there three days before?
<p/>But painters... ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' What do you mean? '' Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had reflected and realised. '' What are you asking?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Foo! I have muddled it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead. '' Deuce take it! This business is turning my brain!''
<p/>It would be such a great thing for us to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at the flat, so I fancied you could perhaps have told us something....
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) addressed Raskolnikov somewhat apologetically. '' I quite muddled it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then you should be more careful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin observed grimly. The last words were uttered in the passage.
<p/>Porfiry Petrovitch saw them to the door with excessive politeness. They went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps they did not say a word.
<p/>Raskolnikov drew a deep breath. CHAPTER VI <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it, I can't believe it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>repeated Razumihin, trying in perplexity to refute Raskolnikov's arguments.
<p/>Razumihin kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about it .
<p/>They were by now approaching Bakaleyev's lodgings, where Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while. '' Don't believe it, then!'' answered Raskolnikov, with a cold, careless smile.
<p/>That is why you weighed their words... h'm... certainly, I agree, Porfiry's tone was rather strange, and still more that wretch Zametov!...
<p/>'' You were noticing nothing as usual, but I was weighing every word. '' <div class="bookquote">``You are suspicious. You are right, there was something about him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>)--but why?
<p/>If they had that brainless idea, they would do their utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch you afterwards....
<p/>Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) has changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) mind since last night. '' <div class="bookquote">``Quite the contrary! But it was all impudent and careless.
<p/>If they had had facts--I mean, real facts--or at least grounds for suspicion, then they would certainly have tried to hide their game, in the hope of getting more -LRB-they would have made a search long ago besides-RRB-.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But they have no facts, not one. It is all mirage--all ambiguous. Simply a floating idea. So they try to throw me out by impudence.
<p/>And perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was irritated at having no facts, and blurted it out in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) vexation--or perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has some plan... he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seems an intelligent man.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wanted to frighten me by pretending to know. They have a psychology of their own, brother. But it is loathsome explaining it all.
<p/>Stop!'' '' And it's insulting, insulting! I understand you. But... since we have spoken openly now -LRB-and it is an excellent thing that we have at last--I am glad-RRB-
<p/>I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago, this idea. Of course the merest hint only--an insinuation--but why an insinuation even?
<p/>Simply because a poor student, unhinged by poverty and hypochondria, on the eve of a severe delirious illness -LRB-note that-RRB-, suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul to speak to for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has to face some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; and the unexpected debt thrust under his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) nose, the I.O.U. presented by Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees Reaumur and a stifling atmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a person where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tchebarov</b></font>) had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tchebarov</b></font>) might well have a fainting fit!
<p/>How dare they? What foundation have they? If only you knew how furious I have been. Think only! And that, that is what they found it all on!
<p/>I understand how annoying it is, but in your place, Rodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit in their ugly faces, and spit a dozen times in all directions.
<p/>Damn them! I'd hit out in all directions, neatly too, and so I'd put an end to it. Damn them! Don't be downhearted.
<p/>It's a shame!'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) really has put it well, though,'' Raskolnikov thought. '' Damn them? But the cross-examination again, to-morrow?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said with bitterness.
<p/>'' Must I really enter into explanations with them? I feel vexed as it is, that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the restaurant...''
<p/>I will squeeze it out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>), as one of the family: he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) must let me know the ins and outs of it all!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn it! I will go myself to Porfiry. And as for Zametov...''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) sees through him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>thought Raskolnikov. <div class="bookquote">``Stay!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>cried Razumihin, seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) by the shoulder again. '' Stay! you were wrong. I have thought it out. You are wrong!
<p/>But if you had done that , could you have said you had seen them painting the flat... and the workmen?
<p/>How was that a trap? You say that the question about the workmen was a trap. On the contrary, you would have seen nothing, even if you had seen it.
<p/>If I had done that thing , I should certainly have said that I had seen the workmen and the flat,'' Raskolnikov answered, with reluctance and obvious disgust.
<p/>Who would own it against himself?'' '' '' But why speak against yourself? '' <div class="bookquote">``Because only peasants, or the most inexperienced novices deny everything flatly at examinations.
<p/>If a man is ever so little developed and experienced, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will certainly try to admit all the external facts that can't be avoided, but will seek other explanations of them, will introduce some special, unexpected turn, that will give them another significance and put them in another light.
<p/>Porfiry might well reckon that I should be sure to answer so, and say I had seen them to give an air of truth, and then make some explanation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been there two days before, and that therefore you must have been there on the day of the murder at eight o'clock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that is what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was reckoning on, that I should not have time to reflect, and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer, and so would forget that the workmen could not have been there two days before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have caught you over a detail.'' '' But how could you forget it?'' '' Nothing easier.
<p/>It is in just such stupid things clever people are most easily caught. The more cunning a man is, the less he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suspects that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be caught in a simple thing.
<p/>The more cunning a man is, the simpler the trap he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be caught in. Porfiry is not such a fool as you think....
<p/>But at the very moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was struck by the strangeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own frankness, and the eagerness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made this explanation, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had kept up all the preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive, from necessity.
<p/>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a knave then, if that is so!'' Raskolnikov could not help laughing. '' I am getting a relish for certain aspects!
<p/>But almost at the same instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) became suddenly uneasy, as though an unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought to himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) uneasiness kept on increasing. They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev's. '' Go in alone!'' said Raskolnikov suddenly.
<p/>'' I will be back directly. '' <div class="bookquote">``Where are you going? Why, we are just here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it....
<p/>I will come in half an hour. Tell them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Say what you like, I will come with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You, too, want to torture me!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at Raskolnikov striding rapidly away in the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lodging.
<p/>At last, gritting his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) teeth and clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fist, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) swore he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would squeeze Porfiry like a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) screamed, with such bitter irritation, such despair in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes that Razumihin's hands dropped. When Raskolnikov got home, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hair was soaked with sweat and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was breathing heavily.
<p/>Then in senseless terror he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had put the things; put his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the hole, in every crack and fold of the paper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went rapidly up the stairs, walked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) unlocked room and at once fastened the latch. Finding nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) got up and drew a deep breath.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was reaching the steps of Bakaleyev's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paper in which they had been wrapped with the old woman's handwriting on it, might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and then might suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half senseless smile strayed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cap at last and went quietly out of the room.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) ideas were all tangled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went dreamily through the gateway. '' Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is himself,'' shouted a loud voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head.
<p/>The porter was standing at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) little room and was pointing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat and a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman.
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wrinkled flabby face he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked over fifty; his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) little eyes were lost in fat and they looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stooped, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head in a greasy cap hung forward. '' What is it? '' Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.
<p/>The man stole a look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brows and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attentively, deliberately; then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned slowly and went out of the gate into the street without saying a word.
<p/>'' What is it?'' cried Raskolnikov. '' Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your name and whom you lodged with.
<p/>The porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and after wondering for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) turned and went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) room.
<p/>Raskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walking along the other side of the street with the same even, deliberate step with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes fixed on the ground, as though in meditation.
<p/>I saw you coming and pointed you out and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went away. It's funny. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) soon overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), but for some time walked behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>The man noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quickly, but dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes again; and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.
<p/>At last, moving on to a level with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. '' You were inquiring for me... of the porter?''
<p/>Raskolnikov said at last, but in a curiously quiet voice. The man made no answer; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't even look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Again they were both silent. '' Why do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... What's the meaning of it?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov's voice broke and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) seemed unable to articulate the words clearly. The man raised his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at Raskolnikov.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) legs felt suddenly weak, a cold shiver ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) spine, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart seemed to stand still for a moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free.
<p/>'' Murderer!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Murderer</b></font>) said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice. Raskolnikov went on walking beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). So they walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.
<p/>The man did not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' What do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer? '' muttered Raskolnikov hardly audibly.
<p/>You are a murderer,'' the man answered still more articulately and emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked straight into Raskolnikov's pale face and stricken eyes.
<p/>'' They had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the left without looking behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turn round fifty paces away and look back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) still standing there. With slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) way back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) little garret, feeling chilled all over.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cap and put it on the table, and for ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood without moving. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stretched himself on it.
<p/>Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some images without order or coherence floated before his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind--faces of people he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) childhood or met somewhere once, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would never have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite dark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the Sunday bells floating in from somewhere....
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lay for half an hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought of nothing. The images followed one another, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) liked and tried to clutch at, but they faded and
<p/>all the while there was an oppression within him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even pleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted, but that too was an almost pleasant sensation.
<p/>Razumihin opened the door and stood for some time in the doorway as though hesitating, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) stepped softly into the room and went cautiously to the sofa.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) eyes and pretended to be asleep. Raskolnikov heard Nastasya's whisper: <div class="bookquote">``Don't disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)!
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) can have his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) dinner later. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Nastasya</b></font>)</div>'' Quite so,'' answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully and closed the door.
<p/>Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes, turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) back again, clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head. '' Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)?
<p/>Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? Where was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) , what did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) see? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has seen it all, that's clear.
<p/>Where was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then? And from where did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) see? Why has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only now sprung out of the earth? And how could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) see?
<p/>Is it possible? Hm... '' continued Raskolnikov, turning cold and shivering, <div class="bookquote">``and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the door--was that possible?
<p/>A clue? You miss an infinitesimal line and you can build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it!
<p/>Is it possible?''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had become. '' I ought to have known it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought with a bitter smile.
<p/>'' And how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up an axe and shed blood! I ought to have known beforehand....
<p/>Ah, but I did know! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) whispered in despair. At times he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) came to a standstill at some thought. ''
<p/>The real Master to whom all is permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, forgets an army in Egypt, wastes half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off with a jest at Vilna.
<p/>No, those men are not made so. And altars are set up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) death, and so all is permitted.
<p/>Napoleon, the pyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with a red trunk under her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bed--it's a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to digest!
<p/>No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but of bronze!'' One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) laugh. How can they digest it!
<p/>It's too inartistic. '' A Napoleon creep under an old woman's bed! Ugh, how loathsome! '' At moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) was raving.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) sank into a state of feverish excitement. '' The old woman is of no consequence,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) thought, hotly and incoherently.
<p/>'' The old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is not what matters! The old woman was only an illness....
<p/>I was in a hurry to overstep.... I didn't kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the principle, but I didn't overstep, I stopped on this side....
<p/>I was only capable of killing. And it seems I wasn't even capable of that... Principle? Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists?
<p/>They are industrious, commercial people; `the happiness of all' is their case. No, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I don't want to wait for `the happiness of all.'
<p/>I simply couldn't pass by my mother starving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the `happiness of all.'
<p/>I want to live myself, or else better not live at all. I am putting my little brick into the happiness of all
<p/>and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I only live once, I too want....
<p/>Yes, I am certainly a louse,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playing with it with vindictive pleasure.
<p/>In the first place, because I can reason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble object--ha-ha!
<p/>Ech, I am an æsthetic louse and nothing more,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) added suddenly, laughing like a madman. '' '' Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as possible, weighing, measuring and calculating.
<p/>Of all the lice I picked out the most useless one and proposed to take from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) only as much as I needed for the first step, no more nor less -LRB-so the rest would have gone to a monastery, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) will, ha-ha!-RRB-.
<p/>And what shows that I am utterly a louse,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) added, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) teeth, <div class="bookquote">``is that I am perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed, and I felt beforehand that I should tell myself so after killing her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>Can anything be compared with the horror of that? The vulgarity! The abjectness! I understand the `prophet' with his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) sabre, on his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) steed: Allah commands and `trembling' creation must obey!
<p/>The `prophet' is right, he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) is right when he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) sets a battery across the street and blows up the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain!
<p/>It's for you to obey, trembling creation, and not to have desires , for that's not for you! ... I shall never, never forgive the old woman!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) hair was soaked with sweat, his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) quivering lips were parched, his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) eyes were fixed on the ceiling. '' Mother, sister--how I loved them!
<p/>Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate them, I feel a physical hatred for them, I can't bear them near me....
<p/>I went up to my mother and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), I remember.... To embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and think if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only knew... shall I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) then?
<p/>That's just what I might do.... She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must be the same as I am,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) added, straining himself to think, as it were struggling with delirium.
<p/>'' Ah, how I hate the old woman now! I feel I should kill her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came to life!
<p/>Poor Lizaveta! Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) come in?... It's strange though, why is it I scarcely ever think of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), as though I hadn't killed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?
<p/>Lizaveta! Sonia! Poor gentle things, with gentle eyes.... Dear women! Why don't they weep? Why don't they moan? They give up everything... their eyes are soft and gentle....
<p/>Sonia, Sonia! Gentle Sonia! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) didn't remember how he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) got into the street.
<p/>The twilight had fallen and the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a peculiar breathlessness in the air.
<p/>There were crowds of people in the street; workmen and business people were making their way home; other people had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and stagnant water.
<p/>Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do something in a hurry, but what it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had forgotten.
<p/>It was late evening. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street, beckoning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) crossed over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), but at once the man turned and walked away with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head hanging, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made no sign to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was within ten paces he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long coat.
<p/>Raskolnikov followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) at a distance; his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart was beating; they went down a turning; the man still did not look round.
<p/>'' Stay, did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really beckon? '' Raskolnikov wondered, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tried to overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) know I am following him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)?'' thought Raskolnikov.
<p/>The man went into the gateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would look round and sign to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>In the court-yard the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Raskolnikov at once followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) into the yard, but the man was gone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have gone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heard slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely familiar.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) reached the second floor.
<p/>Bah! this is the flat where the painters were at work... but how was it he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not recognise it at once?
<p/>The steps of the man above had died away. '' So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have stopped or hidden somewhere. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached the third storey, should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go on?
<p/>There was a stillness that was dreadful.... But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on. The sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own footsteps scared and frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>How dark it was! The man must be hiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hesitated and went in.
<p/>It was very dark and empty in the passage, as though everything had been removed; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crept on tiptoe into the parlour which was flooded with moonlight.
<p/>Everything there was as before, the chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the frames. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more silent the moonlight, the more violently his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart beat, till it was painful.
<p/>'' It's the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,'' thought Raskolnikov. And still the same hush. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heard a momentary sharp crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again.
<p/>At that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) noticed in the corner between the window and the little cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall.
<p/>A fly flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. '' Why is that cloak here? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``it wasn't there before....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cautiously moved the cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent double so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) couldn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face; but it was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went up to it quietly and felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is afraid,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stealthily took the axe from the noose and struck her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) one blow, then another on the skull.
<p/>But strange to say she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not stir, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were made of wood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), too, bent her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head lower.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) bent right down to the ground and peeped up into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face from below, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) peeped and turned cold with horror: the old woman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) utmost that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) should not hear it.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fancied that the door from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and whispering within.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was overcome with frenzy and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began hitting the old woman on the head with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) force, but at every blow of the axe the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old woman was simply shaking with mirth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was rushing away, but the passage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the landing, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of heads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.
<p/>Something gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) legs were rooted to the spot, they would not move.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tried to scream and woke up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) drew a deep breath--but his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) dream seemed strangely to persist: his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) door was flung open and a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had never seen stood in the doorway watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) intently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it still a dream?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wondered and again raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyelids hardly perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes on Raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hat on the floor beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cane and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) chin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Raskolnikov had hardly opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) instantly closed them again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) back without stirring. It was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was prepared to wait indefinitely.
<p/>As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stolen glances, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost whitish beard.
<p/>Ten minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to get dusk. There was complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.
<p/>Only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It was unbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, tell me what you want. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I knew you were not asleep, but only pretending,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>the stranger answered oddly, laughing calmly.
<p/>'' Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, allow me to introduce myself... '' PART IV CHAPTER I <div class="bookquote">``Can this be still a dream? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Raskolnikov thought once more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor. '' Svidrigaïlov! What nonsense! It can't be! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said at last aloud in bewilderment.
<p/>In the first place, I wanted to make your personal acquaintance, as I have already heard a great deal about you that is interesting and flattering; secondly, I cherish the hope that you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the welfare of your sister, Avdotya Romanovna.
<p/>For without your support she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might not let me come near her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) now, for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is prejudiced against me, but with your assistance I reckon on...''
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation. '' I've come to you for two reasons. <div class="bookquote">``You reckon wrongly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>interrupted Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?'' Raskolnikov made no reply. '' It was yesterday, I know. I only arrived myself the day before.
<p/>Well, let me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I don't consider it necessary to justify myself, but kindly tell me what was there particularly criminal on my part in all this business, speaking without prejudice, with common sense?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov continued to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in silence. '' That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and `insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with my infamous proposals'--is that it?
<p/>But you've only to assume that I, too, am a man et nihil humanum ... in a word, that I am capable of being attracted and falling in love -LRB-which does not depend on our will-RRB-
<p/>-LRB-I am anticipating you.-RRB- , then everything can be explained in the most natural manner. The question is, am I a monster, or am I myself a victim?
<p/>In proposing to the object of my passion to elope with me to America or Switzerland, I may have cherished the deepest respect for her (<font color='blue'><b>monster</b></font>) and may have thought that I was promoting our mutual happiness!
<p/>And what if I am a victim? Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why, probably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!''
<p/>'' But that's not the point,'' Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust. '' It's simply that whether you are right or wrong, we dislike you.
<p/>We don't want to have anything to do with you. We show you the door. Go out!'' Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh.
<p/>'' But you're... but there's no getting round you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) said, laughing in the frankest way. '' I hoped to get round you, but you took up the right line at once!''
<p/>'' But you are trying to get round me still!'' <div class="bookquote">``What of it? What of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>cried Svidrigaïlov, laughing openly. ''
<p/>But still you have interrupted me; one way or another, I repeat again: there would never have been any unpleasantness except for what happened in the garden.
<p/>But this is what the French call bonne guerre , and the most innocent form of deception!... Marfa Petrovna...'' <div class="bookquote">``You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too, so they say?
<p/>But as for your question, I really don't know what to say, though my own conscience is quite at rest on that score.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marfa Petrovna/Petrovna</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov interrupted rudely. '' Oh, you've heard that, too, then? You'd be sure to, though.... Don't suppose that I am in any apprehension about it.
<p/>All was regular and in order; the medical inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy dinner and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved nothing else.
<p/>But I'll tell you what I have been thinking to myself of late, on my way here in the train, especially:
<p/>didn't I contribute to all that... calamity, morally, in a way, by irritation or something of the sort. But I came to the conclusion that that, too, was quite out of the question.
<p/>'' Raskolnikov laughed. '' I wonder you trouble yourself about it!'' '' But what are you laughing at? Only consider, I struck her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) just twice with a switch--there were no marks even...
<p/>; I am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that; but I know for certain, too, that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased at my, so to say, warmth.
<p/>The story of your sister had been wrung out to the last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been forced to sit at home; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had nothing to show herself with in the town.
<p/>don't regard me as a cynic, please Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had bored them so with that letter -LRB-you heard about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) reading the letter-RRB-.
<p/>And all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven! Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) first act was to order the carriage to be got out....
<p/>Not to speak of the fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to be insulted in spite of all their show of indignation.
<p/>There are instances of it with everyone; human beings in general, indeed, greatly love to be insulted, have you noticed that?
<p/>But it's particularly so with women. One might even say it's their only amusement. '' At one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so finishing the interview.
<p/>But some curiosity and even a sort of prudence made him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) linger for a moment. '' You are fond of fighting?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked carelessly. '' No, not very,'' Svidrigaïlov answered, calmly. <div class="bookquote">``And Marfa Petrovna and I scarcely ever fought. We lived very harmoniously, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was always pleased with me.
<p/>I only used the whip twice in all our seven years -LRB-not counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character-RRB-.
<p/>The first time, two months after our marriage, immediately after we arrived in the country, and the last time was that of which we are speaking.
<p/>By the way, do you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years ago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I've forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for having thrashed a German woman in the railway train.
<p/>It was in those days, that very year I believe, the `disgraceful action of the Age ' took place -LRB-you know, '
<p/>Did you suppose I was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver? Ha, ha! You remember? The Egyptian Nights,' that public reading, you remember?
<p/>Well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the German, I feel no sympathy with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), because after all what need is there for sympathy?
<p/>But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking `Germans' that I don't believe there is a progressive who could quite answer for himself.
<p/>No one looked at the subject from that point of view then, but that's the truly humane point of view, I assure you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The dark eyes, you know! Ah, the golden days of our youth, where are they?-RRB-. After saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh again.
<p/>Raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind and able to keep it to himself.
<p/>'' I expect you've not talked to anyone for some days? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked. '' Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my being such an adaptable man?''
<p/>'' No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man. '' '' Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your questions?
<p/>Is that it? But why take offence? As you asked, so I answered,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied, with a surprising expression of simplicity.
<p/>'' You know, there's hardly anything I take interest in ,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, as it were dreamily, <div class="bookquote">``especially now, I've nothing to do....
<p/>You are quite at liberty to imagine though that I am making up to you with a motive, particularly as I told you I want to see your sister about something.
<p/>But I'll confess frankly, I am very much bored. The last three days especially, so I am delighted to see you....
<p/>Say what you like, there's something wrong with you, and now, too... not this very minute, I mean, but now, generally....
<p/>Don't be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, but you seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself. Well, well, I won't, I won't, don't scowl!
<p/>I am not such a bear, you know, as you think. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov looked gloomily at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' You are not a bear, perhaps, at all,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said.
<p/>I fancy indeed that you are a man of very good breeding, or at least know how on occasion to behave like one.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not particularly interested in anyone's opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>Svidrigaïlov answered, dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness, <div class="bookquote">``and therefore why not be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our climate... and especially if one has a natural propensity that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) added, laughing again.
<p/>'' '' But I've heard you have many friends here. You are, as they say, `not without connections.' What can you want with me, then, unless you've some special object?''
<p/>'' That's true that I have friends here,'' Svidrigaïlov admitted, not replying to the chief point. '' I've met some already.
<p/>I've been lounging about for the last three days, and I've seen them, or they've seen me. That's a matter of course.
<p/>I am well dressed and reckoned not a poor man; the emancipation of the serfs hasn't affected me; my property consists chiefly of forests and water meadows.
<p/>The revenue has not fallen off; but... I am not going to see them, I was sick of them long ago.
<p/>I've been here three days and have called on no one.... What a town it is! How has it come into existence among us, tell me that?
<p/>A town of officials and students of all sorts. Yes, there's a great deal I didn't notice when I was here eight years ago, kicking up my heels....
<p/>But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, indeed, maybe--well, all that can go on without me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) went on, again without noticing the question.
<p/>My only hope now is in anatomy, by Jove, it is!'' <div class="bookquote">``Anatomy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' Besides, who wants to be a card-sharper?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, have you been a card-sharper then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How could I help being? There was a regular set of us, men of the best society, eight years ago; we had a fine time.
<p/>And indeed as a rule in our Russian society the best manners are found among those who've been thrashed, have you noticed that?
<p/>And all men of breeding, you know, poets, men of property. I've deteriorated in the country. But I did get into prison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Nezhin.
<p/>Then Marfa Petrovna turned up; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bargained with him (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces -LRB-I owed seventy thousand-RRB-.
<p/>We were united in lawful wedlock and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bore me off into the country like a treasure. You know she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was five years older than
<p/>And, take note, that all my life she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) held a document over me, the IOU for thirty thousand roubles, so if I were to elect to be restive about anything I should be trapped at once!
<p/>I. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was very fond of me. For seven years I never left the country. And she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would have done it!
<p/>Women find nothing incompatible in that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' If it hadn't been for that, would you have given her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) the slip?''
<p/>Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to go abroad, seeing I was bored, but I've been abroad before, and always felt sick there.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to say. It was scarcely the document restrained me. I didn't want to go anywhere else. For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the sea--you look at them and it makes you sad.
<p/>What's most revolting is that one is really sad! No, it's better at home. Here at least one blames others for everything and excuses oneself.
<p/>I should have gone perhaps on an expedition to the North Pole, because j'ai le vin mauvais and hate drinking, and there's nothing left but wine.
<p/>But, I say, I've been told Berg is going up in a great balloon next Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers at a fee.
<p/>I have tried it. Is it true?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, would you go up?''

<p/>'' What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) mean? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) in earnest?'' Raskolnikov wondered. '' No, the document didn't restrain me,'' Svidrigaïlov went on, meditatively.
<p/>It was my own doing, not leaving the country, and nearly a year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day and made me a present of a considerable sum of money, too.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had a fortune, you know. ' You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch'--that was actually her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) expression. You don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) used it?
<p/>But do you know I managed the estate quite decently, they know me in the neighbourhood. I ordered books, too. Marfa Petrovna at first approved, but afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was afraid of my over-studying.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Missing her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)? Perhaps. Really, perhaps I am. And, by the way, do you believe in ghosts?''

(<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>Svidrigaïlov looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) rather oddly. '' Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) said, twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) mouth into a strange smile.
<p/>'' How do you mean `she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is pleased to visit you'?'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has been three times. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) first on the very day of the funeral, an hour after she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was buried.
<p/>The second time was the day before yesterday, at daybreak, on the journey at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two hours ago in the room where I am staying.
<p/>It was the day before I left to come here. I was alone.'' <div class="bookquote">``Were you awake? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite awake. I was wide awake every time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) comes, speaks to me for a minute and goes out at the door--always at the door. I can almost hear her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What made me think that something of the sort must be happening to you? '' Raskolnikov said suddenly. At the same moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was surprised at having said it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was much excited. <div class="bookquote">``What! Did you think so? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>Svidrigaïlov asked in astonishment. '' Did you really? Didn't I say that there was something in common between us, eh?''
<p/>When I came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut, pretending, I said to myself at once, `Here's the man.'''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You never said so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat. '' Didn't I?'' <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I thought I did. '' What do you mean by `the man?'
<p/>What are you talking about?'' cried Raskolnikov. '' What do I mean? I really don't know... '' Svidrigaïlov muttered ingenuously, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), too, were puzzled.
<p/>For a minute they were silent. They stared in each other's faces. '' That's all nonsense!'' Raskolnikov shouted with vexation. ''
<p/>What does she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) say when she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) comes to you?'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)! Would you believe it , she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) talks of the silliest trifles and--
<p/>man is a strange creature--it makes me angry. The first time she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) came in -LRB-I was tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch afterwards.
<p/>At last I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and began to think-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) came in at the door. '
<p/>You've been so busy to-day, Arkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,' she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said. All those seven years I've wound that clock every week, and if I forgot it she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) would always remind me.
<p/>I got out at the station at daybreak; I'd been asleep, tired out, with my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee.
<p/>I looked up and there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of cards in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hands. '
<p/>The next day I set off on my way here. Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady Ivanovitch?' She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was a great hand at telling fortunes.
<p/>I shall never forgive myself for not asking her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) to. I ran away in a fright, and, besides, the bell rang.
<p/>I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a miserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sudden Marfa Petrovna again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) came in very smart in a new green silk dress with a long train. ' Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like my dress?
<p/>-LRB-Aniska was a dressmaker in the country, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a pretty wench.-RRB-
<p/>Aniska can't make like this.' She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress, and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) face. '
<p/>I wonder you trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna.' ' Good gracious, you won't let one disturb you about anything!'
<p/>That's just like you, Arkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a bride when you've hardly buried your wife.
<p/>And if you could make a good choice, at least, but I know it won't be for your happiness or hers, you will only be a laughing-stock to all good people.'
<p/>To tease her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) I said, 'I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.' ' Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went out and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) train seemed to rustle.
<p/>Isn't it nonsense, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But perhaps you are telling lies? '' Raskolnikov put in. '' I rarely lie,'' answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, apparently not noticing the rudeness of the question.
<p/>'' And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?'' '' Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago.
<p/>I had a serf, Filka; just after his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) burial I called out forgetting `Filka, my pipe!' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were.
<p/>I sat still and thought `he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is doing it out of revenge,' because we had a violent quarrel just before his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) death. '
<p/>How dare you come in with a hole in your elbow?' I said. ' Go away, you scamp!' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned and went out, and never came again.
<p/>I didn't tell Marfa Petrovna at the time. I wanted to have a service sung for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), but I was ashamed.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You should go to a doctor.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I don't know what's wrong
<p/>; I believe I am five times as strong as you are. I didn't ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether you believe that they exist.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, I won't believe it!'' Raskolnikov cried, with positive anger. '' What do people generally say? '' muttered Svidrigaïlov, as though speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) head.
<p/>I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but that only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not that they don't exist.
<p/>'' They say, `You are ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy.' But that's not strictly logical. '' ''
<p/>Nothing of the sort,'' Raskolnikov insisted irritably. '' No? You don't think so? '' Svidrigaïlov went on, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) deliberately.
<p/>But what do you say to this argument -LRB-help me with it-RRB-: ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, the beginning of them.
<p/>A man in health has, of course, no reason to see them, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the sake of completeness and order to live only in this life.
<p/>But as soon as one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is broken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the more seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one's contact with that other world, so that as soon as the man dies he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) steps straight into that world.
<p/>'' I thought of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you could believe in that, too.'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe in a future life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>said Raskolnikov.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov sat lost in thought. '' And what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) said suddenly.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) is a madman,'' thought Raskolnikov. '' We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception, something vast, vast! But why must it be vast?
<p/>Instead of all that, what if it's one little room, like a bath house in the country, black and grimy and spiders in every corner, and that's all eternity is?
<p/>I sometimes fancy it like that.'' <div class="bookquote">``Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish.
<p/>And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you know it's what I would certainly have made it,'' answered Svidrigaïlov, with a vague smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Juster? This horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov. Svidrigaïlov raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) head, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), and suddenly began laughing.
<p/>Only think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) cried, ``half an hour ago we had never seen each other, we regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between us; we've thrown it aside, and away we've gone into the abstract!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kindly allow me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov went on irritably, <div class="bookquote">``to ask you to explain why you have honoured me with your visit... and... and I am in a hurry, I have no time to waste.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Wasn't I right in saying that we were birds of a feather?'' I want to go out.'' '' By all means, by all means.
<p/>Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going to be married to Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch?'' <div class="bookquote">``Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) name?
<p/>I can't understand how you dare utter her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) name in my presence, if you really are Svidrigaïlov. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, but I've come here to speak about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); how can I avoid mentioning her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>``I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr. Luzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have only seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) for half an hour, or heard any facts about him (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, speak, but make haste. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) is no match for Avdotya Romanovna. I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing herself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) family.
<p/>I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly advantages.
<p/>Now I know you personally, I am convinced of it. '' '' All this is very naïve... excuse me, I should have said impudent on your part,'' said Raskolnikov.
<p/>Don't be uneasy, Rodion Romanovitch, if I were working for my own advantage, I would not have spoken out so directly.
<p/>I will confess something psychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love for Avdotya Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim.
<p/>Well, let me tell you that I've no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that I wonder myself indeed, for I really did feel something...
<p/>'' You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends. I am not quite a fool. '' <div class="bookquote">``Through idleness and depravity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov put in.
<p/>I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities that even I could not help being impressed by them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it the day before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg.
<p/>I still fancied in Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get Avdotya Romanovna's hand and to cut out Mr. Luzhin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But that's all nonsense, as I see myself now. '' <div class="bookquote">``Have you seen that long?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the object of your visit.
<p/>I am in a hurry, I want to go out...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and determining on a certain... journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminary arrangements.
<p/>I left my children with an aunt; they are well provided for; and they have no need of me personally. And a nice father I should make, too!
<p/>I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year ago. That's enough for me. Excuse me, I am just coming to the point.
<p/>It's not that I detest him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so much, but it was through him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) I quarrelled with Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had dished up this marriage.
<p/>I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if you like in your presence, to explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) that in the first place she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) will never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin.
<p/>Then, begging her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) pardon for all past unpleasantness, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) a present of ten thousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture to which I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is herself not disinclined, if she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could see the way to it.
<p/>Before the journey which may come off, I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are certainly mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as astonished.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, though I am not rich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free; I have absolutely no need for it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>How dare you talk like that!'' If Avdotya Romanovna does not accept it, I shall waste it in some more foolish way.
<p/>That's the first thing. Secondly, my conscience is perfectly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive. You may not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will know.
<p/>The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, whom I greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerely regretting it, I want--not to compensate, not to repay her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) for the unpleasantness, but simply to do something to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) advantage, to show that I am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm.
<p/>If there were a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not have made it so openly; and I should not have offered her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ten thousand only, when five weeks ago I offered her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) more,
<p/>Besides, I may, perhaps, very soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicion of any design on Avdotya Romanovna.
<p/>In conclusion, let me say that in marrying Mr. Luzhin, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is taking money just the same, only from another man.
<p/>Don't be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it over coolly and quietly. '' Svidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was saying this.
<p/>'' I beg you to say no more,'' said Raskolnikov. '' In any case this is unpardonable impertinence. '' <div class="bookquote">``Not in the least.
<p/>Then a man may do nothing but harm to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour in this world, and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good by trivial conventional formalities.
<p/>That's absurd. If I died, for instance, and left that sum to your sister in my will, surely she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wouldn't refuse it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though ten thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion.
<p/>In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to try and see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) myself and worry her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) by doing so.''
<p/>In any case I beg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya Romanovna.'' '' No, I won't.'' '' ''
<p/>And if I do tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), will you not try to see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?'' '' I don't know really what to say.
<p/>I should like very much to see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) once more.'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't hope for it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I'm sorry. But you don't know me.
<p/>Perhaps we may become better friends.'' <div class="bookquote">``You think we may become friends?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And why not? '' Svidrigaïlov said, smiling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) stood up and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) hat.
<p/>'' I didn't quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning on it... though I was very much struck by your face this morning.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Where did you see me this morning? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov asked uneasily. '' I saw you by chance.... I kept fancying there is something about you like me....
<p/>I am not intrusive; I used to get on all right with card-sharpers, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great personage who is a distant relation of mine, and I could write about Raphael's Madonna in Madam Prilukov's album, and I never left Marfa Petrovna's side for seven years, and I used to stay the night at Viazemsky's house in the Hay Market in the old days, and I may go up in a balloon with Berg, perhaps.''
<p/>But don't be uneasy. '' Oh, all right. Are you starting soon on your travels, may I ask?'' <div class="bookquote">``What travels? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, on that `journey'; you spoke of it yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A journey? Oh, yes. I did speak of a journey. Well, that's a wide subject....
<p/>if only you knew what you are asking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Berg</b></font>) added, and gave a sudden, loud, short laugh. '' Perhaps I'll get married instead of the journey.
<p/>They're making a match for me.'' <div class="bookquote">``Here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How have you had time for that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once.
<p/>I earnestly beg it. Well, good-bye for the present. Oh, yes. I have forgotten something. Tell your sister, Rodion Romanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will and left her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) three thousand roubles.
<p/>That's absolutely certain. Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) death, and it was done in my presence. Avdotya Romanovna will be able to receive the money in two or three weeks.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you telling the truth?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Well, your servant. I am staying very near you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went out, Svidrigaïlov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway.
<p/>CHAPTER II It was nearly eight o'clock. The two young men hurried to Bakaleyev's, to arrive before Luzhin. '' Why, who was that?
<p/>'' asked Razumihin, as soon as they were in the street. '' It was Svidrigaïlov, that landowner in whose house my sister was insulted when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was their governess.
<p/>Through his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) persecuting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) attentions, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was turned out by his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) wife, Marfa Petrovna. This Marfa Petrovna begged Dounia's forgiveness afterwards, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s just died suddenly.
<p/>It was of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) we were talking this morning. I don't know why I'm afraid of that man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came here at once after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's funeral.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very strange, and is determined on doing something.... We must guard Dounia from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)... that's what I wanted to tell you, do you hear?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guard her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)! What can he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do to harm Avdotya Romanovna? Thank you, Rodya, for speaking to me like that.... We will, we will guard her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>Where does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) live?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you ask? What a pity! I'll find out, though.''

(<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>asked Raskolnikov after a pause.
<p/>'' Yes, I noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), I noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) well. '' <div class="bookquote">``You did really see him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)? You saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) clearly? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov insisted.
<p/>'' Yes, I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) perfectly, I should know him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in a thousand; I have a good memory for faces. ''
<p/>They were silent again. '' Hm! ... that's all right,'' muttered Raskolnikov. '' Do you know, I fancied... I keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination.''
<p/>'' What do you mean? I don't understand you.'' '' Well, you all say,'' Raskolnikov went on, twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mouth into a smile, <div class="bookquote">``that I am mad.
<p/>I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad, and have only seen a phantom. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>'' What do you mean?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, who can tell? Perhaps I am really mad, and perhaps everything that happened all these days may be only imagination.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again!... But what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) say, what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) come for? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov did not answer.
<p/>Razumihin thought a minute. '' Now let me tell you my story,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``I came to you, you were asleep.
<p/>Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry's , Zametov was still with him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>). I tried to begin, but it was no use.
<p/>I couldn't speak in the right way. They don't seem to understand and can't understand, but are not a bit ashamed.
<p/>I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>), but it was still no use. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) looked away and I looked away.
<p/>At last I shook my fist in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) ugly face, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) as a cousin I'd brain him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) merely looked at me, I cursed and came away.
<p/>But, you see, I thought I'd made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me: why should we trouble?
<p/>That was all. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didn't say a word. Of course if you were in any danger or anything, but why need you care?
<p/>We shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I'd mystify them more than ever.
<p/>You needn't care a hang for them. How ashamed they'll be afterwards! Hang them! We can thrash them afterwards, but let's laugh at them now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Strange to say, till that moment it had never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) to wonder what Razumihin would think when he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) knew.
<p/>'' To be sure,'' answered Raskolnikov. '' But what will you say to-morrow? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought to himself. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought it, Raskolnikov looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Razumihin's account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) visit to Porfiry had very little interest for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), so much had come and gone since then.
<p/>In the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had arrived punctually at eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in together without greeting or looking at one another.
<p/>The young men walked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a little in the passage, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) coat.
<p/>Pulcheria Alexandrovna came forward at once to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) brother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with redoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies.
<p/>Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) looked, however, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) were a little put out and could not yet recover himself. Dounia and Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table.
<p/>Razumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna , Razumihin was next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sister. A moment's silence followed.
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) nose with an air of a benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to insist on an explanation.
<p/>In the passage the idea had occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to keep on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.
<p/>Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not endure uncertainty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wanted an explanation: if his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) request had been so openly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was better to find it out beforehand
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not bring himself to do this. ; it rested with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to punish them and there would always be time for that.
<p/>'' I trust you had a favourable journey,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) inquired officially of Pulcheria Alexandrovna. '' Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch. '' <div class="bookquote">``I am gratified to hear it.
<p/>And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued either?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am young and strong, I don't get tired, but it was a great strain for mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>answered Dounia.
<p/>'' That's unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible length. ' Mother Russia,' as they say, is a vast country.... In spite of all my desire to do so, I was unable to meet you yesterday.
<p/>Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheartening,'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation, <div class="bookquote">``and if Dmitri Prokofitch had not been sent us, I really believe by God Himself, we should have been utterly lost.
<p/>But I trust all passed off without inconvenience?''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>'' Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is! Dmitri Prokofitch Razumihin,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) added, introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to Luzhin.
<p/>I had the pleasure... yesterday,'' muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) scowled and was silent.
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very polite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who, directly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.
<p/>'' Again all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya Romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon. Razumihin had nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again.
<p/>'' Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) began having recourse to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) leading item of conversation. '' To be sure, I heard so.
<p/>I was immediately informed, and I have come to make you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov set off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) wife's funeral.
<p/>So at least I have excellent authority for believing. '' <div class="bookquote">``To Petersburg? here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother.
<p/>Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the rapidity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) departure, and all the circumstances preceding it.''
<p/>I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for uneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting into communication with him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>).
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens! won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) leave Dounia in peace even here? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. '' For my part I am on my guard, and am now discovering where he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) is lodging.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have given me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: <div class="bookquote">``I've only seen him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) twice, but I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) terrible, terrible!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>I am convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was the cause of Marfa Petrovna's death.'' '' It's impossible to be certain about that.
<p/>I do not dispute that he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) may have contributed to accelerate the course of events by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I am in agreement with you.
<p/>I do not know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) is well off now, and precisely what Marfa Petrovna left him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>); this will be known to me within a very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) has any pecuniary resources, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) will relapse at once into his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) old ways.
<p/>I have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so unfortunate as to fall in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) and to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) debts eight years ago, was of service to him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) also in another way.
<p/>Solely by her (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) exertions and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic and homicidal brutality for which he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) might well have been sentenced to Siberia, was hushed up.
<p/>I have precise information. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) is the most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men. That's the sort of man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, if you care to know.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskolnikov listened attentively. '' Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of this?''
<p/>Dounia asked sternly and emphatically. '' I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. I must observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.
<p/>There was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich, a foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other commissions, and with this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close and mysterious relations.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a relation, a niece I believe, living with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than fourteen.
<p/>Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) every crust; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) used to beat her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mercilessly. One day the girl was found hanging in the garret.
<p/>After the usual proceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that the child had been... cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov.
<p/>It is true, this was not clearly established, the information was given by another German woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement was actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna's money and exertions; it did not get beyond gossip.
<p/>You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were with them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) received six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom.
<p/>At the inquest the verdict was suicide. And yet the story is a very significant one. '' <div class="bookquote">``I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Quite so, but what drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), or rather perhaps disposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr. Svidrigaïlov.
<p/>I only heard a queer story that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher, the servants used to say, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) read himself silly,' and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hanged himself partly on account of Mr. Svidrigaïlov's mockery of him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) and not his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) blows.
<p/>When I was there he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) behaved well to the servants, and they were actually fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), though they certainly did blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) for Philip's death.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) defence all of a sudden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>Luzhin observed, twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lips into an ambiguous smile, <div class="bookquote">``there's no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is an astute man, and insinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has died so strangely, is a terrible instance.
<p/>My only desire has been to be of service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>'' '' I don't know that,'' answered Dounia, dryly. '' '' For my part it's my firm conviction, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will end in a debtor's prison again.
<p/>Marfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything substantial on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), having regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) children's interests, and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency, something insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) habits.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>said Dounia, <div class="bookquote">``say no more of Mr. Svidrigaïlov. It makes me miserable. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) has just been to see me,'' said Raskolnikov, breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) silence for the first time.
<p/>There were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). Even Pyotr Petrovitch was roused. '' An hour and a half ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) came in when I was asleep, waked me, and introduced himself,'' Raskolnikov continued.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was fairly cheerful and at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is particularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked me to assist.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) told me, too, that a week before her (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) death Marfa Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) will, Dounia, and that you can receive the money very shortly.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) has a proposition to make to you, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) told me about it. <div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself.
<p/>'' Pray for her (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) soul, Dounia!'' '' It's a fact!'' broke from Luzhin. <div class="bookquote">``Tell us, what more?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>Dounia urged Raskolnikov. ''
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wasn't rich and all the estate was left to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) children who are now with an aunt, then that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was staying somewhere not far from me, but where, I don't know, I didn't ask...
<p/>'' '' But what, what does he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) want to propose to Dounia?'' cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna in a fright. '' Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tell you?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What was it?'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you afterwards.

Pyotr Petrovitch looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) watch.
<p/>I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I shall not be in your way,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added with an air of some pique and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began getting up.
<p/>'' '' Don't go, Pyotr Petrovitch,'' said Dounia, <div class="bookquote">``you intended to spend the evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an explanation with mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>Pyotr Petrovitch answered impressively, sitting down again, but still holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hat. '' I certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon a very important point indeed.
<p/>But as your brother cannot speak openly in my presence of some proposals of Mr. Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do not desire and am not able to speak openly... in the presence of others... of certain matters of the greatest gravity.
<p/>Moreover, my most weighty and urgent request has been disregarded... '' Assuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence. ''
<p/>Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was disregarded solely at my insistance,'' said Dounia. ''
<p/>You wrote that you had been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained at once, and you must be reconciled.
<p/>And if Rodya really has insulted you, then he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should and will apologise. '' Pyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line. ''
<p/>There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep; and when it has been overstepped, there is no return.''
<p/>There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no goodwill can make us forget. '' That wasn't what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petrovitch,'' Dounia interrupted with some impatience.
<p/>Please understand that our whole future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as soon as possible.
<p/>I tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at it in any other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this business must be ended to-day, however hard that may be.
<p/>'' I repeat that if my brother is to blame he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will ask your forgiveness.'' <div class="bookquote">``I am surprised at your putting the question like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>said Luzhin, getting more and more irritated.
<p/>Esteeming, and so to say, adoring you, I may at the same time, very well indeed, be able to dislike some member of your family.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, don't be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>Dounia interrupted with feeling, <div class="bookquote">``and be the sensible and generous man I have always considered, and wish to consider, you to be.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I cannot accept duties incompatible with... I've given you a great promise, I am your betrothed.
<p/>Trust me in this matter and, believe me, I shall be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part of judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you.
<p/>When I insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) coming to our interview to-day after your letter, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) nothing of what I meant to do.
<p/>Understand that, if you are not reconciled, I must choose between you--it must be either you or he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). That is how the question rests on your side and on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/>I don't want to be mistaken in my choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off with my brother, for my brother's sake
<p/>I can find out for certain now whether he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is a brother to me, and I want to know it; and of you, whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem me, whether you are the husband for me.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Avdotya Romanovna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>Luzhin declared huffily, <div class="bookquote">``your words are of too much consequence to me; I will say more, they are offensive in view of the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you.
<p/>To say nothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an impertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to me.
<p/>I must break off with you. You say `you or he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),' showing thereby of how little consequence I am in your eyes...
<p/>I set your interest beside all that has hitherto been most precious in my life, what has made up the whole of my life, and here you are offended at my making too little account of you.
<p/>Raskolnikov smiled sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, but Pyotr Petrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the contrary, at every word he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) became more persistent and irritable, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) relished it.

<p/>Your son intentionally exaggerated the significance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing me of malicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied upon your correspondence with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>I shall consider myself happy, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite conclusion, and thereby considerately reassure me.

<p/>Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but you yourself have just written what was false about him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna added, gaining courage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wrote,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov said sharply, not turning to Luzhin, <div class="bookquote">``that I gave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed, as was the fact, but to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter -LRB-whom I had never seen till yesterday-RRB-.

<p/>'' I am ashamed, Rodya,'' said Dounia. '' Pyotr Petrovitch, go away,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), white with anger. Pyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had too much confidence in himself, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) power and in the helplessness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) victims. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not believe it even now.
<p/>Avdotya Romanovna, if I go out of this door now, after such a dismissal, then, you may reckon on it, I will never come back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned pale, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lips quivered. '' Consider what you are doing. My word is not to be shaken. ''

<p/>'' What right have you to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) like that?'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna intervened hotly. '' And what can you protest about?

<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) for some seconds with a pale face that worked with anger, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned, went out, and rarely has any man carried away in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart such vindictive hatred as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt against Raskolnikov.
<p/>It is noteworthy that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went downstairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) still imagined that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) case was perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were concerned, all might <div class="bookquote">``very well indeed''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>be set right again.

<p/>The fact was that up to the last moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had never expected such an ending; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming that two destitute and defenceless women could escape from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) control.
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) way up from insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, had the highest opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloated in solitude over his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) image in the glass.
<p/>But what he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) loved and valued above all was the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had amassed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) labour, and by all sorts of devices: that money made him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) the equal of all who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) superiors.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had bitterly reminded Dounia that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had decided to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in spite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity and had, indeed, felt genuinely indignant at such <div class="bookquote">``black ingratitude.
<p/>This conviction was strengthened by his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) vanity and conceit, a conceit to the point of fatuity. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>And yet, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) made Dounia his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) offer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was fully aware of the groundlessness of all the gossip.
<p/>The story had been everywhere contradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by all the townspeople, who were warm in Dounia'a defence.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) still thought highly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own resolution in lifting Dounia to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) level and regarded it as something heroic.
<p/>In speaking of it to Dounia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had let out the secret feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cherished and admired, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not understand that others should fail to admire it too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had called on Raskolnikov with the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) good deeds and to hear agreeable flattery.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would not have denied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knew all that at the time. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went downstairs now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.
<p/>Dounia was simply essential to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); to do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was unthinkable. For many years he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had gone on waiting and amassing money.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) brooded with relish, in profound secret, over the image of a girl--virtuous, poor -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must be poor-RRB-, very young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, one who had suffered much, and was completely humbled before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), one who would all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life look on him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saviour, worship him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and only him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>How many scenes, how many amorous episodes he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had imagined on this seductive and playful theme, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) work was over!
<p/>And, behold, the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty and education of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) helpless position had been a great allurement; in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had found even more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) dreamed of.
<p/>Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of education and breeding superior to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt that-RRB-, and this creature would be slavishly grateful all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life for his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heroic condescension, and would humble herself in the dust before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would have absolute, unbounded power over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)!...
<p/>Not long before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had, too, after long reflection and hesitation, made an important change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) career and was now entering on a wider circle of business.
<p/>With this change his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely to be realised.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was, in fact, determined to try his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fortune in Petersburg.
<p/>The fascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), throwing an aureole round him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), and now everything was in ruins!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knew that women could do a very great deal. This sudden horrible rupture affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) like a clap of thunder; it was like a hideous joke, an absurdity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had only been a tiny bit masterful, had not even time to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried away--and it had ended so seriously.
<p/>And, of course, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did love Dounia in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own way; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) already possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) dreams--and all at once!
<p/>No! The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right, smoothed over, settled. Above all he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) must crush that conceited milksop who was the cause of it all.
<p/>With a sick feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not help recalling Razumihin too, but, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) soon reassured himself on that score; as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!
<p/>The man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov.... He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, in short, a great deal to attend to... * **** ''
<p/>I was tempted by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money, but on my honour, brother, I had no idea he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was such a base man.
<p/>No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!'' said Dounia, kissing and embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother. '' If I had seen through him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before, nothing would have tempted me!
<p/>Don't blame me, brother!'' <div class="bookquote">``God has delivered us! God has delivered us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>Pulcheria Alexandrovna muttered, but half consciously, as though scarcely able to realise what had happened.
<p/>They were all relieved, and in five minutes they were laughing. Only now and then Dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed.
<p/>Pulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too, was glad: she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible misfortune.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not yet dare to express his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) joy fully, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight had fallen off his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Razumihin was delighted. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had the right to devote his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) life to them, to serve them.... Anything might happen now!
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt afraid to think of further possibilities and dared not let his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) imagination range. But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and indifferent.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been the most insistent on getting rid of Luzhin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) seemed now the least concerned at what had happened.
<p/>Dounia could not help thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was still angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), and Pulcheria Alexandrovna watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) timidly. '' What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?'' said Dounia, approaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) desires to see you once in my presence.''
<p/>'' Yes, yes!'' cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskolnikov raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head. '' <div class="bookquote">``See her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)! On no account!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. '' And how dare he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) offer her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) money!''
<p/>Then Raskolnikov repeated -LRB-rather dryly-RRB- his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) conversation with Svidrigaïlov, omitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) account of the ghostly visitations of Marfa Petrovna, wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk.
<p/>'' What answer did you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)?'' asked Dounia. '' At first I said I would not take any message to you.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would do his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) assured me that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) passion for you was a passing infatuation, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) has no feeling for you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) doesn't want you to marry Luzhin.... His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) talk was altogether rather muddled. '' <div class="bookquote">``How do you explain him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to yourself, Rodya?
<p/>How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) strike you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must confess I don't quite understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) offers you ten thousand, and yet says he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is not well off.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is going away, and in ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) forgets he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) has said it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is going to be married and has already fixed on the girl....
<p/>No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) has a motive, and probably a bad one. But it's odd that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) should be so clumsy about it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had any designs against you....
<p/>Of course, I refused this money on your account, once for all. Altogether, I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) very strange.... One might almost think he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was mad.
<p/>But I may be mistaken; that may only be the part he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) assumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems to have made a great impression on him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God rest her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. '' I shall always, always pray for her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)! Where should we be now, Dounia, without this three thousand!
<p/>It's as though it had fallen from heaven! Why, Rodya, this morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia
<p/>and I were just planning to pawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that man until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offered help.
<p/>'' Dounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov's offer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) still stood meditating. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) has got some terrible plan,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said in a half whisper to herself, almost shuddering.
<p/>Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror. '' I fancy I shall have to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) more than once again,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said to Dounia.
<p/>'' We will watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)! I will track him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) out! '' cried Razumihin, vigorously. '' I won't lose sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>).
<p/>Rodya has given me leave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) said to me himself just now. ' Take care of my sister.' Will you give me leave, too, Avdotya Romanovna?''
<p/>Dounia smiled and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hand, but the look of anxiety did not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) timidly, but the three thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).
<p/>A quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a lively conversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for some time, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not talk.
<p/>Razumihin was the speaker. '' And why, why should you go away? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) flowed on ecstatically. '' And what are you to do in a little town?
<p/>The great thing is, you are all here together and you need one another --you do need one another, believe me.
<p/>For a time, anyway.... Take me into partnership, and I assure you we'll plan a capital enterprise. Listen! I'll explain it all in detail to you, the whole project!
<p/>I tell you what; I have an uncle, I must introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to you -LRB-a most accommodating and respectable old man-RRB-.
<p/>This uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) lives on his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pension and has no need of that money.
<p/>For the last two years he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has been bothering me to borrow it from him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) and pay him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) six per cent.
<p/>It all flashed into my head this morning, before anything had happened... interest. I know what that means; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) simply wants to help me.
<p/>Last year I had no need of it, but this year I resolved to borrow it as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) arrived.
<p/>Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have enough for a start, so we'll go into partnership, and what are we going to do?
<p/>Then Razumihin began to unfold his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) project, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) explained at length that almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all of what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad publishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give a profit, sometimes a considerable one.
<p/>For the last two years he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had been working in publishers' offices, and knew three European languages well, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had told Raskolnikov six days before that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``schwach''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in German with an object of persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) to take half his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) translation and half the payment for it.
<p/>'' Razumihin had, indeed, been dreaming of setting up as a publisher. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had told a lie then, and Raskolnikov knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was lying.
<p/>Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief means of success--money of our own!
<p/>'' '' cried Razumihin warmly. '' Of course there will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna, I, Rodion....
<p/>And the great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all at once.
<p/>You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! I can be of use because I have experience. For nearly two years I've been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every detail of their business.
<p/>Why, I know--and I kept the secret--two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles simply for thinking of translating and publishing.
<p/>You need not be a saint to make pots, believe me! And why, why should we let our chance slip! Indeed, and I would not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them.
<p/>And what do you think? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>)'d hesitate--they are such blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling, you trust to me, I know my way about.
<p/>We'll begin in a small way and go on to a large. In any case it will get us our living and we shall get back our capital.
<p/>I know nothing about it, of course,'' put in Pulcheria Alexandrovna, <div class="bookquote">``it may be a good idea, but again God knows.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria</b></font>)</div>Dounia's eyes shone. '' I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) said. '' It's new and untried.
<p/>Of course, we must remain here at least for a time. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) looked at Rodya. '' What do you think, brother?'' said Dounia.
<p/>Of course, it's too soon to dream of a publishing firm, but we certainly might bring out five or six books and be sure of success.
<p/>'' I think he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s got a very good idea,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) answered. '' I know of one book myself which would be sure to go well.
<p/>And as for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) being able to manage it, there's no doubt about that either. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knows the business.... But we can talk it over later...
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Hurrah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Razumihin. '' Now, stay, there's a flat here in this house, belonging to the same owner. It's a special flat apart, not communicating with these lodgings.
<p/>It's furnished, rent moderate, three rooms. Suppose you take them to begin with. I'll pawn your watch to-morrow and bring you the money, and everything can be arranged then.
<p/>You can all three live together, and Rodya will be with you. But where are you off to, Rodya?'' <div class="bookquote">``What, Rodya, you are going already?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div><p/>Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in dismay. '' At such a minute?'' cried Razumihin. Dounia looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) brother with incredulous wonder. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cap in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was preparing to leave them.
<p/>'' One would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said somewhat oddly. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) attempted to smile, but it did not turn out a smile.
<p/>'' But who knows, perhaps it is the last time we shall see each other... '' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) let slip accidentally. It was what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was thinking, and it somehow was uttered aloud.
<p/>'' What is the matter with you?'' cried his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mother. '' Where are you going, Rodya? '' asked Dounia rather strangely.
<p/>'' Oh, I'm quite obliged to... '' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) answered vaguely, as though hesitating what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would say. But there was a look of sharp determination in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) white face.
<p/>I meant to tell you, mother, and you, Dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time.
<p/>'' I meant to say... as I was coming here... I feel ill, I am not at peace.... I will come afterwards, I will come of myself... when it's possible.
<p/>I remember you and love you.... Leave me, leave me alone. I decided this even before... I'm absolutely resolved on it.
<p/>Whatever may come to me, whether I come to ruin or not, I want to be alone. Forget me altogether, it's better.
<p/>Perhaps it will all come back, but now if you love me, give me up... else I shall begin to hate you, I feel it....
<p/>Don't inquire about me. When I can, I'll come of myself or... I'll send for you. Good-bye!'' <div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
<p/>Both his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sister were terribly alarmed. Razumihin was also. '' Rodya, Rodya, be reconciled with us! Let us be as before!'' cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) poor mother.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room. Dounia overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>). '' Brother, what are you doing to mother?
<p/>I'm coming,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) muttered in an undertone, as though not fully conscious of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) was saying, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) went out of the room.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whispered, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes flashing with indignation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) looked dully at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). '' No matter, I shall come... '' Wicked, heartless egoist!'' cried Dounia.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) is insane, but not heartless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) is mad! Don't you see it? You're heartless after that! '' Razumihin whispered in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ear, squeezing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand tightly.
<p/>'' I shall be back directly,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) shouted to the horror-stricken mother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) ran out of the room. Raskolnikov was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) at the end of the passage.
<p/>'' I knew you would run after me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Go back to them--be with them... be with them to-morrow and always
<p/>.... I... perhaps I shall come... if I can. Good-bye. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And without holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walked away. ''
<p/>But where are you going? What are you doing? What's the matter with you? How can you go on like this?
<p/>'' Razumihin muttered, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) wits' end. Raskolnikov stopped once more. '' Once for all, never ask me about anything. I have nothing to tell you.
<p/>Don't come to see me. Maybe I'll come here.... Leave me, but don't leave them. Do you understand me? '' It was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp.
<p/>For a minute they were looking at one another in silence. Razumihin remembered that minute all his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) life. Raskolnikov's burning and intent eyes grew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) soul, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) consciousness.
<p/>Suddenly Razumihin started. Something strange, as it were, passed between them.... Some idea, some hint, as it were, slipped, something awful, hideous, and suddenly understood on both sides....
<p/>Razumihin turned pale. '' Do you understand now?'' said Raskolnikov, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face twitching nervously. '' Go back, go to them,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said suddenly, and turning quickly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went out of the house.
<p/>I will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back to the ladies, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) soothed them, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) protested that Rodya needed rest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) illness, protested that Rodya was sure to come, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) would come every day, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was very, very much upset, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) must not be irritated, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), Razumihin, would watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), would get him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) a doctor, the best doctor, a consultation....
<p/>In fact from that evening Razumihin took his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) place with them as a son and a brother. CHAPTER IV Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia lived.
<p/>It was an old green house of three storeys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) found the porter and obtained from him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) vague directions as to the whereabouts of Kapernaumov, the tailor.
<p/>Having found in the corner of the courtyard the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) mounted to the second floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey over the yard.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where to turn for Kapernaumov's door, a door opened three paces from him (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) mechanically took hold of it.
<p/>'' Who is there?'' a woman's voice asked uneasily. '' It's I... come to see you,'' answered Raskolnikov and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walked into the tiny entry.
<p/>On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick. '' It's you! Good heavens! '' cried Sonia weakly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) stood rooted to the spot.
<p/>A minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) inexpressibly agitated and apparently frightened by his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) unexpected visit.
<p/>'' Which is your room? This way? '' and Raskolnikov, trying not to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), hastened in. The colour rushed suddenly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) pale face and tears came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes...
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) felt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... Raskolnikov turned away quickly and sat on a chair by the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) scanned the room in a rapid glance.
<p/>It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.
<p/>In the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always kept locked. That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.
<p/>A wall with three windows looking out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.
<p/>Sonia's room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and this gave it a grotesque appearance. The other corner was disproportionately obtuse.
<p/>There was scarcely any furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead, beside it, nearest the door, a chair.
<p/>A plain, deal table covered by a blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other flat.
<p/>On the opposite wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers looking, as it were, lost in a desert.
<p/>Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. That was all there was in the room. The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the corners.
<p/>It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. There was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.
<p/>Sonia looked in silence at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) visitor, who was so attentively and unceremoniously scrutinising her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) room, and even began at last to tremble with terror, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was standing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) judge and the arbiter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) destinies.
<p/>'' I am late.... It's eleven, isn't it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) asked, still not lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) eyes. '' Yes,'' muttered Sonia, <div class="bookquote">``oh yes, it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) added, hastily, as though in that lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) means of escape.
<p/>'' My landlady's clock has just struck... I heard it myself...'' <div class="bookquote">``I've come to you for the last time,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov went on gloomily, although this was the first time.
<p/>'' I may perhaps not see you again... '' <div class="bookquote">``Are you... going away?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know... to-morrow...''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>Sonia's voice shook. '' I don't know. I shall know to-morrow morning.... Never mind that: I've come to say one word....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) brooding eyes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and suddenly noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was sitting down while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was all the while standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>'' '' Why are you standing? Sit down,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said in a changed voice, gentle and friendly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) sat down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked kindly and almost compassionately at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>'' How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like a dead hand. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hand. Sonia smiled faintly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, you were,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added abruptly and the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face and the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) voice changed again suddenly.
<p/>'' I have always been like that,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) said. '' Even when you lived at home?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) once more.
<p/>'' You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They live there, through that door?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes.... They have another room like this.''
<p/>They are very good people, very kind,'' answered Sonia, who still seemed bewildered, <div class="bookquote">``and all the furniture, everything... everything is theirs.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>All in one room? '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should be afraid in your room at night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) observed gloomily. '' And they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me.''
<p/>'' They all stammer, don't they?'' '' Yes.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stammers and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'s lame. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wife, too.... It's not exactly that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stammers, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) can't speak plainly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is a very kind woman. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) used to be a house serf. And there are seven children... and it's only the eldest one that stammers and the others are simply ill...
<p/>but they don't stammer.... But where did you hear about them? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) added with some surprise. '' Your father told me, then.
<p/>And how you went out at six o'clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna knelt down by your bed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me all about you... '' Sonia was confused. '' I fancied I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to-day,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) whispered hesitatingly. ''
<p/>Whom?'' <div class="bookquote">``Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten o'clock and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) seemed to be walking in front.
<p/>It looked just like him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). I wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You were walking in the streets?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and looking down.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh no, what are you saying? No!'' Sonia looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) almost with dismay.
<p/>'' You love her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), then?'' <div class="bookquote">``Love her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)? Of course!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands in distress.
<p/>'' Ah, you don't.... If you only knew! You see, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is quite like a child.... Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mind is quite unhinged, you see... from sorrow.
<p/>And how clever she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) used to be... how generous... how kind! Ah, you don't understand, you don't understand!'' Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands in excitement and distress.
<p/>It was clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was stirred to the very depths, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was longing to speak, to champion, to express something.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes. A sort of insatiable compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in every feature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) did beat me, what then? What of it? You know nothing, nothing about it....
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is so unhappy... ah, how unhappy! And ill.... She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is seeking righteousness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is pure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has such faith that there must be righteousness everywhere
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) expects it.... And if you were to torture her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) wouldn't do wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) doesn't see that it's impossible for people to be righteous
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is angry at it. Like a child, like a child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is good!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And what will happen to you?''
<p/>Sonia looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) inquiringly. '' They are left on your hands, you see. They were all on your hands before, though....
<p/>And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well, how will it be now?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>Sonia articulated mournfully.
<p/>They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady, I hear, said to-day that she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) wanted to get rid of them, and
<p/>'' Will they stay there?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know.... Katerina Ivanovna says that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) won't stay another minute. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How is it
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is so bold? She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) relies upon you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, no, don't talk like that.... We are one, we live like one.
<p/>'' Sonia was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other little bird were to be angry.
<p/>'' And what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) do? What, what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) do? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) persisted, getting hot and excited. '' And how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cried to-day!
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mind is unhinged, haven't you noticed it? At one minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the lunch and all that....
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands, spitting blood, weeping, and all at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) will begin knocking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) head against the wall, in despair.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) builds all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hopes on you; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) says that you will help her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) now and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) will borrow a little money somewhere and go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) native town with me and set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to superintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) will be comforted again. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) kisses and hugs me, comforts me, and you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has such faith, such faith in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) fancies!
<p/>One can't contradict her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). And all the day long she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has been washing, cleaning, mending. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) dragged the wash tub into the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath.
<p/>We went this morning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are quite worn out. Only the money we'd reckoned wasn't enough, not nearly enough.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) picked out such dear little boots, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has taste, you don't know. And there in the shop she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) burst out crying before the shopmen because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hadn't enough....
<p/>Ah, it was sad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)...'' '' Well, after that I can understand your living like this,'' Raskolnikov said with a bitter smile.
<p/>'' And aren't you sorry for them? Aren't you sorry?'' Sonia flew at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) again. '' Why, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you'd seen nothing of it, and if you'd seen everything,
<p/>oh dear! And how often, how often I've brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only a week before his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) death.
<p/>I was cruel! And how often I've done it! Ah, I've been wretched at the thought of it all day!'' Sonia wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) spoke at the pain of remembering it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I--I. I went to see them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) went on, weeping, <div class="bookquote">``and father said, `read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here's a book.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a book he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) lives there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) always used to get hold of such funny books.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>You were cruel?'' And I said, 'I can't stay,' as I didn't want to read, and I'd gone in chiefly to show Katerina Ivanovna some collars.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna liked them very much; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) put them on and looked at herself in the glass and was delighted with them. '
<p/>Make me a present of them, Sonia,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) said, `please do.' ' Please do ,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) wanted them so much.
<p/>Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. And when could she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) wear them? They just reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) old happy days.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has no clothes at all, no things of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) own, hasn't had all these years!
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) never asks anyone for anything; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is proud, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)'d sooner give away everything. And these she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) asked for, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) liked them so much.
<p/>And I was sorry to give them. ' What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?' I said. I spoke like that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)
<p/>, I ought not to have said that! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) gave me such a look. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>And it was so sad to see.... And she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was not grieved for the collars, but for my refusing, I saw that.
<p/>Ah, if only I could bring it all back, change it, take back those words! Ah, if I... but it's nothing to you!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes.... Did you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)?'' Sonia asked with some surprise. '' Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) will soon die,'' said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) question.
<p/>'' Oh, no, no, no!'' And Sonia unconsciously clutched both his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands, as though imploring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) should not. '' But it will be better if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) does die.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not better, not at all better!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>Sonia unconsciously repeated in dismay. '' And the children? What can you do except take them to live with you?''
<p/>'' Oh, I don't know,'' cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) head. It was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) before and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had only roused it again.
<p/>And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get ill and are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?
<p/>'' '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) persisted pitilessly. '' How can you? That cannot be!'' And Sonia's face worked with awful terror. '' Cannot be?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. '' You are not insured against it, are you? What will happen to them then?
<p/>They will be in the street, all of them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) will cough and beg and knock her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) head against some wall, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) did to-day, and the children will cry....
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the hospital, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) will die, and the children...''
<p/>'' Oh, no.... God will not let it be!'' broke at last from Sonia's overburdened bosom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) listened, looking imploringly at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands in dumb entreaty, as though it all depended upon him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A minute passed. Sonia was standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) head hanging in terrible dejection.
<p/>'' And can't you save? Put by for a rainy day? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked, stopping suddenly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). '' No,'' whispered Sonia.
<p/>'' Of course not. Have you tried? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added almost ironically. '' Yes.'' '' And it didn't come off! Of course not!
<p/>No need to ask. '' And again he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) paced the room. Another minute passed. '' You don't get money every day?
<p/>'' Sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face again. '' No,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) whispered with a painful effort.
<p/>'' It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said suddenly. '' No, no! It can't be, no!'' Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had been stabbed.
<p/>'' God would not allow anything so awful!'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lets others come to it.'' <div class="bookquote">``No, no! God will protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), God!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) repeated beside herself. '' But, perhaps, there is no God at all,'' Raskolnikov answered with a sort of malignance, laughed and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not speak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Sonia's face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. '' You say Katerina Ivanovna's mind is unhinged; your own mind is unhinged,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said after a brief silence.
<p/>Five minutes passed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) still paced up and down the room in silence, not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes glittered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) two hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) shoulders and looked straight into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) tearful face. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lips were twitching.
<p/>All at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) bent down quickly and dropping to the ground, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) foot. Sonia drew back from him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) as from a madman.
<p/>And certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked like a madman. '' What are you doing to me? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) muttered, turning pale, and a sudden anguish clutched at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) heart.
<p/>I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said wildly and walked away to the window.
<p/>I said just now to an insolent man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not worth your little finger... and that I did my sister honour making her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sit beside you.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood up at once. '' <div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a minute later. '' <div class="bookquote">``Ach, you said that to them!
<p/>And in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) presence?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>cried Sonia, frightened. '' Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I'm... dishonourable.... Ah, why did you say that?''
<p/>'' It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you, but because of your great suffering.
<p/>, that's true,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added almost solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing .
<p/>Isn't it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at the same time you know yourself -LRB-you've only to open your eyes-RRB- that you are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything?
<p/>Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on almost in a frenzy, <div class="bookquote">``how this shame and degradation can exist in you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings?
<p/>But you are a great sinner Isn't that fearful? It would be better, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But what would become of them?'' Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) with eyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) suggestion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) read it all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) must have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had thought out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) despair how to end it and so earnestly, that now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) scarcely wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) suggestion.
<p/>-LRB-The significance of his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) reproaches and his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) peculiar attitude to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) shame she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had, of course, not noticed either, and that, too, was clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>).-RRB-
<p/>Raskolnikov looked strangely at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had not even noticed the cruelty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) words. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw how monstrously the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and had long tortured her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>Only then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) realised what those poor little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna, knocking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) head against the wall in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) consumption, meant for Sonia.
<p/>But, nevertheless, it was clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) again that with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) character and the amount of education she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had after all received, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could not in any case remain so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was still confronted by the question, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) have remained so long in that position without going out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mind, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could not bring herself to jump into the water?
<p/>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knew that Sonia's position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not unique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) tinge of education, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) previous life might, one would have thought, have killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) at the first step on that revolting path.
<p/>'' What, what,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``could hitherto have hindered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) from putting an end to it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>What held her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) up--surely not depravity?
<p/>All that infamy had obviously only touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) heart; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw that.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are three ways before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``the canal, the madhouse, or... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns the heart to stone.
<p/>The last idea was the most revolting, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was a sceptic, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not help believing that the last end was the most likely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)... ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' But can that be true? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cried to himself.
<p/>Can that creature who has still preserved the purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) spirit be consciously drawn at last into that sink of filth and iniquity?
<p/>Can it be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has only been able to bear it till now, because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)?
<p/>'' Can the process already have begun? No, no, that cannot be! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cried, as Sonia had just before. ''
<p/>And if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has not gone out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mind... but who says she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has not gone out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mind?
<p/>No, what has kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) from the canal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children.... Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) senses?
<p/>How can she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is slipping and refuse to listen when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is told of danger?
<p/>Can one talk, can one reason as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) does? Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) expect a miracle? No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) does. Doesn't that all mean madness?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) stayed obstinately at that thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) liked that explanation indeed better than any other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) began looking more intently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>'' So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). Sonia did not speak; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stood beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) waiting for an answer.
<p/>'' What should I be without God? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) whispered rapidly, forcibly, glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' Ah, so that is it! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought. '' And what does God do for you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) asked, probing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) further.
<p/>Sonia was silent a long while, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could not answer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) weak chest kept heaving with emotion. '' Be silent!
<p/>Don't ask! You don't deserve!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cried suddenly, looking sternly and wrathfully at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). '' That's it, that's it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) repeated to himself.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) does everything,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) whispered quickly, looking down again. '' That's the way out! That's the explanation,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) decided, scrutinising her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft blue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that little body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) more and more strange, almost impossible.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is a religious maniac! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) repeated to himself. There was a book lying on the chest of drawers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) had noticed it every time he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) paced up and down the room. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) took it up and looked at it.
<p/>It was the New Testament in the Russian translation. It was bound in leather, old and worn. '' Where did you get that?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) across the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was still standing in the same place, three steps from the table.
<p/>'' It was brought me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) answered, as it were unwillingly, not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>). '' Who brought it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Lizaveta, I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lizaveta! strange! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) thought. Everything about Sonia seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) stranger and more wonderful every moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the pages.
<p/>'' Where is the story of Lazarus? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) asked suddenly. Sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was standing sideways to the table. '' Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me, Sonia. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) stole a glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>).
<p/>'' You are not looking in the right place.... It's in the fourth gospel,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) whispered sternly, without looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) sat down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) elbow on the table, leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) hand and looked away sullenly, prepared to listen.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Find it and read it to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) said. '' In three weeks' time they'll welcome me in the madhouse! I shall be there if I am not in a worse place,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) muttered to himself.
<p/>Sonia heard Raskolnikov's request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly to the table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) took the book however. '' Haven't you read it?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) asked, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) across the table. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) voice became sterner and sterner. '' Long ago.... When I was at school.
<p/>Read!'' '' And haven't you heard it in church?'' <div class="bookquote">``I... haven't been. Do you often go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>'' N-no,'' whispered Sonia. Raskolnikov smiled.
<p/>'' I understand.... And you won't go to your father's funeral to-morrow?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall. I was at church last week, too...
<p/>I had a requiem service.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' For whom? '' <div class="bookquote">``For Lizaveta. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was killed with an axe. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) nerves were more and more strained.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head began to go round. <div class="bookquote">``Were you friends with Lizaveta?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes.... She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was good... she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) used to come... not often...
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) couldn't.... We used to read together and... talk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) will see God. '' The last phrase sounded strange in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ears.
<p/>And here was something new again: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them--religious maniacs. '' I shall be a religious maniac myself soon!
<p/>It's infectious!'' <div class="bookquote">``Read! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) cried irritably and insistently. Sonia still hesitated. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) heart was throbbing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hardly dared to read to him (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) looked almost with exasperation at the <div class="bookquote">``unhappy lunatic.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What for? You don't believe?... ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) whispered softly and as it were breathlessly.
<p/>'' Read! I want you to,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) persisted. '' You used to read to Lizaveta. '' Sonia opened the book and found the place.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands were shaking, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) voice failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). Twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) tried to begin and could not bring out the first syllable.
<p/>'' Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany... '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) forced herself at last to read, but at the third word her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) voice broke like an overstrained string.
<p/>Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw this, the more roughly and irritably he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) insisted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) doing so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) understood only too well how painful it was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) to betray and unveil all that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) own .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) understood that these feelings really were her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) secret treasure , which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had kept perhaps for years, perhaps from childhood, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) lived with an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches.
<p/>But at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) with dread and suffering, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had a tormenting desire to read and to read to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might hear it, and to read now whatever might come of it!...
<p/>There was a catch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) breath. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) read this in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could see it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) intense emotion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) throat and went on reading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) went on to the nineteenth verse:
<p/>Then Martha as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) heard that Jesus was coming went and met Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>): but Mary sat still in the house.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>'' Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
<p/>'' But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee... '' Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) voice would quiver and break again.
<p/>'' Jesus said unto her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), thy brother shall rise again. '' Martha saith unto Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) shall rise again in the resurrection, at the last day.
<p/>Jesus said unto her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), I am the resurrection and the life: he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) that believeth in Me though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) were dead, yet shall he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) live.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) saith unto Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>),'' -LRB-And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and forcibly as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) were making a public confession of faith.-RRB-
<p/>'' '' And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this? '' '' Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God
<p/>Which should come into the world. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) stopped and looked up quickly at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), but controlling herself went on reading.
<p/>Raskolnikov sat without moving, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) elbows on the table and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes turned away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) read to the thirty-second verse. ''
<p/>Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fell down at His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) feet, saying unto Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), Lord if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
<p/>When Jesus therefore saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) groaned in the spirit and was troubled, <div class="bookquote">``And said, Where have ye laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>They said unto Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), Lord, come and see. '' Jesus wept. '' Then said the Jews, behold how He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)! ''
<p/>And some of them said, could not this Man which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov turned and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with emotion. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had known it! She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was trembling in a real physical fever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had expected it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense triumph came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy gave it power. The lines danced before her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was reading by heart.
<p/>At the last verse <div class="bookquote">``Could not this Man which opened the eyes of the blind...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) passionately reproduced the doubt, the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who in another moment would fall at His (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) feet as though struck by thunder, sobbing and believing...
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) --too, is blinded and unbelieving, he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>), too, will hear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>), too, will believe, yes, yes! At once, now,'' was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was dreaming, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was quivering with happy anticipation.
<p/>'' Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
<p/>Martha, the sister of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) that was dead, saith unto Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), Lord by this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) stinketh: for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hath been dead four days.
<p/>Jesus saith unto her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
<p/>'' Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) laid emphasis on the word four . '' '' Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.
<p/>And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.
<p/>And Jesus lifted up His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me. '' '' And when He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) thus had spoken, He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) that was dead came forth. '' -LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) were seeing it before her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eyes.-RRB-
<p/>'' Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) go.
<p/>'' Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did believed on Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>).
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could read no more, closed the book and got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chair quickly. '' That is all about the raising of Lazarus,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whispered severely and abruptly, and turning away
<p/>The candle-end was flickering out in the battered candlestick, dimly lighting up in the poverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely been reading together the eternal book.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood motionless, not daring to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes to him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) still trembled feverishly. Five minutes or more passed. ''
<p/>I came to speak of something,'' Raskolnikov said aloud, frowning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) got up and went to Sonia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in silence.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face was particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in it. '' I have abandoned my family to-day,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``my mother and sister.
<p/>I am not going to see them. I've broken with them completely. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>asked Sonia amazed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) recent meeting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother and sister had left a great impression which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could not analyse.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) news almost with horror. '' I have only you now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``Let us go together.... I've come to you, we are both accursed, let us go our way together!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes glittered <div class="bookquote">``as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) were mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>Sonia thought, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) turn. '' Go where? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) asked in alarm and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) involuntarily stepped back.
<p/>'' How do I know? I only know it's the same road, I know that and nothing more. It's the same goal!
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and understood nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) knew only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was terribly, infinitely unhappy. '' No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but I have understood.
<p/>I need you, that is why I have come to you.'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>whispered Sonia. '' You'll understand later. Haven't you done the same?
<p/>You, too, have transgressed... have had the strength to transgress. You have laid hands on yourself, you have destroyed a life... your own -LRB-it's all the same!-RRB-.
<p/>But you won't be able to stand it, and if you remain alone you'll go out of your mind like me.
<p/>You might have lived in spirit and understanding, but you'll end in the Hay Market.... You are like a mad creature already.
<p/>So we must go together on the same road! Let us go!'' <div class="bookquote">``What for? What's all this for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>said Sonia, strangely and violently agitated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) words.
<p/>You must look things straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cry that God won't allow it.
<p/>'' What for? Because you can't remain like this, that's why! What will happen, if you should really be taken to the hospital to-morrow?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is mad and in consumption, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)'ll soon die and the children? Do you mean to tell me Polenka won't come to grief?
<p/>Haven't you seen children here at the street corners sent out by their mothers to beg? I've found out where those mothers live and in what surroundings.
<p/>Children can't remain children there! At seven the child is vicious and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the image of Christ: `theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) bade us honour and love them, they are the humanity of the future...'' '' What's to be done, what's to be done?
<p/>'' repeated Sonia, weeping hysterically and wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands. '' What's to be done? Break what must be broken, once for all, that's all, and take the suffering on oneself.
<p/>What, you don't understand? You'll understand later.... Freedom and power, and above all, power! Over all trembling creation and all the ant-heap!
<p/>... That's the goal, remember that! That's my farewell message. Perhaps it's the last time I shall speak to you. If I don't come to-morrow, you'll hear of it all, and then remember these words.
<p/>And some day later on, in years to come, you'll understand perhaps what they meant. If I come to-morrow, I'll tell you who killed Lizaveta....
<p/>Good-bye. '' Sonia started with terror. '' Why, do you know who killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) asked, chilled with horror, looking wildly at him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>'' I know and will tell... you, only you. I have chosen you out. I'm not coming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to tell you.
<p/>I chose you out long ago to hear this, when your father talked of you and when Lizaveta was alive, I thought of it.
<p/>Good-bye, don't shake hands. To-morrow! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went out. Sonia gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as at a madman. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) herself was like one insane and felt it.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) head was going round. '' Good heavens, how does he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) know who killed Lizaveta? What did those words mean? It's awful!''
<p/>But at the same time the idea did not enter her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) head, not for a moment! '' Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must be terribly unhappy!...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother and sister.... What for? What has happened? And what had he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind? What did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) say to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) foot and said... said -LRB-yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had said it clearly-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not live without her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) jumped up from time to time, wept and wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hands, then sank again into feverish sleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading the gospel and him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)...
<p/>.... Oh, merciful heavens! '' Sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with pale face, with burning eyes... kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) feet, weeping.
<p/>On the other side of the door on the right, which divided Sonia's room from Madame Resslich's flat, was a room which had long stood empty.
<p/>A card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the canal advertising it to let.
<p/>Sonia had long been accustomed to the room's being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had been standing, listening at the door of the empty room.
<p/>When Raskolnikov went out he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own room which adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it to the door that led to Sonia's room.
<p/>The conversation had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) as interesting and remarkable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had greatly enjoyed it--so much so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) brought a chair that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) might not in the future, to-morrow, for instance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but might listen in comfort.
<p/>When next morning at eleven o'clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) name in to Porfiry Petrovitch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was surprised at being kept waiting so long: it was at least ten minutes before he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was summoned.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood in the waiting-room, and people, who apparently had nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), were continually passing to and fro before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>In the next room which looked like an office, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had no notion who or what Raskolnikov might be.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked uneasily and suspiciously about him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to see whether there was not some guard, some mysterious watch being kept on him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) escape.
<p/>But there was nothing of the sort: he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty details, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>).
<p/>The conviction grew stronger in him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) that if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of the earth, had seen everything, they would not have let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stand and wait like that.
<p/>CHAPTER V He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had expected that they would pounce upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might go where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked for them. And would they have waited till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elected to appear at eleven?
<p/>Either the man had not yet given information, or... or simply he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew nothing, had seen nothing -LRB-and how could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have seen anything?-RRB-
<p/>and so all that had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the day before was again a phantom exaggerated by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sick and overstrained imagination.
<p/>Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh conflict, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was suddenly aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was trembling--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt a rush of indignation at the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was trembling with fear at facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dreaded above all was meeting that man again; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with an intense, unmitigated hatred and was afraid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hatred might betray him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indignation was such that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ceased trembling at once; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made ready to go in with a cold and arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible, to watch and listen and for once at least to control his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) overstrained nerves.
<p/>This conjecture had begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) alarm and despair. At that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) study was a room neither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that stood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a bookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture, of polished yellow wood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) study. In the further wall there was a closed door, beyond it there were no doubt other rooms.
<p/>On Raskolnikov's entrance Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had come in and they remained alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) visitor with an apparently genial and good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that Raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been thrown out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) reckoning or caught in something very secret.
<p/>Come, sit down, old man... or perhaps you don't like to be called `my dear fellow' and `old man!'-- tout court ?
<p/>'' Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are... in our domain''... began Porfiry, holding out both hands to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' Please don't think it too familiar....
<p/>Here, on the sofa. '' Raskolnikov sat down, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' In our domain,'' the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase tout court , were all characteristic signs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) held out both hands to me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not give me one--he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) drew it back in time,'' struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suspiciously.
<p/>'' Both were watching each other, but when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away. '' I brought you this paper... about the watch.
<p/>Yes, yes, don't be uneasy, it's all right,'' Porfiry Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had said it he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) took the paper and looked at it.
<p/>Here it is. Is it all right or shall I copy it again?'' <div class="bookquote">``What? A paper? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yes, it's all right.
<p/>A minute later when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was talking of something else he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) took it from the table and put it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) bureau.
<p/>Nothing more is needed,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) declared with the same rapidity and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) laid the paper on the table. '' I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me... formally... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov was beginning again. '' Why did I put in 'I believe''' passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind in a flash. ''
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suddenly felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) uneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the first looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that this was fearfully dangerous.
<p/>Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ' I believe '? '' came in a second flash. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) nerves were quivering, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) emotion was increasing.
<p/>There's no hurry, there's no hurry,'' muttered Porfiry Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim, as it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table, at one moment avoiding Raskolnikov's suspicious glance, then again standing still and looking him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) straight in the face.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling from one side to the other and rebounding back.
<p/>'' It's bad, it's bad! I shall say too much again. '' '' Yes, yes, yes! '' We've plenty of time.
<p/>Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, a cigarette!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went on, offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) visitor a cigarette. '' You know I am receiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my government quarters.
<p/>But I am living outside for the time, I had to have some repairs done here. It's almost finished now.... Government quarters, you know, are a capital thing.
<p/>Eh, what do you think?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, a capital thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>answered Raskolnikov, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) almost ironically. '' A capital thing, a capital thing,'' repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had just thought of something quite different.
<p/>'' Yes, a capital thing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and stopping short two steps from him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) visitor.
<p/>Tell me, please,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and taking a kind of pleasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own insolence.
<p/>But this stirred Raskolnikov's spleen more than ever and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge. '' ''
<p/>I believe it's a sort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition--for all investigating lawyers--to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at least an irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man they are cross-examining, to disarm his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caution and then all at once to give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question.
<p/>Isn't that so? It's a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manuals of the art?'' '' Yes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about government quarters... eh?''
<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes and winked; a good-humoured, crafty look passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
<p/>The wrinkles on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead were smoothed out, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes contracted, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) features broadened and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all over and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face.
<p/>The latter forced himself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was laughing, broke into such a guffaw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned almost crimson, Raskolnikov's repulsion overcame all precaution; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) left off laughing, scowled and stared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) while his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) intentionally prolonged laughter lasted.
<p/>There was lack of precaution on both sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) visitor's face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with which the visitor received it.
<p/>The latter fact was very significant in Raskolnikov's eyes: he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been embarrassed just before either, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), Raskolnikov, had perhaps fallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in another moment would break upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)...
<p/>Porfiry Petrovitch,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began resolutely, though with considerable irritation, <div class="bookquote">``yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to you for some inquiries''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) laid special stress on the word <div class="bookquote">``inquiries'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-RRB-.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went straight to the point at once, rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) seat and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cap. '' '' I have come and if you have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow me to withdraw.
<p/>I have to be at the funeral of that man who was run over, of whom you... know also,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anger.
<p/>I have no time to spare... '' I am sick of it all, do you hear? and have long been. It's partly what made me ill.
<p/>In short,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouted, feeling that the phrase about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) illness was still more out of place, <div class="bookquote">``in short, kindly examine me or let me go, at once.
<p/>I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile, good-bye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now.
<p/>And if you must examine me, do so in the proper form! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I question you about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving off laughing.
<p/>'' Please don't disturb yourself,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) began fidgeting from place to place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down. '' There's no hurry, there's no hurry, it's all nonsense.
<p/>Oh, no, I'm very glad you've come to see me at last... I look upon you simply as a visitor. And as for my confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch.
<p/>It's my nerves, you tickled me so with your witty observation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with laughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time
<p/>Rodion Romanovitch? That is your name?... .... I'm often afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I shall think you are angry...
<p/>'' Raskolnikov did not speak; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) listened, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), still frowning angrily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did sit down, but still held his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cap.
<p/>I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch,'' Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) visitor's eyes.
<p/>You see, I'm a bachelor, a man of no consequence and not used to society; besides, I have nothing before me, I'm set, I'm running to seed and... and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in our Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but respect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before they can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb, they sit opposite each other and feel awkward.
<p/>people in high society always have their subjects of conversation, c'est de rigueur , but people of the middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied and awkward.
<p/>Whether it is the lack of public interest, or whether it is we are so honest we don't want to deceive one another, I don't know.
<p/>'' '' Everyone has subjects of conversation, ladies for instance... What is the reason of it? What do you think? Do put down your cap, it looks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable...
<p/>Raskolnikov put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cap and continued listening in silence with a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry Petrovitch.
<p/>I am so delighted... '' '' Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) really want to distract my attention with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) silly babble?'' <div class="bookquote">``I can't offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a friend?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry pattered on, <div class="bookquote">``and you know all these official duties... please don't mind my running up and down, excuse it, my dear fellow, I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is absolutely indispensable for me.
<p/>I always intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks, even Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily there; there you have it, modern science...
<p/>I'm always sitting and so glad to be moving about for five minutes... I suffer from my sedentary life... yes, yes....
<p/>But as for my duties here, inquiries and all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now... I assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for the interrogator than for the interrogated....
<p/>You made the observation yourself just now very aptly and wittily. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Raskolnikov had made no observation of the kind.-RRB- ''
<p/>One gets into a muddle! A regular muddle! One keeps harping on the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform
<p/>and we shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And as for our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agree with you.
<p/>Every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows that they begin by disarming him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) with irrelevant questions -LRB-as you so happily put it-RRB- and then deal him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) a knock-down blow, he-he-he!--your felicitous comparison, he-he!
<p/>So you really imagined that I meant by `government quarters'... he-he! You are an ironical person. Come. I won't go on!
<p/>Ah, by the way, yes! One word leads to another. You spoke of formality just now, apropos of the inquiry, you know.
<p/>But what's the use of formality? In many cases it's nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets a good deal more out of it.
<p/>One can always fall back on formality, allow me to assure you. And after all, what does it amount to? An examining lawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step.
<p/>The work of investigation is, so to speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!'' Porfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was almost running about the room, moving his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) fat little legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) right hand behind his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) back, while with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) left making gesticulations that were extraordinarily incongruous with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) words.
<p/>Raskolnikov suddenly noticed that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) ran about the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) seemed twice to stop for a moment near the door, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) were listening.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had simply babbled on uttering empty phrases, letting slip a few enigmatic words and again reverting to incoherence. '' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) expecting anything?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are certainly quite right about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry began gaily, looking with extraordinary simplicity at Raskolnikov -LRB-which startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and instantly put him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) guard-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``certainly quite right in laughing so wittily at our legal forms, he-he!
<p/>Some of these elaborate psychological methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheres too closely to the forms. Yes...
<p/>Well, if I recognise, or more strictly speaking, if I suspect someone or other to be a criminal in any case entrusted to me... you're reading for the law, of course, Rodion Romanovitch?''
 (<font color='red'><b>guard</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future--though don't suppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish about crime!
<p/>No, I simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if I took this man or that for a criminal, why, I ask, should I worry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prematurely, even though I had evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
<p/>In one case I may be bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in quite a different position, you know, so why shouldn't I let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walk about the town a bit?
<p/>I am talking of forms again. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I was...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' he-he-he! But I see you don't quite understand, so I'll give you a clearer example.
<p/>If I put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in prison too soon, I may very likely give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so to speak, moral support, he-he! You're laughing?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was sitting with compressed lips, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petrovitch's. ''
<p/>Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men are so different. You say `evidence'. Well, there may be evidence.
<p/>But evidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways. I am an examining lawyer and a weak man, I confess it.
<p/>I should like to make a chain of evidence such as twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof!
<p/>And if I shut him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up too soon--even though I might be convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the man, I should very likely be depriving myself of the means of getting further evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>By giving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so to speak, a definite position, I shall put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of suspense and set his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind at rest, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will retreat into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shell.
<p/>They say that at Sevastopol, soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright that the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once.
<p/>But when they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege, they were delighted, I am told and reassured, for the thing would drag on for two months at least.
<p/>I should like to make a proof, so to say, mathematically clear. And how? You're laughing, you don't believe me again?
<p/>But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, the general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended, for which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at all, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soon as it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and sometimes a case unlike any that's gone before.
<p/>Of course, you're right, too. You're right, you're right. These are special cases, I admit. Very comic cases of that sort sometimes occur.
<p/>If I leave one man quite alone, if I don't touch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and don't worry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know or at least suspect every moment that I know all about it and am watching him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) day and night, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in continual suspicion and terror, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be bound to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.
<p/>It may be so with a simple peasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a certain side, it's a dead certainty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll come of himself, or maybe do something which will make it as plain as twice two are four--it's delightful. For, my dear fellow, it's a very important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated.
<p/>And then there are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they are all sick, nervous and irritable!... And then how they all suffer from spleen!
<p/>That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us. And it's no anxiety to me, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) running about the town free!
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walk about for a bit! I know well enough that I've caught him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't escape me.
<p/>Where could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? A Pole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching and have taken measures.
<p/>Will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) escape into the depths of the country perhaps? But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants. A modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such strangers as our peasants.
<p/>He-he! But that's all nonsense, and on the surface. It's not merely that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has nowhere to run to, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is psychologically unable to escape me, he-he!
<p/>What an expression! Through a law of nature he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't escape me if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had anywhere to go. Have you seen a butterfly round a candle?
<p/>That's how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will keep circling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its attractions. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll begin to brood, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll weave a tangle round himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll worry himself to death!
<p/>What's more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will provide me with a mathematical proof--if I only give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long enough interval.... And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll keep circling round me, getting nearer and nearer and then--flop!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll fly straight into my mouth and I'll swallow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and that will be very amusing, he-he-he! You don't believe me?
<p/>'' Raskolnikov made no reply; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sat pale and motionless, still gazing with the same intensity into Porfiry's face. '' It's a lesson,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought, turning cold.
<p/>'' This is beyond the cat playing with a mouse, like yesterday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) can't be showing off his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) power with no motive... prompting me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is far too clever for that...
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) must have another object. What is it? It's all nonsense, my friend, you are pretending, to scare me! You've no proofs and the man I saw had no real existence.
<p/>You simply want to make me lose my head, to work me up beforehand and so to crush me. But you are wrong, you won't do it!
<p/>No, my friend, you are wrong, you won't do it even though you have some trap for me... let us see what you have in store for me.
<p/>But why give me such a hint? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) reckoning on my shattered nerves? '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal.
<p/>At times he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). This anger was what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) dreaded from the beginning. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) parched lips were flecked with foam, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) heart was throbbing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) realised that this was the best policy in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) position, because instead of saying too much he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would be irritating his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) enemy by his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) silence and provoking him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) into speaking too freely.
<p/>No, I see you don't believe me, you think I am playing a harmless joke on you,'' Porfiry began again, getting more and more lively, chuckling at every instant and again pacing round the room.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was still determined not to speak till the right moment. Anyhow, this was what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hoped for. '' ''
<p/>And to be sure you're right: God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in other people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, excuse an old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch
<p/>, you are a man still young, so to say, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, like all young people.
<p/>Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and that's for all the world like the old Austrian Hof-kriegsrath , as far as I can judge of military matters, that is: on paper they'd beaten Napoleon and taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) prisoner, and there in their study they worked it all out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, General Mack surrendered with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mack</b></font>) army,
<p/>he-he-he! I see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are laughing at a civilian like me, taking examples out of military history!
<p/>But I can't help it, it's my weakness. I am fond of military science. And I'm ever so fond of reading all military histories.
<p/>I've certainly missed my proper career. I ought to have been in the army, upon my word I ought. I shouldn't have been a Napoleon, but I might have been a major, he-he!
<p/>Well, I'll tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about this special case , I mean: actual fact and a man's temperament, my dear sir, are weighty matters
<p/>I--listen to an old man--am speaking seriously, Rodion Romanovitch'' -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who was scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice changed and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to shrink together-RRB-
<p/>and it's astonishing how they sometimes deceive the sharpest calculation! '' Moreover, I'm a candid man... am I a candid man or not?
<p/>What do you say? I fancy I really am: I tell you these things for nothing and don't even expect a reward for it, he-he!
<p/>Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid thing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of life, and what tricks it can play!
<p/>So that it sometimes is hard for a poor examining lawyer to know where he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) is, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)'s liable to be carried away by his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) own fancy, too, for you know he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) is a man after all!
<p/>But young people carried away by their own wit don't think of that `when they overstep all obstacles,' as you wittily and cleverly expressed it yesterday.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) will lie--that is, the man who is a special case , the incognito, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will lie well, in the cleverest fashion; you might think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wit, but at the most interesting, the most flagrant moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will faint.
<p/>But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal's temperament, worse luck for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)! Of course there may be illness and a stuffy room as well,
<p/>but anyway! Anyway he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s given us the idea! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) lied incomparably, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) didn't reckon on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) temperament. That's what betrays him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!
<p/>Another time he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will be carried away by his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paleness will be too natural , too much like the real thing, again he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has given us an idea!
<p/>Though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) questioner may be deceived at first, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will think differently next day if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not a fool, and, of course, it is like that at every step!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) puts himself forward where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not wanted, speaks continually when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts of allegorical allusions, he-he!
<p/>Comes and asks why didn't you take me long ago? he-he-he! And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man, the psychologist, the literary man.
<p/>The temperament reflects everything like a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are you so pale, Rodion Romanovitch?
<p/>Is the room stuffy? Shall I open the window?'' '' Oh, don't trouble, please,'' cried Raskolnikov and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suddenly broke into a laugh.
<p/>'' Please don't trouble. '' Porfiry stood facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), paused a moment and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) too laughed. Raskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hysterical laughter.
<p/>'' Porfiry Petrovitch,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began, speaking loudly and distinctly, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) legs trembled and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could scarcely stand. '' I see clearly at last that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister Lizaveta.
<p/>Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you find that you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then prosecute me, arrest me.
<p/>But I will not let myself be jeered at to my face and worried... '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lips trembled, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes glowed with fury and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) voice.
<p/>'' I won't allow it!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shouted, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fist down on the table. '' Do you hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch?
<p/>I won't allow it. '' <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens! What does it mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>cried Porfiry Petrovitch, apparently quite frightened. '' Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, what is the matter with you?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't allow it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov shouted again. '' Hush, my dear man! They'll hear and come in. Just think, what could we say to them?''
<p/>Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face close to Raskolnikov's. '' I won't allow it, I won't allow it,'' Raskolnikov repeated mechanically, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) too spoke in a sudden whisper.
<p/>Porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window. '' Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear fellow.
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was running to the door to call for some when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) found a decanter of water in the corner.
<p/>You're ill!'' <div class="bookquote">``Come, drink a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) whispered, rushing up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with the decanter. '' It will be sure to do you good.
<p/>'' Porfiry Petrovitch's alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov was silent and began looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with wild curiosity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not take the water, however. '' Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you'll drive yourself out of your mind, I assure you, ach, ach!
<p/>Have some water, do drink a little. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lips, but set it on the table again with disgust.
<p/>You'll bring back your illness again, my dear fellow,'' Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) still looked rather disconcerted.
<p/>'' Yes, you've had a little attack! '' Good heavens, you must take more care of yourself! Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me yesterday--
<p/>I know, I know, I've a nasty, ironical temper, but what they made of it!... Good heavens, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) came yesterday after you'd been.
<p/>We dined and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) talked and talked away, and I could only throw up my hands in despair! Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) come from you?
<p/>But do sit down, for mercy's sake, sit down!'' '' No, not from me, but I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) went to you and why he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) went,'' Raskolnikov answered sharply.
<p/>'' You knew?'' <div class="bookquote">``I knew. What of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you; I know about everything.
<p/>I know how you went to take a flat at night when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it.
<p/>Yes, I understand your state of mind at that time... but you'll drive yourself mad like that, upon my word! You'll lose your head!
<p/>You're full of generous indignation at the wrongs you've received, first from destiny, and then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness.
<p/>Only in that way you'll lose your head and Razumihin's, too; he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'s too good a man for such a position, you must know that.
<p/>That's so, isn't it? I have guessed how you feel, haven't I? You are ill and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is good and your illness is infectious for him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)...
<p/>I'll tell you about it when you are more yourself.... But do sit down, for goodness' sake. Please rest, you look shocking, do sit down.
<p/>In amazement he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who still seemed frightened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) looked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) with friendly solicitude.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov sat down; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) no longer shivered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was hot all over. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not believe a word he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt a strange inclination to believe.
<p/>Porfiry's unexpected words about the flat had utterly overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' How can it be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knows about the flat then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tells it me himself!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a case of morbid psychology,''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry went on quickly.
<p/>'' A man confessed to murder and how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought forward facts, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imposed upon everyone and why?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been partly, but only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given the murderers the opportunity, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sank into dejection, it got on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began imagining things and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) persuaded himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the murderer.
<p/>But at last the High Court of Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under proper care.
<p/>Why, my dear fellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse to work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about blood!
<p/>Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! I've studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry.
<p/>Just the same with bell-ringing.... It's all illness, Rodion Romanovitch! You have begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experienced doctor, what's the good of that fat fellow?
<p/>You are lightheaded! You were delirious when you did all this!'' For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round. '' Is it possible, is it possible,'' flashed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is still lying?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) rejected that idea, feeling to what a degree of fury it might drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), feeling that that fury might drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mad.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) can't be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) can't be. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cried, straining every faculty to penetrate Porfiry's game,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was quite myself, do you hear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you were not delirious, you were particularly emphatic about it!
<p/>If you were actually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business, would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession of your faculties?
<p/>I understand all you can tell me! A-ach!... Listen, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. And so emphatically and persistently? Would it be possible?
<p/>Quite impossible, to my thinking. If you had anything on your conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.
<p/>That's so, isn't it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov drew back on the sofa as Porfiry bent over him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and stared in silent perplexity at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Another thing about Razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) came of his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) own accord, to have concealed your part in it!
<p/>'' But you don't conceal it! You lay stress on his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) coming at your instigation. '' Raskolnikov had not done so.
<p/>You keep telling lies,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said slowly and weakly, twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lips into a sickly smile, <div class="bookquote">``you are trying again to show that you know all my game, that you know all I shall say beforehand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, conscious himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was not weighing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) words as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) ought.
<p/>A chill went down his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) back. '' '' You want to frighten me... or you are simply laughing at me... ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) still stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said this and again there was a light of intense hatred in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>You know perfectly well that the best policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible... to conceal as little as possible.
<p/>'' You keep lying,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) said. '' I don't believe you!'' <div class="bookquote">``What a wily person you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry tittered, <div class="bookquote">``there's no catching you; you've a perfect monomania.
<p/>But still you do believe me, you believe a quarter; I'll soon make you believe the whole, because I have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you good.
<p/>So you don't believe me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov's lips trembled. '' Yes, I do,'' went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov's arm genially, <div class="bookquote">``you must take care of your illness.
<p/>Besides, your mother and sister are here now; you must think of them. You must soothe and comfort them and you do nothing but frighten them...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What has that to do with you? How do you know it? What concern is it of yours? You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! You don't notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything.
<p/>No, you interrupted me, but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your suspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things.
<p/>I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a precious thing like that, a real fact -LRB-for it is a fact worth having-RRB-, and you see nothing in it!
<p/>From Razumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday. To return to bell-ringing, for instance. Why, if I had the slightest suspicion of you, should I have acted like that?
<p/>No, I should first have disarmed your suspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow -LRB-your expression-RRB- saying: `And what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten or nearly eleven at the murdered woman's flat
<p/>and why did you ring the bell and why did you ask about blood? And why did you invite the porters to go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant?'
<p/>That's how I ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to have taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhaps have arrested you, too...
<p/>so I have no suspicion of you, since I have not done that! But you can't look at it normally and you see nothing, I say again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail to perceive it. '' You are lying all the while,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know your object, but you are lying.
<p/>Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but preserving a good-humoured and ironical face, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) were not in the least concerned at Raskolnikov's opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>You did not speak like that just now and I cannot be mistaken!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am lying? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I am lying...
<p/>Prompting you and giving you every means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury, melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it?
<p/>Though, indeed, all those psychological means of defence are not very reliable and cut both ways: illness, delirium, I don't remember--that's all right, but why, my good sir, in your illness and in your delirium were you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others?
<p/>but how did I treat you just now, I, the examining lawyer? Ah! He-he-he! There may have been others, eh? He-he-he!
<p/>Briefly,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) said loudly and imperiously, rising to his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) feet and in so doing pushing Porfiry back a little, <div class="bookquote">``briefly, I want to know, do you acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' Tell me, Porfiry Petrovitch, tell me once for all and make haste!''
<p/>'' What a business I'm having with you! '' cried Porfiry with a perfectly good-humoured, sly and composed face. '' And why do you want to know
<p/>, why do you want to know so much, since they haven't begun to worry you? Why, you are like a child asking for matches!
<p/>And why are you so uneasy? Why do you force yourself upon us, eh? He-he-he!'' <div class="bookquote">``I repeat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov cried furiously, <div class="bookquote">``that I can't put up with it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With what? Uncertainty? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>interrupted Porfiry. '' Don't jeer at me! I won't have it! I tell you I won't have it.
<p/>I can't and I won't, do you hear, do you hear? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shouted, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fist down on the table again.
<p/>I am not joking,'' Porfiry whispered, but this time there was not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' Hush! Hush! They'll overhear! I warn you seriously, take care of yourself. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was peremptory, stern, frowning and for once laying aside all mystification.
<p/>Raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fell into actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) again obeyed the command to speak quietly, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.
<p/>I will not allow myself to be tortured,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) whispered, instantly recognising with hatred that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not help obeying the command and driven to even greater fury by the thought.
<p/>But this was only for an instant. '' '' Arrest me, search me, but kindly act in due form and don't play with me!
<p/>Don't dare!'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't worry about the form,''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry interrupted with the same sly smile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' I invited you to see me quite in a friendly way. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't want your friendship and I spit on it!
<p/>Do you hear? And, here, I take my cap and go. What will you say now if you mean to arrest me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cap and went to the door. '' And won't you see my little surprise? '' chuckled Porfiry, again taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) by the arm and stopping him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) at the door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened Raskolnikov. '' What surprise? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked, standing still and looking at Porfiry in alarm.
<p/>'' My little surprise, it's sitting there behind the door, he-he-he!'' -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pointed to the locked door.-RRB- '' I locked him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) should not escape.
<p/>'' '' What is it? Where? What?... '' Raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it, but it was locked.
<p/>'' It's locked, here is the key! '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) brought a key out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pocket. '' You are lying,'' roared Raskolnikov without restraint, <div class="bookquote">``you lie, you damned punchinello!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other door, not at all alarmed. '' I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I may betray myself to you...''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear Rodion Romanovitch. You are in a passion. Don't shout, I shall call the clerks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was ill and tried to work me into a frenzy to make me betray myself
<p/>, that was your object! Produce your facts! I understand it all. You've no evidence, you have only wretched rubbishly suspicions like Zametov's!
<p/>You knew my character, you wanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and deputies....
<p/>Are you waiting for them? eh! What are you waiting for? Where are they? Produce them?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why deputies, my good man?
<p/>What things people will imagine! And to do so would not be acting in form as you say , you don't know the business, my dear fellow....
<p/>And there's no escaping form, as you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry muttered, listening at the door through which a noise could be heard.
<p/>'' Ah, they're coming,'' cried Raskolnikov. '' You've sent for them! You expected them! Well, produce them all: your deputies, your witnesses, what you like!...
<p/>But at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for such a conclusion to their interview.
<p/>I am ready!'' CHAPTER VI When he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it. The noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened a little.
<p/>For an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there were several persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushing somebody back.
<p/>'' What is it?'' cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. '' Why, I gave orders... '' '' What is it? '' Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily.
<p/>'' The prisoner Nikolay has been brought,'' someone answered. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) is not wanted! Take him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) away! Let him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wait! What's he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) doing here?
<p/>Two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave a violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room.
<p/>How irregular! '' cried Porfiry, rushing to the door. '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)...'' began the same voice, and suddenly ceased. This man's appearance was at first sight very strange.
<p/>There was a determined gleam in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were being led to the scaffold.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young, slim, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features.
<p/>The man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had thrust back followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the room and succeeded in seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the shoulder; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stared straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as though seeing nothing. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) white lips were faintly twitching. Several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway.
<p/>Some of them tried to get in. All this took place almost instantaneously. '' Go away, it's too soon! Wait till you are sent for!...
<p/>Why have you brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so soon? '' Porfiry Petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed, and as it were thrown out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reckoning.
<p/>But Nikolay suddenly knelt down. '' What's the matter?'' cried Porfiry, surprised. '' I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer,'' Nikolay articulated suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.
<p/>For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb; even the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and stood immovable.
<p/>'' What is it?'' cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) momentary stupefaction. '' I... am the murderer,'' repeated Nikolay, after a brief pause.
<p/>'' What... you... what... whom did you kill? '' Porfiry Petrovitch was obviously bewildered. Nikolay again was silent for a moment.
<p/>'' Alyona Ivanovna and her (<font color='blue'><b>Nikolay</b></font>) sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I... killed... with an axe. Darkness came over me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) added suddenly, and was again silent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) still remained on his (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back the uninvited spectators.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner, staring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>), but stopped short, looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.
<p/>They instantly vanished and closed the door. '' You're in too great a hurry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shouted at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), almost angrily. ''
<p/>I didn't ask you what came over you.... Speak, did you kill them?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am the murderer.... I want to give evidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay</b></font>)</div>Nikolay pronounced.
<p/>'' Ach! What did you kill them with?'' '' An axe. I had it ready.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ach, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) is in a hurry!
<p/>Alone? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay</b></font>)</div>Nikolay did not understand the question. '' Did you do it alone?'' '' Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you ran downstairs like that at the time? The porters met you both!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' It was to put them off the scent... I ran after Mitka,'' Nikolay replied hurriedly, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had prepared the answer.
<p/>It's not his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) own tale he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) is telling,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) eyes rested on Raskolnikov again.
<p/>'' I knew it!'' cried Porfiry, with vexation. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had forgotten Raskolnikov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was a little taken aback. '' My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) flew up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``this won't do; I'm afraid you must go...
<p/>it's no good your staying... I will... you see, what a surprise!... Good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) by the arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to the door.
<p/>I suppose you didn't expect it?'' said Raskolnikov who, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had not yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) courage.
<p/>'' '' You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your hand is trembling! He-he!'' '' You're trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am; I didn't expect it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to be gone.
<p/>'' And your little surprise, aren't you going to show it to me? '' Raskolnikov said, sarcastically. '' Why, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) teeth are chattering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asks, he-he!
<p/>You are an ironical person! Come, till we meet!'' <div class="bookquote">``I believe we can say good-bye !''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>'' That's in God's hands,'' muttered Porfiry, with an unnatural smile.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people were looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). Among them he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw the two porters from the house, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had invited that night to the police station.
<p/>They stood there waiting. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was no sooner on the stairs than he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heard the voice of Porfiry Petrovitch behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it's in God's hands, but as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask you...
<p/>Turning round, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw the latter running after him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), out of breath. '' so we shall meet again, shan't we?'' And Porfiry stood still, facing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with a smile.
<p/>'' Shan't we?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) added again. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out. '' You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has just passed...
<p/>I lost my temper,'' began Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) courage that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt irresistibly inclined to display his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) coolness.
<p/>'' Don't mention it, don't mention it,'' Porfiry replied, almost gleefully. '' I myself, too... I have a wicked temper, I admit it!
<p/>But we shall meet again. If it's God's will, we may see a great deal of one another.'' '' And will get to know each other through and through?'' added Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' Yes; know each other through and through,'' assented Porfiry Petrovitch, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' Now you're going to a birthday party?'' <div class="bookquote">``To a funeral.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get well.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to wish you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>said Raskolnikov, who had begun to descend the stairs, but looked back again.
<p/>'' I should like to wish you success, but your office is such a comical one.'' <div class="bookquote">``Why comical? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) seemed to prick up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) ears at this.
<p/>You must have been at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) day and night, proving to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was the murderer, and now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) has confessed, you'll begin vivisecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) again. '
<p/>'' Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay psychologically, after your fashion, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) confessed! You are lying,' you'll say. '
<p/>You are not the murderer! You can't be! It's not your own tale you are telling!' You must admit it's a comical business!''
<p/>'' He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) own tale he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was telling?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I help noticing it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! You've really a playful mind! And you always fasten on the comic side...
<p/>he-he! They say that was the marked characteristic of Gogol, among the writers.'' '' Yes, of Gogol.'' '' Yes, of Gogol....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gogol</b></font>) was so muddled and bewildered that on getting home he (<font color='blue'><b>Gogol</b></font>) sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to collect his (<font color='blue'><b>Gogol</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gogol</b></font>) did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gogol</b></font>) was stupefied; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gogol</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gogol</b></font>) confession was something inexplicable, amazing--something beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Gogol</b></font>) understanding.
<p/>I shall look forward to meeting you.'' '' So shall I.'' Raskolnikov walked straight home. But Nikolay's confession was an actual fact.
<p/>The consequences of this fact were clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) at once, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they would be after him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) again.
<p/>Till then, at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was free and must do something for himself, for the danger was imminent. But how imminent?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) position gradually became clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). Remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) recent scene with Porfiry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not help shuddering again with horror.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had already partly shown his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand, and no one knew better than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry's <div class="bookquote">``lead''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>had been for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not yet know all Porfiry's aims, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not see into all his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) calculations. A little more
<p/>Knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) nervous temperament and from the first glance seeing through him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was bound to win.
<p/>There's no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised himself seriously, but no facts had come to light as yet; there was nothing positive.
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) might have given himself away completely, circumstantially. But was he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) taking a true view of the position? Wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mistaken?
<p/>What had Porfiry been trying to get at? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) really some surprise prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)? And what was it? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) really been expecting something or not?
<p/>Porfiry had shown almost all his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cards--of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had risked something in showing them--and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had really had anything up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sleeve -LRB-Raskolnikov reflected-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would have shown that, too.
<p/>How would they have parted if it had not been for the unexpected appearance of Nikolay? What was that <div class="bookquote">``surprise'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>? Was it a joke?
<p/>Had it meant anything? Could it have concealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) yesterday's visitor? What had become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)?
<p/>Where was he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to-day? If Porfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).... He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sat on the sofa with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knees and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face hidden in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was still shivering nervously. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) got up, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cap, thought a minute, and went to the door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) might consider himself out of danger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had a sudden sense almost of joy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would be too late for the funeral, of course, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would be in time for the memorial dinner, and there at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would see Sonia.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for a moment on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lips. '' To-day! To-day,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) repeated to himself.
<p/>'' Yes, to-day! So it must be... '' But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was about to open the door, it began opening of itself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) started and moved back. The door opened gently and slowly, and there suddenly appeared a figure--yesterday's visitor from underground .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was exactly the same as yesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change in his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) face; he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) looked dejected and sighed deeply.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had only put his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) hand up to his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) cheek and leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) head on one side he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) would have looked exactly like a peasant woman.
<p/>The man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking, and took a step forward into the room. '' What do you want?'' asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror.
<p/>The man was still silent, but suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) bowed down almost to the ground, touching it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) finger. '' What is it?'' cried Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' I have sinned,'' the man articulated softly. <div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``By evil thoughts. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They looked at one another. '' I was vexed.
<p/>When you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters go to the police station and asked about the blood, I was vexed that they let you go and took you for drunken.
<p/>I was so vexed that I lost my sleep. And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for you...
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Who came?''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect. '' I did, I've wronged you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then you come from that house?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was standing at the gate with them... don't you remember? We have carried on our trade in that house for years past.
<p/>And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came clearly before Raskolnikov's mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) recollected that there had been several people there besides the porters, women among them.
<p/>We cure and prepare hides, we take work home... most of all I was vexed... ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered one voice had suggested taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) straight to the police-station.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not recall the face of the speaker, and even now he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not recognise it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had turned round and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) some answer....
<p/>The most awful thought was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himself on account of such a trivial circumstance.
<p/>So this was the solution of yesterday's horror. So this man could tell nothing except his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asking about the flat and the blood stains.
<p/>So Porfiry, too, had nothing but that delirium , no facts but this psychology which cuts both ways , nothing positive.
<p/>So if no more facts come to light -LRB-and they must not, they must not!-RRB- then... then what can they do to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
<p/>How can they convict him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), even if they arrest him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not known about it before.
<p/>'' Was it you who told Porfiry... that I'd been there? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, struck by a sudden idea. '' What Porfiry?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The head of the detective department? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. The porters did not go there, but I went. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I got there two minutes before you.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Why, in the next room. I was sitting there all the time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>began the man; <div class="bookquote">``for it's too late, said they, and maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be angry that we did not come at the time.

<p/>And finding out yesterday where to go, I went to-day. The first time I went he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wasn't there, when I came an hour later he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't see me.
<p/>I informed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of everything, just as it happened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began skipping about the room and punching himself on the chest. '
<p/>I went the third time, and they showed me in. What do you scoundrels mean by it? If I'd known about it I should have arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!'
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran out, called somebody and began talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the corner, then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned to me, scolding and questioning me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scolded me a great deal; and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) everything, and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that you didn't dare to say a word in answer to me yesterday and that you didn't recognise me.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and getting angry and running about, and when you were announced he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me to go into the next room. '
<p/>Sit there a bit,' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. ' Don't move, whatever you may hear.' And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set a chair there for me and locked me in. '
<p/>Perhaps,' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, 'I may call you.' And when Nikolay'd been brought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let me out as soon as you were gone. '
<p/>I shall send for you again and question you,' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. '' '' And did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) question Nikolay while you were there?''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got rid of me as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did of you, before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke to Nikolay. '' The man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, touching the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger.
<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said this, the man bowed down again, but not to the ground, turned slowly and went out of the room.
<p/>It all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways,'' repeated Raskolnikov, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went out more confident than ever.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``May God forgive you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>answered Raskolnikov. '' '' Now we'll make a fight for it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, with a malicious smile, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went down the stairs.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) malice was aimed at himself; with shame and contempt he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) recollected his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``cowardice. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>PART V CHAPTER I The morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.
<p/>Intensely unpleasant as it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was forced little by little to accept as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) only the day before fantastic and incredible.
<p/>The black snake of wounded vanity had been gnawing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart all night. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch immediately looked in the looking-glass.
<p/>However his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of late, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would find another bride and, perhaps, even a better one.
<p/>But coming back to the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) present position, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned aside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) was staying.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) was afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) had jaundice. That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) young friend's account.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) anger was redoubled when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) reflected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) ought not to have told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday's interview.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) had set down a good many points against him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) of late. That was the second mistake he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) had made in temper, through impulsiveness and irritability....
<p/>Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness followed another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) even found a hitch awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) legal case in the senate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat which had been taken in view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) approaching marriage and was being redecorated at his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman, would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr Petrovitch would be giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) back the flat practically redecorated.
<p/>In the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the flat.
<p/>'' Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?'' Pyotr Petrovitch ground his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) teeth and at the same time once more he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) had a gleam of desperate hope.
<p/>'' Can all that be really so irrevocably over? Is it no use to make another effort?'' The thought of Dounia sent a voluptuous pang through his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) endured anguish at that moment, and if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it, Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.
<p/>It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov's room, <div class="bookquote">``and why on earth was I such a Jew?
<p/>I meant to keep them without a penny so that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!
<p/>If I'd spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and all that sort of trash from Knopp's and the English shop, my position would have been better and... stronger!
<p/>They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to do it!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lebeziatnikov/Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>It was false economy! foo! They could not have refused me so easily! And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man who has hitherto been so generous and delicate?
<p/>.... H'm! I've made a blunder. '' And grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a fool--but not aloud, of course.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. The preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna's excited his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) curiosity as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard about it the day before; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fancied, indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been invited, but absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own cares he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had paid no attention.
<p/>Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy laying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the lodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>), Pyotr Petrovitch, was not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) was the most important of the lodgers.
<p/>Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them
<p/>; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) room, or rather Lebeziatnikov's, somewhat thoughtful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests. Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning.
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) from the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) came to stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) and at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) seemed somewhat afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) had not come to stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) arrival in Petersburg simply from parsimony, though that had been perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) chief object.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) had heard of Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) ward, as a leading young progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting circles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces.
<p/>These powerful omniscient circles who despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) a peculiar but quite vague alarm.
<p/>The attitude of Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural. It had impressed Pyotr Petrovitch. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had not, of course, been able to form even an approximate notion of what they meant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), like everyone, had heard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) exaggerated and distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree.
<p/>What for many years past he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had feared more than anything was being shown up and this was the chief ground for his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) continual uneasiness at the thought of transferring his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) business to Petersburg.
<p/>Some years before, when he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was just entering on his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) own career, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) had come upon two cases in which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), had been cruelly shown up.
<p/>One instance had ended in great scandal for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious trouble.
<p/>For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the subject as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of <div class="bookquote">``our younger generation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) visit to Raskolnikov he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) had succeeded in picking up some current phrases.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) was afraid of this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace simpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch.
<p/>Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>), it would not have allayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) uneasiness.
<p/>All the doctrines, the ideas, the systems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) had no interest for him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) own object--he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) simply wanted to find out at once what was happening here .
<p/>Had these people any power or not? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) anything to fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>)?
<p/>And what precisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) somehow make up to them and get round them if they really were powerful?
<p/>Was this the thing to do or not? Couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) gain something through them? In fact hundreds of questions presented themselves.
<p/>Andrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little man, with strangely flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) was very proud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) was a clerk and had almost always something wrong with his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) was rather soft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) little figure.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) did not get drunk and paid regularly for his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) lodgings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) was one of the numerous and varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited, half-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve, however sincerely.
<p/>Andrey Semyonovitch really was rather stupid; he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) attached himself to the cause of progress and <div class="bookquote">``our younger generation''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from enthusiasm. Though Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>), too, was beginning to dislike Pyotr Petrovitch.
<p/>However simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) began to see that Pyotr Petrovitch was duping him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) and secretly despising him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>), and that ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) was not the right sort of man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) had tried expounding to him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) the system of Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to listen too sarcastically and even to be rude.
<p/>The fact was he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) had begun instinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace simpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) had no connections of any consequence even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) own circle, but had simply picked things up third-hand; and that very likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) did not even know much about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) own work of propaganda, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) was in too great a muddle.
<p/>It must be noted, by the way, that Pyotr Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) had not protested, for instance, when Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) for being ready to contribute to the establishment of the new <div class="bookquote">``commune,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>or to abstain from christening his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a month after marriage, and so on.
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) own praises that he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) did not disdain even such virtues when they were attributed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some five-per-cent bonds and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) sat down to the table and counted over bundles of notes.
<p/>Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank notes with indifference and even contempt.
<p/>Nothing would have convinced Pyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch could really look on the money unmoved, and the latter, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr Petrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) and was, perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) young friend by reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) inferiority and the great difference between them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) incredibly inattentive and irritable, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>), Andrey Semyonovitch, began enlarging on his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) favourite subject, the foundation of a new special ``commune.
<p/>The brief remarks that dropped from Pyotr Petrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame betrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony.
<p/>But the <div class="bookquote">``humane''  (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>Andrey Semyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch's ill-humour to his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) recent breach with Dounia and he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) was burning with impatience to discourse on that theme.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) had something progressive to say on the subject which might console his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) worthy friend and <div class="bookquote">``could not fail''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>to promote his (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) development.
<p/>This happened on both sides unconsciously. '' A fine person he (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovitch</b></font>) would be to show anyone up! '' '' There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that... at the widow's, isn't there?''
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly, interrupting Andrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting passage. '' Why, don't you know? Why, I was telling you last night what I think about all such ceremonies.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on this feast all the money she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) got from that other fool, Raskolnikov.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) invited you too, I heard. You were talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) yesterday...''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was surprised just now as I came through at the preparations there, the wines!
<p/>Several people are invited. It's beyond everything! '' continued Pyotr Petrovitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the conversation.
<p/>'' What? You say I am asked too? When was that? I don't remember. But I shan't go. Why should I?
<p/>I only said a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) in passing yesterday of the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) obtaining a year's salary as a destitute widow of a government clerk.
<p/>I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) has invited me on that account, hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)? He-he-he!'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't intend to go either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>said Lebeziatnikov. ''
<p/>I should think not, after giving her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) a thrashing! You might well hesitate, he-he!'' <div class="bookquote">``Who thrashed? Whom? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>cried Lebeziatnikov, flustered and blushing.
<p/>so that's what your convictions amount to... and the woman question, too, wasn't quite sound, he-he-he!'' and Pyotr Petrovitch, as though comforted, went back to clicking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) beads.
<p/>'' Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. I heard so yesterday... '' It's all slander and nonsense! '' cried Lebeziatnikov, who was always afraid of allusions to the subject.
<p/>'' It was not like that at all, it was quite different. You've heard it wrong; it's a libel. I was simply defending myself.
<p/>It's permissable for anyone, I should hope, to defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me on principle, for it's an act of despotism.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) rushed at me first with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) nails, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pulled out all my whiskers.... What was I to do? I simply pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) back.''
<p/>'' He-he-he! '' Luzhin went on laughing maliciously. '' You keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself....
<p/>You don't understand; I used to think, indeed, that if women are equal to men in all respects, even in strength -LRB-as is maintained now-RRB- there ought to be equality in that, too.
<p/>Of course, I reflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise, for there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is unthinkable... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality in fighting.
<p/>I am not so stupid... though, of course, there is fighting... there won't be later, but at present there is... confound it!
<p/>But that's nonsense and it has nothing, nothing whatever to do with the woman question! How muddled one gets with you!
<p/>It's not on that account that I am not going. I am not going on principle, not to take part in the revolting convention of memorial dinners, that's why!
<p/>Though, of course, one might go to laugh at it.... I am sorry there won't be any priests at it. I should certainly go if there were.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you would sit down at another man's table and insult it and those who invited you. Eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not insult, but protest.
<p/>I should do it with a good object. I might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda. It's a duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the more harshly, perhaps, the better.
<p/>I might drop a seed, an idea.... And something might grow up from that seed. How should I be insulting them?
<p/>They might be offended at first, but afterwards they'd see I'd done them a service. You know, Terebyeva -LRB-who is in the community now-RRB- was blamed because when she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) family and... devoted...
<p/>herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) father and mother that she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) wouldn't go on living conventionally and was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh, that she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) might have spared them and have written more kindly.
<p/>Varents had been married seven years, she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) two children, she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) husband straight out in a letter: 'I have realised that I cannot be happy with you.
<p/>I can never forgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there is another organisation of society by means of the communities.
<p/>I have only lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have given myself and with whom I am establishing a community.
<p/>I think that's all nonsense and there's no need of softness; on the contrary, what's wanted is protest. I speak plainly because I consider it dishonest to deceive you.

<p/>And if ever I regretted the death of my father and mother, it is now, and I sometimes think if my parents were living what a protest I would have aimed at them!
<p/>I would have done something on purpose... I would have shown them! I would have astonished them! I am really sorry there is no one!''
<p/>Well, be that as you will,'' Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted, <div class="bookquote">``but tell me this; do you know the dead man's daughter, the delicate-looking little thing?

<p/>Setting aside the general question of chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed prejudices, I fully accept her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) chastity with me, because that's for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to decide.
<p/>Of course if she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) were to tell me herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) wanted me, I should think myself very lucky, because I like the girl very much; but as it is, no one has ever treated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more courteously than I, with more respect for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dignity...

<p/>Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider deserving of contempt, you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow creature.
<p/>Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is in such a position, but it's another question. Quite another question! You simply despise her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). You don't know what a character she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is!
<p/>I am only sorry that of late she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I used to lend them to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>I am sorry, too, that with all the energy and resolution in protesting--which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has already shown once--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has little self-reliance, little, so to say, independence, so as to break free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas.
<p/>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thoroughly understands some questions, for instance about kissing of hands, that is, that it's an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, because it's a sign of inequality.
<p/>We had a debate about it and I described it to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) listened attentively to an account of the workmen's associations in France, too.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of the community the right to enter another member's room, whether man or woman, at any time... and we decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div><p/>Lebeziatnikov was really angry. '' You are always thinking of something unpleasant,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) cried with aversion. <div class="bookquote">``Tfoo!

<p/>I've often maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till he (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) has a firm faith in the system.
<p/>Tfoo! And tell me, please, what do you find so shameful even in cesspools? I should be the first to be ready to clean out any cesspool you like.
<p/>And it's not a question of self-sacrifice, it's simply work, honourable, useful work which is as good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a Pushkin, because it is more useful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What do you mean by `more honourable'? I don't understand such expressions to describe human activity. '
<p/>More honourable,' `nobler'--all those are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is of use to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: useful !
<p/>You can snigger as much as you like, but that's so!'' Pyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) had finished counting the money and was putting it away.
<p/>But some of the notes he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) left on the table. The <div class="bookquote">``cesspool question''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had already been a subject of dispute between them.
<p/>What was absurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while it amused Luzhin and at that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) particularly wanted to anger his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) young friend.
<p/>It's your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-humoured and annoying,'' blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``independence''  (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``protests
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>did not venture to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still behaved to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) with some of the respect habitual in earlier years.
<p/>You'd better tell me this,'' Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted with haughty displeasure, <div class="bookquote">``can you... or rather are you really friendly enough with that young person to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) to step in here for a minute?

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What for? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise. '' Oh, I want to. I am leaving here to -day or to-morrow and therefore I wanted to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) about...
<p/>However, you may be present during the interview. It's better you should be, indeed. For there's no knowing what you might imagine.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I shan't imagine anything. I only asked and, if you've anything to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>), nothing is easier than to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) in.
<p/>I'll go directly and you may be sure I won't be in your way. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>Five minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was always shy in such circumstances and was always afraid of new people, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had been as a child and was even more so now....
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch met her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``politely and affably,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) opinion was suitable for a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) respectability and weight in dealing with a creature so young and so interesting as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) came in very much surprised and overcome with shyness as usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) hastened to <div class="bookquote">``reassure''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) sit down facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) at the table.
<p/>Sonia sat down, looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)--at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes lying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes remained riveted on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Lebeziatnikov was moving to the door. Pyotr Petrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov. '' Is Raskolnikov in there?
<p/>Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) come? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) in a whisper. '' Raskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) is there. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) just come in....
<p/>Why?'' '' Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave me alone with this... young woman.
<p/>I only want a few words with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but God knows what they may make of it. I shouldn't like Raskolnikov to repeat anything....
<p/>You understand what I mean?'' <div class="bookquote">``I understand! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>Lebeziatnikov saw the point. '' Yes, you are right.... Of course, I am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy, but... still, you are right.
<p/>Certainly I'll stay. I'll stand here at the window and not be in your way... I think you are right... ''
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite Sonia, looked attentively at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and assumed an extremely dignified, even severe expression, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``don't you make any mistake, madam.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Sonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment. '' In the first place, Sofya Semyonovna, will you make my excuses to your respected mamma....
<p/>That's right, isn't it? Katerina Ivanovna stands in the place of a mother to you?'' Pyotr Petrovitch began with great dignity, though affably.
<p/>It was evident that his (<font color='blue'><b>mamma</b></font>) intentions were friendly. '' Quite so, yes; the place of a mother,'' Sonia answered, timidly and hurriedly.
<p/>Through inevitable circumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in spite of your mamma's kind invitation.''
<p/>'' Then will you make my apologies to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)? '' Yes... I'll tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)... at once. '' And Sonia hastily jumped up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) seat.
<p/>Wait, that's not all,'' Pyotr Petrovitch detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) simplicity and ignorance of good manners, <div class="bookquote">``and you know me little, my dear Sofya Semyonovna, if you suppose I would have ventured to trouble a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself only.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes rested again for an instant on the grey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that remained on the table, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) quickly looked away and fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>I have another object. '' Sonia sat down hurriedly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) felt it horribly indecorous, especially for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) , to look at another person's money.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a yellow stone on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) middle finger.
<p/>But suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked away and, not knowing where to turn, ended by staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight in the face.
<p/>After a pause of still greater dignity he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) continued. '' I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with Katerina Ivanovna, poor woman.
<p/>That was sufficient to enable me to ascertain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is in a position--preternatural, if one may so express it. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes... preternatural... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>Sonia hurriedly assented. '' Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, ill.'' ``Yes, simpler and more comprehen...
<p/>So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak compassion, I should be glad to be of service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) in any way, foreseeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) unfortunate position.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me to ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>Sonia rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) feet, <div class="bookquote">``did you say something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) yesterday of the possibility of a pension?
<p/>yes, ill.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite so. I believe the whole of this poverty-stricken family depends now entirely on you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) told me you had undertaken to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) one.
<p/>I merely hinted at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had died in the service--if only she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has patronage...
<p/>but apparently your late parent had not served his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) full term and had not indeed been in the service at all of late.
<p/>In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be very ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance in that case, far from it....
<p/>Was that true?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not in the slightest, and indeed it's an absurdity! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is dreaming of a pension already, he-he-he!
<p/>... A go-ahead lady! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is. For she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is credulous and good-hearted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) believes everything from the goodness of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart and...
<p/>and... and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is like that... yes... You must excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>said Sonia, and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) got up to go. ''
<p/>But you haven't heard what I have to say. '' '' No, I haven't heard,'' muttered Sonia. '' Then sit down.
<p/>Seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) position with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) unfortunate little ones, I should be glad, as I have said before, so far as lies in my power, to be of service, that is, so far as is in my power, not more.
<p/>One might for instance get up a subscription for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), or a lottery, something of the sort, such as is always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous of assisting people.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was terribly confused; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) sat down again a third time. '' It was of that I intended to speak to you; it might be done.
<p/>'' '' Yes, yes... God will repay you for it,'' faltered Sonia, gazing intently at Pyotr Petrovitch. '' It might be, but we will talk of it later.
<p/>We might begin it to-day, we will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak. Come to me at seven o'clock.
<p/>But there is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and for which I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here.
<p/>Mr. Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. In my opinion money cannot be, indeed it's unsafe to put it into Katerina Ivanovna's own hands.
<p/>The dinner to-day is a proof of that. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and...
<p/>well, boots or shoes, or anything; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even, I believe, Madeira and... and coffee. I saw it as I passed through.
<p/>It's absurd, really, and so, to my thinking, a subscription ought to be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money, but only you, for instance.
<p/>To-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they won't have a crust of bread. Am I right?'' '' I don't know... this is only to-day, once in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) life....
<p/>but just as you think and I shall be very, very... they will all be... and God will reward... and the orphans...
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was so anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory.... And she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) is very sensible... '' Sonia burst into tears.
<p/>Very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you accept for the benefit of your relation the small sum that I am able to spare, from me personally.
<p/>'' I am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in connection with it. Here... having so to speak anxieties of my own, I cannot do more...
<p/>'' And Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note carefully unfolded. Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped up, muttered something and began taking leave.
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) ceremoniously to the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed, and returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion.
<p/>All this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the room, anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when Sonia had gone he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) walked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' I heard and saw everything,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) said, laying stress on the last verb. '' That is honourable, I mean to say, it's humane!
<p/>And although I cannot, I confess, in principle sympathise with private charity, for it not only fails to eradicate the evil but even promotes it, yet I must admit that I saw your action with pleasure--yes, yes, I like it.
<p/>You wanted to avoid gratitude, I saw! '' '' That's all nonsense,'' muttered Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted, looking carefully at Lebeziatnikov.
<p/>A man who has suffered distress and annoyance as you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others, such a man... even though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is making a social mistake--is still deserving of respect!
<p/>'' No, it's not nonsense! I did not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr Petrovitch, especially as according to your ideas...
<p/>How distressed you are for instance by your ill-luck yesterday,'' cried the simple-hearted Lebeziatnikov, who felt a return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch.
<p/>oh, what a drawback your ideas are to you! '' And, what do you want with marriage, with legal marriage, my dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch?
<p/>Well, you may beat me if you like, but I am glad, positively glad it hasn't come off, that you are free, that you are not quite lost for humanity....
<p/>Because I don't want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and to bring up another man's children, that's why I want legal marriage,'' Luzhin replied in order to make some answer.
<p/>Why do you cling to this legality of marriage? you see, I've spoken my mind!'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed preoccupied by something.
<p/>Children are a social question and a question of first importance, I agree; but the question of children has another solution.
<p/>'' Children? You referred to children,'' Lebeziatnikov started off like a warhorse at the trumpet call. '' Some refuse to have children altogether, because they suggest the institution of the family.
<p/>We'll speak of children later, but now as to the question of honour, I confess that's my weak point. That horrid, military, Pushkin expression is unthinkable in the dictionary of the future.
<p/>What does it mean indeed? It's nonsense, there will be no deception in a free marriage! That is only the natural consequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest.
<p/>So that indeed it's not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose an absurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of it.
<p/>I should say to my wife: `My dear, hitherto I have loved you, now I respect you, for you've shown you can protest!'
<p/>I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage, but it's simply a despicable consequence of a despicable position in which both are humiliated.
<p/>You laugh! That's because you are incapable of getting away from prejudices. Confound it all! When the deception is open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it's unthinkable.
<p/>Your wife will only prove how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) respects you by considering you incapable of opposing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) happiness and avenging yourself on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) new husband.
<p/>I mean if I were to marry, legally or not, it's just the same, I should present my wife with a lover if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not found one for herself. '
<p/>Damn it all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married, pfoo! My dear,' I should say, 'I love you, but even more than that I desire you to respect me.
<p/>See!' Am I not right?'' Pyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) listened, but without much merriment. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) hardly heard it indeed. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was preoccupied with something else and even Lebeziatnikov at last noticed it.
<p/>It would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna's disordered brain.
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected upon it afterwards. CHAPTER II Nearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov's funeral, were wasted upon it.
<p/>Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to honour the memory of the deceased <div class="bookquote">``suitably,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>that all the lodgers, and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) was in no way their inferior, and perhaps very much their superior,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amalia Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>and that no one had the right ``to turn up his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) nose at him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>).
<p/>Perhaps the chief element was that peculiar <div class="bookquote">``poor man's pride,''  (<font color='red'><b>chief</b></font>)</div>which compels many poor people to spend their last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order to do <div class="bookquote">``like other people,''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>and not to ``be looked down upon.
<p/>It is very probable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at the moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those <div class="bookquote">``wretched contemptible lodgers''  (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div>that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) knew <div class="bookquote">``how to do things, how to entertain''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had been brought up <div class="bookquote">``in a genteel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) might almost say aristocratic colonel's family''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and had not been meant for sweeping floors and washing the children's rags at night.
<p/>Even the poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous craving.
<p/>And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) might have been killed by circumstance, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) spirit could not have been broken, that is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) could not have been intimidated, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) will could not be crushed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) could not be said to be insane, but for a year past she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had been so harassed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mind might well be overstrained.
<p/>'' '' Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mind was unhinged. The later stages of consumption are apt
<p/>, doctors tell us, to affect the intellect. There was no great variety of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wine there was.
<p/>Besides the traditional rice and honey, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of pancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna's kitchen.
<p/>There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest quality but in sufficient quantity. Two samovars were boiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been stranded at Madame Lippevechsel's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) promptly put himself at Katerina Ivanovna's disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before running about as fast as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) legs could carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), and very anxious that everyone should be aware of it.
<p/>For every trifle he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) ran to Katerina Ivanovna, even hunting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) out at the bazaar, at every instant called her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) '' Pani .
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was heartily sick of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) before the end, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had declared at first that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) could not have got on without this <div class="bookquote">``serviceable and magnanimous man.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would invent various circumstances to the credit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) new acquaintance and quite genuinely believe in their reality.
<p/>Then all of a sudden she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the person she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had only a few hours before been literally adoring.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from continual failures and misfortunes she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had come to desire so keenly that all should live in peace and joy and should not dare to break the peace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) almost to frenzy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and fancies to cursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) fate and raving, and knocking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) head against the wall.
<p/>Amalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in Katerina Ivanovna's eyes and was treated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) with extraordinary respect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart and soul into the preparations.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had undertaken to lay the table, to provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) kitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hands and gone herself to the cemetery.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' It was one of Katerina Ivanovna's characteristics to paint everyone she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) met in the most glowing colours. Everything had been well done.
<p/>Even the table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses were, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers, but the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna, feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) work well, had put on a black silk dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some pride.
<p/>This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for some reason: <div class="bookquote">``as though the table could not have been laid except by Amalia Ivanovna!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div><p/>Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) be stuck up, the stupid German, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was mistress of the house, and had consented as a favour to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) poor lodgers!
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna's father who had been a colonel and almost a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and then anyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have been allowed into the kitchen.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) feelings for the time and contented herself with treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) coldly, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) decided inwardly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down and set her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) proper place, for goodness only knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was fancying herself.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, except the Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned up, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. '' As a favour! Fancy that! '' The older and more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away.
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna had the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna, Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was the most generous, noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had been a friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) first husband's, and a guest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) father's house, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had promised to use all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) influence to secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) a considerable pension.
<p/>It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna exalted anyone's connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior motive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to the consequence of the person praised.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was only asked out of kindness and because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), so that it would have been awkward not to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<p/>Probably <div class="bookquote">``taking his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) cue''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>from Luzhin, <div class="bookquote">``that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up either. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) fancy himself? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div><p/>Among those who failed to appear were <div class="bookquote">``the genteel lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) old-maidish daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>lodgers</b></font>)</div>who had only been lodgers in the house for the last fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar in Katerina Ivanovna's room, especially when Marmeladov had come back drunk.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who, quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole family out of doors, had shouted at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) that they <div class="bookquote">``were not worth the foot''  (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div>of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) daughter, <div class="bookquote">``whose foot she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was not worth,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>and who had turned away haughtily when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) casually met them, so that they might know that <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was more noble in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and might see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was not accustomed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) way of living.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had proposed to make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) late father's governorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly stupid of them to turn away on meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>The fat colonel-major -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was really a discharged officer of low rank-RRB- was also absent, but it appeared that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been <div class="bookquote">``not himself''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for the last two days.
<p/>The party consisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt abominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the post office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone at Amalia Ivanovna's.
<p/>A retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy--was without a waistcoat!
<p/>Finally one person having no suit appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The Pole brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna's and whom no one had seen here before.
<p/>One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without even greeting Katerina Ivanovna. All this irritated Katerina Ivanovna intensely.
<p/>To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid for at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a big girl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like well-bred children's.
<p/>'' For whom had they made all these preparations then?'' Katerina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) guests with increased dignity, and even haughtiness.
<p/>Rushing to the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who were absent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) began treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) with extreme nonchalance, which the latter promptly observed and resented.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) stared at some of them with special severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats. Such a beginning was no good omen for the end.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), in the first place, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was the one <div class="bookquote">``educated visitor, and, as everyone knew, was in two years to take a professorship in the university,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and secondly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) immediately and respectfully apologised for having been unable to be at the funeral.
<p/>All were seated at last. Raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the cemetery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) positively pounced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sit on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) left hand -LRB-Amalia Ivanovna was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) right-RRB-.
<p/>In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round correctly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonising cough which interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) every minute and seemed to have grown worse during the last few days, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hastened to pour out in a half whisper to Raskolnikov all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) suppressed feelings and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) just indignation at the failure of the dinner, interspersing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) remarks with lively and uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) visitors and especially of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) landlady.
<p/>'' It's all that cuckoo's fault! You know whom I mean? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)! '' Katerina Ivanovna nodded towards the landlady. ''
<p/>Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s making round eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) feels that we are talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) and can't understand. Pfoo, the owl!
<p/>Have you noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) wants everyone to consider that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is patronising me and doing me an honour by being here?
<p/>I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) like a sensible woman to invite people, especially those who knew my late husband, and look at the set of fools she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has brought!
<p/>Ha-ha! -LRB-Cough-cough-cough.-RRB- And what does she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) put on that cap for? -LRB-Cough-cough-cough.-RRB- The sweeps! Look at that one with the spotty face.
<p/>And those wretched Poles, ha-ha-ha! -LRB-Cough-cough-cough.-RRB- Not one of them has ever poked his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) nose in here, I've never set eyes on them.
<p/>What have they come here for, I ask you? There they sit in a row. Hey, pan ! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cried suddenly to one of them, ``have you tasted the pancakes?
<p/>Take some more! Have some beer! Won't you have some vodka? Look, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s jumped up and is making his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bows, they must be quite starved, poor things.
<p/>Never mind, let them eat! They don't make a noise, anyway, though I'm really afraid for our landlady's silver spoons... Amalia Ivanovna!
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) suddenly, almost aloud, <div class="bookquote">``if your spoons should happen to be stolen, I won't be responsible, I warn you!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Ha-ha-ha! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) laughed turning to Raskolnikov, and again nodding towards the landlady, in high glee at her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) sally. ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) didn't understand, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) didn't understand again! Look how she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) sits with her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) mouth open! An owl, a real owl! An owl in new ribbons, ha-ha-ha!''
<p/>Here her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that lasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration stood out on her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) forehead and her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) handkerchief was stained with blood.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) showed Raskolnikov the blood in silence, and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) could get her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) breath began whispering to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) cheeks.
<p/>'' Do you know, I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) the most delicate instructions, so to speak, for inviting that lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) daughter
<p/>It needed the utmost delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) has managed things so that that fool, that conceited baggage, that provincial nonentity, simply because she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) is the widow of a major, and has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) skirts in the government offices, because at fifty she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) paints her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) face -LRB-everybody knows it-RRB-...
<p/>a creature like that did not think fit to come, and has not even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good manners required!
<p/>, you understand of whom I am speaking? I can't understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But where's Sonia? Where has she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) gone?
<p/>Ah, there she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is at last! what is it, Sonia, where have you been? It's odd that even at your father's funeral you should be so unpunctual.
<p/>Rodion Romanovitch, make room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) beside you. That's your place, Sonia... take what you like. Have some of the cold entrée with jelly, that's the best.
<p/>They'll bring the pancakes directly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you got everything? -LRB-Cough-cough-cough.-RRB- That's all right. Be a good girl, Lida, and, Kolya, don't fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman.
<p/>Sonia hastened to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) Pyotr Petrovitch's apologies, trying to speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most respectful phrases which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) added that Pyotr Petrovitch had particularly told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) to say that, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) possibly could, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would come immediately to discuss business alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and to consider what could be done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), etc., etc..
<p/>What are you saying, Sonia?'' Sonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, would flatter her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and gratify her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) pride. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) sat down beside Raskolnikov; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) a hurried bow, glancing curiously at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>But for the rest of the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) seemed to avoid looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) or speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) seemed absent-minded, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, trying to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>Neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get mourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna had on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) only dress, a dark striped cotton one.
<p/>Listening to Sonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how Pyotr Petrovitch was, then at once whispered almost aloud to Raskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of Pyotr Petrovitch's position and standing to find himself in such <div class="bookquote">``extraordinary company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) devotion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) family and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old friendship with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) father.
<p/>That's why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, that you have not disdained my hospitality, even in such surroundings,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) added almost aloud.
<p/>But I am sure that it was only your special affection for my poor husband that has made you keep your promise.
<p/>Then once more with pride and dignity she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) scanned her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) visitors, and suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man:
<p/>The message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have some more meat, and had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been given some wine?
<p/>The old man made no answer and for a long while could not understand what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was asked, though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) simply gazed about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth open, which only increased the general mirth. '' What an imbecile! Look, look!
<p/>But as to Pyotr Petrovitch, I always had confidence in him (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>),'' Katerina Ivanovna continued, <div class="bookquote">``and, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) is not like...''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>with an extremely stern face she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter was quite disconcerted, <div class="bookquote">``not like your dressed up draggletails whom my father would not have taken as cooks into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kitchen, and my late husband would have done them honour if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had invited them in the goodness of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amalia Ivanovna</b></font>)</div><p/>Why was he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brought? <div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was fond of drink, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was fond of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did drink! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the commissariat clerk</b></font>)</div>cried the commissariat clerk, gulping down his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) twelfth glass of vodka.
<p/>My late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows it,'' Katerina Ivanovna attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at once, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a kind and honourable man, who loved and respected his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) family.
<p/>The worst of it was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) good nature made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) drank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoe.
<p/>Would you believe it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread cock in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pocket; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was dead drunk, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not forget the children!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``A cock? Did you say a cock?''  (<font color='red'><b>the commissariat clerk</b></font>)</div>shouted the commissariat clerk. Katerina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sighed, lost in thought.
<p/>'' No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too severe with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) went on, addressing Raskolnikov. '' But that's not so!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) respected me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) respected me very much! He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sometimes!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would sit in a corner and look at me, I used to feel so sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), I used to want to be kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and then would think to myself: `Be kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) will drink again,' it was only by severity that you could keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) within bounds.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) used to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hair pulled pretty often,''  (<font color='red'><b>the commissariat clerk</b></font>)</div>roared the commissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of vodka. ''
<p/>Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as well as having their hair pulled. I am not talking of my late husband now!''
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna snapped at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). The flush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cheeks grew more and more marked, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) chest heaved. In another minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would have been ready to make a scene.
<p/>Many of the visitors were sniggering, evidently delighted. They began poking the commissariat clerk and whispering something to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). They were evidently trying to egg him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me to ask what are you alluding to,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>began the clerk, <div class="bookquote">``that is to say, whose... about whom... did you say just now...
<p/>But I don't care! That's nonsense! Widow! I forgive you.... Pass!''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took another drink of vodka. Raskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) only ate from politeness, just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) plate, to avoid hurting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) feelings.
<p/>But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), too, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with terror Katerina Ivanovna's growing irritation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) watched Sonia intently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), Sonia, was the chief reason for the `genteel' ladies' contemptuous treatment of Katerina Ivanovna's invitation.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that the mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the question: <div class="bookquote">``How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) daughter sit down beside that young person ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard this and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an insult to herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) children, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) father, Sonia knew that Katerina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now, <div class="bookquote">``till she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had shown those draggletails that they were both...''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>To make matters worse someone passed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna flushed crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it was <div class="bookquote">``a drunken ass!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Amalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same time deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna's haughtiness, and to restore the good-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) began, apropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Karl from the chemist's,''  (<font color='red'><b>an acquaintance Karl</b></font>)</div>who was driving one night in a cab, and that <div class="bookquote">``the cabman wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) to kill, and Karl very much begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) not to kill, and wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) observed at once that Amalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was still more offended, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) retorted that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) ''  (<font color='red'><b>an acquaintance Karl</b></font>)</div>Vater aus Berlin was a very important man, and always went with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands in pockets.
<p/>'' '' Katerina Ivanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia Ivanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) good-humour almost restored, ``she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) meant to say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands in people's pockets.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to the owl!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Cough-cough.-RRB- And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all these Petersburg foreigners, the Germans especially, are all stupider than we!
<p/>Can you fancy anyone of us telling how `Karl from the chemist's' `pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) heart from fear' and that the idiot, instead of punishing the cabman, `clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) hands and wept, and much begged.'
<p/>To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal cleverer, anyway one can see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) has addled his (<font color='blue'><b>Karl</b></font>) brains with drink, but you know, these foreigners are always so well behaved and serious....
<p/>Ah, the fool! And you know she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) fancies it's very touching and does not suspect how stupid she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) is! Look how she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) sits glaring!
<p/>Regaining her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling Raskolnikov that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had obtained her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pension, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) intended to open a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) native town T--.
<p/>This was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) of the project, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) launched out into the most alluring details.
<p/>It suddenly appeared that Katerina Ivanovna had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hands the very certificate of honour of which Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) that Katerina Ivanovna, his (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) wife, had danced the shawl dance before the governor and other great personages on leaving school.
<p/>This certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina Ivanovna's right to open a boarding-school; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had armed herself with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming <div class="bookquote">``those two stuck-up draggletails''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably that Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) might even say aristocratic family, a colonel's daughter and was far superior to certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late.
<p/>The certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually contained the statement en toutes lettres , that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) father was of the rank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) really was almost the daughter of a colonel.
<p/>Warming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and happy life they would lead in T--, on the gymnasium teachers whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would engage to give lessons in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) boarding-school, one a most respectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna herself in old days and was still living in T--, and would no doubt teach in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) school on moderate terms.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is angry, ha-ha! -LRB-Cough-cough-cough.-RRB- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>'' Next she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) spoke of Sonia who would go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) to T-- and help her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) plans.
<p/>Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) voice and began at once speaking with conviction of Sonia's undoubted ability to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), of <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) gentleness, patience, devotion, generosity and good education,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>tapping Sonia on the cheek and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) warmly twice.
<p/>Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was ``nervous and silly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and as the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea.
<p/>At that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in the conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort, and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty observation, that ``in the future boarding-school she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would have to pay particular attention to die Wäsche , and that there certainly must be a good dame to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies must not novels at night read.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well as heartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying ``she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the business of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class boarding-school to look after die Wäsche , and as for novel-reading, that was simply rudeness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) to be silent.
<p/>Amalia Ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) only <div class="bookquote">``meant her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) good,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and that <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had meant her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and that ``it was long since she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) gold for the lodgings.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna at once <div class="bookquote">``set her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>saying that it was a lie to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) good, because only yesterday when her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) dead husband was lying on the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had worried her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) about the lodgings.
<p/>To this Amalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had invited those ladies, but <div class="bookquote">``those ladies had not come, because those ladies are ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna at once pointed out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was a slut she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) could not judge what made one really a lady.
<p/>Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) ''  (<font color='red'><b>those ladies</b></font>)</div>Vater aus Berlin was a very, very important man, and both hands in pockets went, and always used to say: `Poof!
<p/>At this someone at the further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw. '' '' '' '' '' poof!' ''
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) leapt up from the table to represent her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) father, sticking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pockets, puffing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling ``poof!
<p/>But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) at once declared, so that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a father, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once been a cook and probably something worse.
<p/>Amalia Ivanovna turned as red as a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a father, <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had a Vater aus Berlin and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wore a long coat and always said poof-poof-poof!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a father</b></font>)</div><p/>Katerina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) family was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna's father--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) really had one--was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) never had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) name was Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.
<p/>At this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) fist, and shrieked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, ``that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) Vater was named Johann and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Johann</b></font>) was a burgomeister, and that Katerina Ivanovna's Vater was quite never a burgomeister.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice -LRB-though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was pale and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) chest was heaving-RRB- observed that <div class="bookquote">``if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) dared for one moment to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) papa, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cap off her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) head and trample it under foot.
<p/>Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room, shouting at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) voice, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was mistress of the house and that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.
<p/>poof! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>amid loud laughter from all the lodgers, who purposely encouraged Amalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight. '' '' There was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying.
<p/>Sonia ran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted something about <div class="bookquote">``the yellow ticket,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amalia Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia away, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) threat.
<p/>At that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared on the threshold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant eyes.
<p/>Make this foolish woman understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can't behave like this to a lady in misfortune... that there is a law for such things....
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). CHAPTER III <div class="bookquote">``Pyotr Petrovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``protect me... you at least!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) shall answer for it.... Remembering my father's hospitality protect these orphans.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Allow me, madam.... Allow me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>Pyotr Petrovitch waved her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) off.
<p/>'' Your papa as you are well aware I had not the honour of knowing'' -LRB-someone laughed aloud-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``and I do not intend to take part in your everlasting squabbles with Amalia Ivanovna....
<p/>I have come here to speak of my own affairs... and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya... Ivanovna, I think it is?
<p/>Allow me to pass. ''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>Pyotr Petrovitch, edging by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), went to the opposite corner where Sonia was. Katerina Ivanovna remained standing where she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was, as though thunderstruck.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny having enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) father's hospitality. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had invented it herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) believed in it firmly by this time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was struck too by the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr Petrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entrance.
<p/>Not only was this <div class="bookquote">``serious business man''  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>strikingly incongruous with the rest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come upon some matter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and that therefore something was going to happen.
<p/>A minute later Lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in the doorway; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) did not come in, but stood still, listening with marked interest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed.
<p/>Raskolnikov, standing beside Sonia, moved aside to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not seem to notice him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it's a matter of some importance,'' Pyotr Petrovitch observed, addressing the company generally.
<p/>Amalia Ivanovna, I humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful attention to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna.
<p/>Sofya Ivanovna,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went on, addressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already alarmed, <div class="bookquote">``immediately after your visit I found that a hundred-rouble note was missing from my table, in the room of my friend Mr. Lebeziatnikov.
<p/>If in any way whatever you know and will tell us where it is now, I assure you on my word of honour and call all present to witness that the matter shall end there.
<p/>In the opposite case I shall be compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then... you must blame yourself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>I am glad indeed to find other persons present. '' Complete silence reigned in the room. Even the crying children were still.
<p/>Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to say a word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) seemed not to understand. Some seconds passed.
<p/>'' Well, how is it to be then? '' asked Luzhin, looking intently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). '' I don't know.... I know nothing about it,'' Sonia articulated faintly at last.
<p/>'' No, you know nothing? '' Luzhin repeated and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) paused for some seconds. <div class="bookquote">``Think a moment, mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) began severely, but still, as it were, admonishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely convinced I should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture to accuse you so directly.
<p/>Seeing that for such direct accusation before witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain sense be made responsible, I am aware of that.
<p/>'' Reflect, I am prepared to give you time for consideration. This morning I changed for my own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of approximately three thousand roubles.
<p/>On my return home I proceeded to count the money--as Mr. Lebeziatnikov will bear witness--and after counting two thousand three hundred roubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket.
<p/>The account is noted down in my pocket-book. About five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three notes of a hundred roubles each.
<p/>At that moment you entered -LRB-at my invitation-RRB---and all the time you were present you were exceedingly embarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the conversation and tried to make off.
<p/>You yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm my statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely in order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your relative, Katerina Ivanovna -LRB-whose dinner I was unable to attend-RRB-, and the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a subscription, lottery or the like, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) benefit.
<p/>I describe all this as it took place, primarily to recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest detail has escaped my recollection.
<p/>Then I took a ten-rouble note from the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part for the benefit of your relative.
<p/>Then I accompanied you to the door--you being still in the same state of embarrassment--after which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) for ten minutes
<p/>--then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I returned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to count it and to put it aside, as I proposed doing before.
<p/>Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness to this. You thanked me and even shed tears. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this. To my surprise one hundred-rouble note had disappeared.
<p/>Kindly consider the position. Mr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such a supposition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for the minute before your entrance
<p/>You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, your eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some time on the table, and taking into consideration your social position and the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and positively against my will, compelled to entertain a suspicion--a cruel, but justifiable suspicion!
<p/>I will add further and repeat that in spite of my positive conviction, I realise that I run a certain risk in making this accusation, but as you see, I could not let it pass.
<p/>I had finished my accounts and found the total correct. I have taken action and I will tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing to your black ingratitude!
<p/>I invite you for the benefit of your destitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and you, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action.
<p/>Moreover, like a true friend I beg you--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what you are doing, otherwise I shall be immovable!
<p/>Why! It is too bad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Well, what do you say?'' <div class="bookquote">``I have taken nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>Sonia whispered in terror, <div class="bookquote">``you gave me ten roubles, here it is, take it.
<p/>Sonia pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) handkerchief out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) pocket, untied a corner of it, took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>'' And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) insisted reproachfully, not taking the note. Sonia looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>All were looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) with such awful, stern, ironical, hostile eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked at Raskolnikov... he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood against the wall, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) arms crossed, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) with glowing eyes.
<p/>Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the police and therefore I humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter,
<p/>'' Good God!'' broke from Sonia. '' '' Luzhin said softly and even kindly. '' Gott der Barmherzige ! I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was the thief,'' cried Amalia Ivanovna, throwing up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hands.
<p/>'' You knew it?'' Luzhin caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) up, <div class="bookquote">``then I suppose you had some reason before this for thinking so. I beg you, worthy Amalia Ivanovna, to remember your words which have been uttered before witnesses.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div>There was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All were in movement. <div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) rushed at Luzhin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! You accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) of stealing? Sonia? Ah, the wretches, the wretches!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>And running to Sonia she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) wasted arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) as in a vise.
<p/>'' Sonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>)? Foolish girl! Give it to me! Give me the ten roubles at once--here!''
<p/>And snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and flung it straight into Luzhin's face. It hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) in the eye and fell on the ground.
<p/>Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) temper. '' Hold that mad woman!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Luzhin</b></font>) shouted. At that moment several other persons, besides Lebeziatnikov, appeared in the doorway, among them the two ladies.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Mad? Am I mad? Idiot! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>shrieked Katerina Ivanovna. '' You are an idiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base man! Sonia, Sonia take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money!
<p/>Sonia a thief! Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)'d give away her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) last penny!'' and Katerina Ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter. '' Did you ever see such an idiot?
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) suddenly saw the landlady, <div class="bookquote">``and you too, sausage eater, you declare that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is a thief, you trashy Prussian hen's leg in a crinoline!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hasn't been out of this room: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) came straight from you, you wretch, and sat down beside me, everyone saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) turned from side to side. '' And you too? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)! Since she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s not left the room, the money would have to be on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)!
<p/>I'll go to our Sovereign, to our Sovereign, to our gracious Tsar himself, and throw myself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tsar</b></font>) feet, to-day, this minute!
<p/>Search her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), search her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)! But if you don't find it, then excuse me, my dear fellow, you'll answer for it! I am alone in the world!
<p/>They would let me in! Do you think they wouldn't? You're wrong, I will get in! I will get in! You reckoned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) meekness!
<p/>You relied upon that! But I am not so submissive, let me tell you! You've gone too far yourself. Search her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), search her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)!''
<p/>And Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) towards Sonia. '' I am ready, I'll be responsible... but calm yourself, madam, calm yourself.
<p/>Well, well, but as to that...'' Luzhin muttered, <div class="bookquote">``that ought to be before the police... though indeed there are witnesses enough as it is....
<p/>I see that you are not so submissive!... I am ready.... But in any case it's difficult for a man... on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) sex....
<p/>But with the help of Amalia Ivanovna... though, of course, it's not the way to do things.... How is it to be done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div><p/>'' As you will! Let anyone who likes search her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)!'' cried Katerina Ivanovna. '' Sonia, turn out your pockets! See! Look, monster, the pocket is empty, here was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) handkerchief!
<p/>But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing a parabola in the air fell at Luzhin's feet.
<p/>Here is the other pocket, look! D'you see, d'you see?'' And Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched-- both pockets inside out. Everyone saw it, several cried out.
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two fingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it.
<p/>It was a hundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note showing it to everyone. '' Thief! Out of my lodging.
<p/>Police, police!'' yelled Amalia Ivanovna. '' They must to Siberia be sent! Away!'' Exclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.
<p/>Sonia stood still, as though unconscious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was hardly able to feel surprise. Suddenly the colour rushed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cheeks; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) uttered a cry and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands.
<p/>I know nothing about it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cried with a heartrending wail, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) tightly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) arms, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would shelter her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) from all the world.
<p/>'' No, it wasn't I! I didn't take it! '' Sonia! Sonia! I don't believe it! You see, I don't believe it!
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) to and fro in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) arms like a baby, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face continually, then snatching at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands and kissing them, too, <div class="bookquote">``you took it!
<p/>You are fools, fools,''  (<font color='red'><b>a baby</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cried, addressing the whole room, <div class="bookquote">``you don't know, you don't know what a heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has, what a girl she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is!

<p/>Do you believe it, too? You are not worth her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) little finger, all of you together! Good God! Defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) now, at least!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The agonised, wasted, consumptive face, the parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained as a child's, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>The wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a great effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) audience. Pyotr Petrovitch at any rate was at once moved to compassion .
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried impressively, <div class="bookquote">``no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an instigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) guilt by turning out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pockets, showing that you had no previous idea of it.
<p/>I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty, so to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to confess, mademoiselle?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you! Were you afraid of the disgrace? The first step? You lost your head, perhaps?
<p/>One can quite understand it.... But how could you have lowered yourself to such an action? Gentlemen,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) addressed the whole company, <div class="bookquote">``gentlemen!
<p/>Compassionate and, so to say, commiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even now in spite of the personal insult lavished upon me!
<p/>And may this disgrace be a lesson to you for the future,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) said, addressing Sonia, <div class="bookquote">``and I will carry the matter no further.
<p/>Enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>Pyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes met, and the fire in Raskolnikov's seemed ready to reduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to ashes.
<p/>The children, too, were embracing Sonia on all sides, and Polenka--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) did not fully understand what was wrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) pretty little face, swollen with weeping, on Sonia's shoulder.
<p/>Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was kissing and hugging Sonia like a madwoman. '' How vile! '' a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly. '' What vileness! '' Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) straight in the face. Pyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start--all noticed it and recalled it afterwards.
<p/>Lebeziatnikov strode into the room. '' And you dared to call me as witness? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) said, going up to Pyotr Petrovitch.
<p/>'' What do you mean? What are you talking about? '' muttered Luzhin. '' I mean that you... are a slanderer, that's what my words mean!
<p/>'' Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) short-sighted eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), as though seizing and weighing each word.
<p/>Again there was a silence. Pyotr Petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment. '' If you mean that for me,...'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began, stammering.
<p/>'' But what's the matter with you? Are you out of your mind?'' <div class="bookquote">``I'm in my mind, but you are a scoundrel!
<p/>Ah, how vile! I have heard everything. I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must own even now
<p/>it is not quite logical.... What you have done it all for I can't understand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, what have I done then?
<p/>Give over talking in your nonsensical riddles! Or maybe you are drunk!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not!
<p/>I never touch vodka, for it's against my convictions. Would you believe it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own hands gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble note--
<p/>I saw it, I was a witness, I'll take my oath! He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) did it, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>repeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all. '' Are you crazy, milksop?'' squealed Luzhin.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is herself before you--she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) herself here declared just now before everyone that I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) only ten roubles. How could I have given it to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw it, I saw it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>Lebeziatnikov repeated, <div class="bookquote">``and though it is against my principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like before the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>When you were saying good-bye to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) at the door, while you held her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hand in one hand, with the other, the left, you slipped the note into her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>Only like a fool I thought you did it out of kindness! I saw it, I saw it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>Luzhin turned pale.
<p/>'' What lies! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) cried impudently, <div class="bookquote">``why, how could you, standing by the window, see the note? You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes.
<p/>You are raving!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' No, I didn't fancy it. And though I was standing some way off, I saw it all.
<p/>And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from the window--that's true--I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble note, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles, you took up from the table a hundred-rouble note -LRB-I saw it because I was standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did not forget you had it in your hand-RRB-.
<p/>I didn't think of it again until, when you were getting up, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped it!
<p/>I noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you meant to do her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) a kindness without my seeing.
<p/>You folded it and kept it in your hand all the time. You can fancy how I watched you and I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>I saw it, I saw it, I'll take my oath. '' Lebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose on all hands chiefly expressive of wonder, but some were menacing in tone.
<p/>They all crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov. '' I was mistaken in you! Protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)! You are the only one to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) part!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is an orphan. God has sent you!'' Katerina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was doing, sank on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) knees before him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>'' A pack of nonsense! '' yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, <div class="bookquote">``it's all nonsense you've been talking! ' An idea struck you, you didn't think, you noticed'--what does it amount to?
<p/>So I gave it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) on the sly on purpose? What for? With what object? What have I to do with this...?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Petrovitch/Luzhin/Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin</b></font>)</div><p/>So far from my being mistaken, you infamous criminal man, I remember how, on account of it, a question occurred to me at once, just when I was thanking you and pressing your hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What for? That's what I can't understand, but that what I am telling you is the fact, that's certain! What made you put it secretly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pocket?
<p/>Could it be simply to conceal it from me, knowing that my convictions are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of private benevolence, which effects no radical cure?
<p/>Why you did it secretly , I mean? Well, I decided that you really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me.
<p/>Perhaps, too, I thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wants to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) a surprise, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) finds a whole hundred-rouble note in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>Then the idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), to see whether, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) found it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would come to thank you.
<p/>Then, too, that you wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right hand should not know... something of that sort, in fact.
<p/>I thought of so many possibilities that I put off considering it, but still thought it indelicate to show you that I knew your secret.
<p/>But another idea struck me again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) noticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) out of the room and to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) that you put a hundred roubles in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>But on my way I went first to Madame Kobilatnikov's to take them the `General Treatise on the Positive Method' and especially to recommend Piderit's article -LRB-and also
<p/>-LRB-For I know, some benevolent people are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.-RRB- Wagner's-RRB-; then I come on here and what a state of things I find!
<p/>Now could I, could I, have all these ideas and reflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pocket?
<p/>When Lebeziatnikov finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) long-winded harangue with the logical deduction at the end, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) was quite tired, and the perspiration streamed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) could not, alas, even express himself correctly in Russian, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) knew no other language, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) was quite exhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) speech produced a powerful effect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) had spoken with such vehemence, with such conviction that everyone obviously believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>).
<p/>Pyotr Petrovitch felt that things were going badly with him (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>). '' What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) shouted, <div class="bookquote">``that's no evidence. You may have dreamt it, that's all! And I tell you, you are lying, sir.
<p/>You are lying and slandering from some spite against me, simply from pique, because I did not agree with your free-thinking, godless, social propositions!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch. Murmurs of disapproval were heard on all sides. '' Ah, that's your line now, is it!
<p/>'' cried Lebeziatnikov, ``that's nonsense! Call the police and I'll take my oath! There's only one thing I can't understand: what made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) risk such a contemptible action.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can explain why he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) risked such an action, and if necessary, I, too, will swear to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stepped forward.
<p/>Everyone felt clearly, from the very look of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) really knew about it and that the mystery would be solved.
<p/>Oh, pitiful, despicable man!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared to be firm and composed. '' Now I can explain it all to myself,'' said Raskolnikov, addressing Lebeziatnikov.
<p/>'' From the very beginning of the business, I suspected that there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it.
<p/>I began to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, which I will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything.
<p/>Your valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I beg all, all to listen. This gentleman -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pointed to Luzhin-RRB- was recently engaged to be married to a young lady--my sister, Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikov.
<p/>But coming to Petersburg he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) quarrelled with me, the day before yesterday, at our first meeting and I drove him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) out of my room--I have two witnesses to prove it.
<p/>The day before yesterday I did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was staying here, in your room, and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before yesterday--he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral, as a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marmeladov</b></font>) at once wrote a note to my mother and informed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that I had given away all my money, not to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most contemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is, hinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna.
<p/>All this you understand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister, by insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the money which they had sent me and which was all they had.
<p/>Yesterday evening, before my mother and sister and in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) presence, I declared that I had given the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) before, indeed.
<p/>At the same time I added that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) virtues, was not worth Sofya Semyonovna's little finger, though he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) spoke so ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) question--would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I answered that I had already done so that day.
<p/>Irritated that my mother and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) insinuations, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) gradually began being unpardonably rude to them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is a very spiteful man.... A final rupture took place and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was turned out of the house. All this happened yesterday evening.
<p/>Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had now succeeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) would have shown to my mother and sister that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was almost right in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) suspicions, that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on a level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was protecting and preserving the honour of my sister, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) betrothed.
<p/>In fact he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) might even, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family, and no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing of revenging himself on me personally, for he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has grounds for supposing that the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to me.
<p/>That was what he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was working for! That's how I understand it. That's the whole reason for it and there can be no other!
<p/>It was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov wound up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) speech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted by exclamations from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) audience.
<p/>'' But in spite of interruptions he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) spoke clearly, calmly, exactly, firmly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) decisive voice, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tone of conviction and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stern face made a great impression on everyone.
<p/>Yes, yes, that's it,'' Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, <div class="bookquote">``that must be it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room, whether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna's guests.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) called me aside to the window and asked me in secret. It was essential for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) that you should be here!
<p/>That's it, that's it!'' Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) was very pale. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) would have been glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this was scarcely possible.
<p/>It would have implied admitting the truth of the accusations brought against him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>). Moreover, the company, which had already been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it.
<p/>The commissariat clerk, though indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) had not grasped the whole position, was shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very unpleasant to Luzhin.
<p/>The three Poles were tremendously excited and were continually shouting at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``The pan is a lajdak !''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and muttering threats in Polish.
<p/>Sonia had been listening with strained attention, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) too seemed unable to grasp it all; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) seemed as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had just returned to consciousness.
<p/>But not all those present were drunk; lodgers came in from all the rooms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) did not take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) safety lay in him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted. Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mouth wide open, unable to make out what had happened.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) only saw that Pyotr Petrovitch had somehow come to grief. Raskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Everyone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse. But Pyotr Petrovitch was not intimidated. Seeing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) accusation of Sonia had completely failed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had recourse to insolence: <div class="bookquote">``Allow me, gentlemen, allow me!
<p/>Don't squeeze, let me pass! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) way through the crowd. '' And no threats, if you please!
<p/>I assure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it. On the contrary, you'll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing the course of justice.
<p/>Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, and will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and atheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are foolish enough to admit....
<p/>The thief has been more than unmasked, and I shall prosecute. Yes, allow me to pass!'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't let me find a trace of you in my room!
<p/>Kindly leave at once, and everything is at an end between us! When I think of the trouble I've been taking, the way I've been expounding... all this fortnight!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried to keep me; now I will simply add that you are a fool.
<p/>I advise you to see a doctor for your brains and your short sight. Let me pass, gentlemen!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) forced his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) way through.
<p/>But the commissariat clerk was unwilling to let him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) off so easily: he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) picked up a glass from the table, brandished it in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flew straight at Amalia Ivanovna.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing, fell heavily under the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) way to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) room and half an hour later had left the house.
<p/>Sonia, timid by nature, had felt before that day that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could be ill-treated more easily than anyone, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could be wronged with impunity.
<p/>Yet till that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) might escape misfortune by care, gentleness and submissiveness before everyone. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) disappointment was too great.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could, of course, bear with patience and almost without murmur anything, even this. But for the first minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) felt it too bitter.
<p/>In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) triumph and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) justification--when her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) first terror and stupefaction had passed and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could understand it all clearly--the feeling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) helplessness and of the wrong done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)
<p/>At last, unable to bear any more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) rushed out of the room and ran home, almost immediately after Luzhin's departure.
<p/>made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) heart throb with anguish and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was overcome with hysterical weeping. When amidst loud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the landlady could endure.
<p/>With a shriek she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) rushed like a fury at Katerina Ivanovna, considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) to blame for everything. '' Out of my lodgings!
<p/>And with these words she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) began snatching up everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) could lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on the floor.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath, jumped up from the bed where she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had sunk in exhaustion and darted at Amalia Ivanovna.
<p/>At once! Quick march! '' But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) away like a feather. <div class="bookquote">``What! As though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creature attacks me!
<p/>What! On the day of my husband's funeral I am turned out of my lodging! After eating my bread and salt she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) turns me into the street, with my orphans!
<p/>Where am I to go? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>wailed the poor woman, sobbing and gasping. '' Good God! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried with flashing eyes, <div class="bookquote">``is there no justice upon earth?
<p/>Whom should you protect if not us orphans? We shall see! There is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it!
<p/>Wait a bit, godless creature! Polenka, stay with the children, I'll come back. Wait for me, if you have to wait in the street.
<p/>And throwing over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head that green shawl which Marmeladov had mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) way through the disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and, wailing and tearful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) ran into the street--with a vague intention of going at once somewhere to find justice.
<p/>Polenka with the two little ones in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) waited trembling for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mother to come back.
<p/>We will see whether there is justice on earth!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Amalia Ivanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) came across on the floor.
<p/>The lodgers talked incoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what had happened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while others struck up a song...
<p/>'' Now it's time for me to go,'' thought Raskolnikov. '' Well, Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you'll say now!
<p/>CHAPTER IV Raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against Luzhin, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had such a load of horror and anguish in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own heart.
<p/>But having gone through so much in the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) found a sort of relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal feeling which impelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to defend Sonia.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was agitated too, especially at some moments, by the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) approaching interview with Sonia: he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) who had killed Lizaveta.
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) set off in the direction of Sonia's lodgings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knew the terrible suffering it would be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and, as it were, brushed away the thought of it.
<p/>So when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cried as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) left Katerina Ivanovna's, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you'll say now! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was still superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) triumph over Luzhin.
<p/>But, strange to say, by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) reached Sonia's lodging, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt a sudden impotence and fear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood still in hesitation at the door, asking himself the strange question: <div class="bookquote">``Must he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) who killed Lizaveta?
<p/>It was a strange question because he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt at the very time not only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not help telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), but also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not put off the telling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not yet know why it must be so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) only felt it, and the agonising sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) impotence before the inevitable almost crushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) elbows on the table and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) got up at once and came to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) were expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>To cut short his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hesitation and suffering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the doorway. ''
<p/>What would have become of me but for you? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) said quickly, meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in the middle of the room.
<p/>Evidently she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was in haste to say this to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). It was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had been waiting for. Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had only just risen.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, and felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) voice was trembling, <div class="bookquote">``it was all due to `your social position and the habits associated with it.'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) stood facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), two steps away, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had done the day before. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Well, Sonia? '' Did you understand that just now?
<p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) distress. '' Only don't talk to me as you did yesterday,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' Please don't begin it.
<p/>There is misery enough without that. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) made haste to smile, afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) might not like the reproach. ''
<p/>I was silly to come away from there. What is happening there now? I wanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking that... you would come.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere <div class="bookquote">``to seek justice.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``My God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>cried Sonia, <div class="bookquote">``let's go at once... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) snatched up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cape. '' It's everlastingly the same thing!'' said Raskolnikov, irritably.
<p/>'' You've no thought except for them! Stay a little with me.'' '' But... Katerina Ivanovna?'' <div class="bookquote">``You won't lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'ll come to you herself since she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has run out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added peevishly. '' If she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) doesn't find you here, you'll be blamed for it....
<p/>This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began, not looking at Sonia, <div class="bookquote">``but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had wanted to, if it had suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) plans, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would have sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>Sonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was silent, gazing at the floor and deliberating. '' Ah?'' '' Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) assented in a faint voice.
<p/>'' Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) repeated, preoccupied and distressed. '' But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite an accident
<p/>Lebeziatnikov's turning up. '' Sonia was silent. '' And if you'd gone to prison, what then? Do you remember what I said yesterday?
<p/>'' Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) did not answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) waited. '' I thought you would cry out again `don't speak of it, leave off.'
<p/>'' Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. '' What, silence again? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked a minute later. ''
<p/>We must talk about something, you know. It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a certain `problem' as Lebeziatnikov would say.
<p/>'' -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) was beginning to lose the thread.-RRB- '' No, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you had known all Luzhin's intentions beforehand.
<p/>Known, that is, for a fact, that they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children and yourself thrown in--since you don't count yourself for anything--
<p/>Well, if suddenly it all depended on your decision whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) or they should go on living, that is whether Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or Katerina Ivanovna should die?
<p/>Polenka too... for she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'ll go the same way. How would you decide which of them was to die? I ask you?''
<p/>Sonia looked uneasily at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>). There was something peculiar in this hesitating question, which seemed approaching something in a roundabout way.
<p/>'' I felt that you were going to ask some question like that,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) said, looking inquisitively at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>). '' I dare say you did.
<p/>But how is it to be answered?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why do you ask about what could not happen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>said Sonia reluctantly. '' Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked things?
<p/>You haven't dared to decide even that!'' '' But I can't know the Divine Providence.... And why do you ask what can't be answered?
<p/>How could it happen that it should depend on my decision--who has made me a judge to decide who is to live and who is not to live?''
<p/>What's the use of such foolish questions? '' Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no doing anything,'' Raskolnikov grumbled morosely.
<p/>'' You'd better say straight out what you want!'' Sonia cried in distress. '' You are leading up to something again....
<p/>Can you have come simply to torture me? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could not control herself and began crying bitterly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) in gloomy misery.
<p/>Five minutes passed. '' Of course you're right, Sonia,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said softly at last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was suddenly changed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.
<p/>I told you yesterday that I was not coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing I've said is to ask forgiveness....
<p/>Even his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) voice was suddenly weak. '' I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake. I was asking forgiveness, Sonia...
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tried to smile, but there was something helpless and incomplete in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pale smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head and hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands.
<p/>As it were wondering and frightened of this sensation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head and looked intently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)
<p/>And suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred for Sonia passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart. ; there was love in them; his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hatred vanished like a phantom.
<p/>It was not the real feeling; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant that that minute had come.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned pale, got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) chair, looked at Sonia, and without uttering a word sat down mechanically on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) bed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had stood over the old woman with the axe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand and felt that <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) must not lose another minute.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands again and bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>'' What's the matter?'' asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened.
<p/>This was not at all, not at all the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had intended to <div class="bookquote">``tell''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not understand what was happening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) now.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), softly, sat down on the bed beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and waited, not taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not utter a word. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) heart throbbed and sank. It was unendurable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) deadly pale face to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lips worked, helplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror passed through Sonia's heart. '' What's the matter? ''
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) repeated, drawing a little away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' Nothing, Sonia, don't be frightened.... It's nonsense. It really is nonsense, if you think of it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) muttered, like a man in delirium.
<p/>'' Why have I come to torture you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added suddenly, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). '' Why, really? I keep asking myself that question, Sonia...
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour before, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said and feeling a continual tremor all over.
<p/>'' Oh, how you are suffering! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) muttered in distress, looking intently at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' It's all nonsense.... Listen, Sonia.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suddenly smiled, a pale helpless smile for two seconds. '' You remember what I meant to tell you yesterday?''
<p/>I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever, but that if I came to-day I would tell you who... who killed Lizaveta.
<p/>Sonia waited uneasily. '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) began trembling all over. '' Well, here I've come to tell you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then you really meant it yesterday?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) whispered with difficulty. '' How do you know? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) asked quickly, as though suddenly regaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) reason. Sonia's face grew paler and paler, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) breathed painfully.
<p/>'' I know. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) paused a minute. '' Have they found him (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) asked timidly. '' No.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then how do you know about it ?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) asked again, hardly audibly and again after a minute's pause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and looked very intently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>'' Guess,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) said, with the same distorted helpless smile. A shudder passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). '' But you... why do you frighten me like this?
<p/>I must be a great friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ... since I know,'' Raskolnikov went on, still gazing into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes away.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) said, smiling like a child. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)... killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) accidentally....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) meant to kill the old woman when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was alone and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went there... and then Lizaveta came in... he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) too.
<p/>'' Another awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another. '' You can't guess, then? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked suddenly, feeling as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) were flinging himself down from a steeple.
<p/>'' N-no... '' whispered Sonia. '' Take a good look. '' As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta's face, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) with the axe and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) stepped back to the wall, putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hand, with childish terror in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face, looking as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something, looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and holding out their little hands on the point of crying.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and all at once seemed to see in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face the face of Lizaveta. Almost the same thing happened now to Sonia.
<p/>With the same helplessness and the same terror, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) for a while and, suddenly putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) left hand, pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) fingers faintly against his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) breast and slowly began to get up from the bed, moving further from him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes fixed even more immovably on him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) terror infected him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). The same fear showed itself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face. In the same way he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and almost with the same childish smile.
<p/>'' Have you guessed? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) whispered at last. '' Good God! '' broke in an awful wail from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) bosom.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) sank helplessly on the bed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face in the pillows, but a moment later she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) got up, moved quickly to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), seized both his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands and, gripping them tight in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) thin fingers, began looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face again with the same intent stare.
<p/>In this last desperate look she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) tried to look into him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and catch some last hope. But there was no hope; there was no doubt remaining; it was all true!
<p/>Later on, indeed, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) recalled that moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) thought it strange and wondered why she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had seen at once that there was no doubt.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could not have said, for instance, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) suddenly fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had really foreseen this very thing.
<p/>It was not at all, not at all like this he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had thought of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), but this is how it happened.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) jumped up, seeming not to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was doing, and, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat down again beside him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) shoulder almost touching his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) knees before him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) did not know why.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, Sonia, enough! don't torture me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) miserably. All of a sudden she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) started '' What have you done--what have you done to yourself?
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) said in despair, and, jumping up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) flung herself on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) neck, threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and held him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tightly.
<p/>'' Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) with a mournful smile. '' You are a strange girl, Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell you about that....
<p/>You don't think what you are doing. '' '' There is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) suddenly broke into violent hysterical weeping. A feeling long unfamiliar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) flooded his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart and softened it at once.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes and hung on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyelashes. '' Then you won't leave me, Sonia?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) almost with hope. '' No, no, never, nowhere! '' cried Sonia. '' I will follow you, I will follow you everywhere.
<p/>Oh, my God! Oh, how miserable I am!... Why, why didn't I know you before! Why didn't you come before? Oh, dear!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here I have come. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, now! What's to be done now? ... Together, together!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) repeated as it were unconsciously, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) again.
<p/>'' I'll follow you to Siberia!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lips.
<p/>'' Perhaps I don't want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said. Sonia looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) quickly. Again after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) changed tone she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) seemed to hear the murderer speaking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bewildered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been.
<p/>Now all these questions rushed at once into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mind. And again she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could not believe it: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a murderer!
<p/>Could it be true?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' What's the meaning of it? Where am I? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) said in complete bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself.
<p/>'' How could you, you, a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?... What does it mean?'' ''
<p/>Oh, well--to plunder. Leave off, Sonia,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered wearily, almost with vexation. Sonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cried: <div class="bookquote">``You were hungry!
<p/>It was... to help your mother? Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Sonia, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered, turning away and hanging his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. '' I was not so hungry....
<p/>I certainly did want to help my mother, but... that's not the real thing either.... Don't torture me, Sonia. '' Sonia clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands.
<p/>'' Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! Who could believe it? And how could you give away your last farthing and yet rob and murder!
<p/>Ah,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cried suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``that money you gave Katerina Ivanovna... that money.... Can that money...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Sonia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) broke in hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">``that money was not it.
<p/>Don't worry yourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the day I gave it to you....
<p/>Razumihin saw it... he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) received it for me.... That money was mine--my own. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Sonia listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) in bewilderment and did her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) utmost to comprehend.
<p/>'' And that money.... I don't even know really whether there was any money,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) added softly, as though reflecting. ''
<p/>I took a purse off her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) neck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something... but I didn't look in it
<p/>And the things--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse next morning in a yard off the V-- Prospect.
<p/>; I suppose I hadn't time.... They are all there now... '' Sonia strained every nerve to listen. '' Then why... why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?
<p/>I haven't yet decided whether to take that money or not,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gave a brief ironical smile.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) asked quickly, catching at a straw. '' I don't know... '' Ach, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?''
<p/>The thought flashed through Sonia's mind, wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mad? But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) dismissed it at once. '' No, it was something else.
<p/>Do you know, Sonia,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said suddenly with conviction, <div class="bookquote">``let me tell you: if I'd simply killed because I was hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>laying stress on every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I should be happy now.
<p/>What would it matter to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cried a moment later with a sort of despair, <div class="bookquote">``what would it matter to you if I were to confess that I did wrong?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could make nothing of it, nothing. '' You must believe that! What do you gain by such a stupid triumph over me?
<p/>Ah, Sonia, was it for that I've come to you to-day?'' Again Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.
<p/>'' I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left.'' <div class="bookquote">``Go where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>asked Sonia timidly.
<p/>And you know, Sonia, it's only now, only this moment that I understand where I asked you to go with me yesterday!
<p/>'' Not to steal and not to murder, don't be anxious,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) smiled bitterly. '' We are so different.... Yesterday when I said it I did not know where.
<p/>I asked you for one thing, I came to you for one thing--not to leave me. You won't leave me, Sonia?''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hand. '' And why, why did I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)? Why did I let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) know? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cried a minute later in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>'' Here you expect an explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see that. But what can I tell you?
<p/>You won't understand and will only suffer misery... on my account! Well, you are crying and embracing me again. Why do you do it?
<p/>Because I couldn't bear my burden and have come to throw it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better!
<p/>And can you love such a mean wretch?'' '' But aren't you suffering, too?'' cried Sonia. Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) heart, and again for an instant softened it.
<p/>'' Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great deal. I have come because I am bad.
<p/>There are men who wouldn't have come. But I am a coward and... a mean wretch. But... never mind! That's not the point.
<p/>I must speak now, but I don't know how to begin. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) paused and sank into thought. '' Ach, we are so different,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) cried again, <div class="bookquote">``we are not alike.
<p/>And why, why did I come? I shall never forgive myself that.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no, it was a good thing you came,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>cried Sonia.
<p/>'' It's better I should know, far better!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) with anguish. '' What if it were really that?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) said, as though reaching a conclusion. '' Yes, that's what it was! I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why I killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)....
<p/>Do you understand now?'' '' N-no,'' Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly. '' Only speak, speak, I shall understand, I shall understand in myself !
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) kept begging him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>). '' You'll understand? Very well, we shall see!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) paused and was for some time lost in meditation.
<p/>It was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what if Napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) had not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) career with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things, there had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had to be murdered too to get money from her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) trunk -LRB-for his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) career, you understand-RRB-.
<p/>'' Well, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) have brought himself to that if there had been no other means? Wouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) have felt a pang at its being so far from monumental
<p/>Well, I must tell you that I worried myself fearfully over that `question' so that I was awfully ashamed when I guessed at last -LRB-all of a sudden, somehow-RRB- that it would not have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) the least pang, that it would not even have struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) that it was not monumental... that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) would not have seen that there was anything in it to pause over, and that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) had had no other way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) would have strangled her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in a minute without thinking about it!
<p/>and... and sinful, too? Well, I too... left off thinking about it... murdered her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), following his (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) example. And that's exactly how it was!
<p/>Do you think it funny? Yes, Sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that's just how it was. ''
<p/>Sonia did not think it at all funny. '' You had better tell me straight out... without examples,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) begged, still more timidly and scarcely audibly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Blanc</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), looked sadly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands. '' You are right again, Sonia. Of course that's all nonsense
<p/>You see, you know of course that my mother has scarcely anything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned to drudge as a governess.
<p/>I was a student, but I couldn't keep myself at the university and was forced for a time to leave it.
<p/>Even if I had lingered on like that, in ten or twelve years I might -LRB-with luck-RRB- hope to be some sort of teacher or clerk with a salary of a thousand roubles
<p/>'' -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) repeated it as though it were a lesson-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief and anxiety
<p/>, it's almost all talk! All their hopes were centered on me. and I could not succeed in keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in comfort while my sister...
<p/>And it's a hard thing to pass everything by all one's life, to turn one's back upon everything, to forget one's mother and decorously accept the insults inflicted on one's sister.
<p/>well, my sister might well have fared worse! Why should one? When one has buried them to burden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them again without a farthing?
<p/>So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman's money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother, to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving it--and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....
<p/>Well... that's all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I did wrong.... Well, that's enough. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) struggled to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) speech in exhaustion and let his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) head sink.
<p/>'' Oh, that's not it, that's not it,'' Sonia cried in distress. '' How could one... no, that's not right, not right.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You see yourself that it's not right. But I've spoken truly, it's the truth.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``As though that could be the truth!
<p/>Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, loathsome, harmful creature.''  (<font color='red'><b>a louse</b></font>)</div>'' A human being--a louse!'' <div class="bookquote">``I too know it wasn't a louse,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) answered, looking strangely at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>'' But I am talking nonsense, Sonia,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) added. '' I've been talking nonsense a long time.... That's not it, you are right there.
<p/>There were quite, quite other causes for it! I haven't talked to anyone for so long, Sonia.... My head aches dreadfully now.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was almost delirious; an uneasy smile strayed on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lips. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) terrible exhaustion could be seen through his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) excitement.
<p/>Sonia saw how he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was suffering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) too was growing dizzy. And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) talked so strangely; it seemed somehow comprehensible, but yet...
<p/>No, Sonia, that's not it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began again suddenly, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head, as though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were roused
<p/>'' But how, how! Good God! '' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands in despair. '' him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``that's not it! Better... imagine--yes, it's certainly better--
<p/>imagine that I am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive and... well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity. -LRB-Let's have it all out at once!
<p/>They've talked of madness already, I noticed.-RRB- I told you just now I could not keep myself at the university. But do you know that perhaps I might have done?
<p/>My mother would have sent me what I needed for the fees and I could have earned enough for clothes, boots and food, no doubt.
<p/>Lessons had turned up at half a rouble. Razumihin works! But I turned sulky and wouldn't. -LRB-Yes, sulkiness, that's the right word for it!-RRB-
<p/>I sat in my room like a spider. You've been in my den, you've seen it.... And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp the soul and the mind?
<p/>Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldn't go out of it! I wouldn't on purpose! I didn't go out for days together, and I wouldn't work
<p/>If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) didn't, I went all day without; I wouldn't ask, on purpose, from sulkiness!
<p/>, I wouldn't even eat, I just lay there doing nothing. At night I had no light, I lay in the dark and I wouldn't earn money for candles.
<p/>I ought to have studied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies thinking. And I kept thinking.... And I had dreams
<p/>all the time, strange dreams of all sorts, no need to describe! Only then I began to fancy that... No, that's not it!
<p/>Again I am telling you wrong! You see I kept asking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid--and I know they are--yet I won't be wiser?
<p/>Afterwards I understood that that would never come to pass, that men won't change and that nobody can alter it and that it's not worth wasting effort over it.
<p/>Then I saw, Sonia, that if one waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... Yes, that's so.
<p/>That's the law of their nature, Sonia,... that's so! ... And I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will have power over them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) who dares most of all will be most in the right!
<p/>Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their eyes. So it has been till now and so it will always be.
<p/>A man must be blind not to see it!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Though Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) no longer cared whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) understood or not.
<p/>The fever had complete hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) certainly had been too long without talking to anyone-RRB-.
<p/>I divined then, Sonia,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went on eagerly, <div class="bookquote">``that power is only vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up.
<p/>Sonia felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gloomy creed had become his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faith and code. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There is only one thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare!
<p/>Then for the first time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever thought of before me, no one!
<p/>I saw clear as daylight how strange it is that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil!
<p/>I... I wanted to have the daring ... and I killed her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). I only wanted to have the daring, Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!''
<p/>'' Oh hush, hush,'' cried Sonia, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands. '' You turned away from God and God has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became clear to me, was it a temptation of the devil, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, don't laugh, blasphemer! You don't understand, you don't understand! Oh God!

<p/>I know it all, I have thought it all over and over and whispered it all over to myself, lying there in the dark....
<p/>I know myself that it was the devil leading me. Hush, Sonia, hush! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) repeated with gloomy insistence. '' I've argued it all over with myself, every point of it, and I know it all, all!
<p/>And how sick, how sick I was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget it and make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking.
<p/>And you don't suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a wise man, and that was just my destruction.
<p/>And you mustn't suppose that I didn't know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether I had the right to gain power--I certainly hadn't the right--or that if I asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn't so for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goal without asking questions....
<p/>If I worried myself all those days, wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly of course that I wasn't Napoleon.
<p/>I had to endure all the agony of that battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone!
<p/>I didn't want to lie about it even to myself. It wasn't to help my mother I did the murder --that's nonsense--I didn't do the murder to gain wealth and power and to become a benefactor of mankind.
<p/>I simply did it; I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a benefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in my web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn't have cared at that moment....
<p/>Nonsense! And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It was not so much the money I wanted, but something else....
<p/>I know it all now.... Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder again. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led me on.
<p/>Whether I can step over barriers or not, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling creature or whether I have the right ...
<p/>I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse like everybody else or a man. '' ''
<p/>To kill? Have the right to kill? '' Sonia clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands. '' Ach, Sonia! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort, but was contemptuously silent.
<p/>I want to prove one thing only, that the devil led me on then and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) has shown me since that I had not the right to take that path, because I am just such a louse as all the rest.
<p/>'' Don't interrupt me, Sonia. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was mocking me and here I've come to you now! Welcome your guest! If I were not a louse, should I have come to you?
<p/>Listen: when I went then to the old woman's I only went to try .... You may be sure of that!''
<p/>'' And you murdered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!'' '' But how did I murder her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? Is that how men do murders? Do men go to commit a murder as I went then?
<p/>I will tell you some day how I went! Did I murder the old woman? I murdered myself, not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! I crushed myself once for all, for ever....
<p/>But it was the devil that killed that old woman, not I. Enough, enough, Sonia, enough! Let me be! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) cried in a sudden spasm of agony, <div class="bookquote">``let me be!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) knees and squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hands as in a vise. '' What suffering!''
<p/>A wail of anguish broke from Sonia. '' Well, what am I to do now? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) asked, suddenly raising his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) head and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) with a face hideously distorted by despair.
<p/>'' What are you to do? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cried, jumping up, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes that had been full of tears suddenly began to shine.
<p/>Go at once, this very minute, stand at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say to all men aloud, 'I am a murderer!'

<p/>All the facts they know can be explained two ways, that's to say I can turn their accusations to my credit, do you understand?

<p/>They sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as though they had been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) looked at Sonia and felt how great was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), and strange to say he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved.
<p/>Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?'' '' Oh, I will, I will. '' Yes, it was a strange and awful sensation!
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) way to see Sonia he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had felt that all his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) hopes rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) expected to be rid of at least part of his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) suffering, and now, when all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) heart turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) suddenly felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was immeasurably unhappier than before.

<p/>'' No, of course not. Here, take this one, of cypress wood. I have another, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta.
<p/>I changed with Lizaveta: she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) gave me her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cross and I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) my little ikon. I will wear Lizaveta's now and give you this.
<p/>Take it... it's mine! It's mine, you know,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>). '' We will go to suffer together, and together we will bear our cross!''

<p/>'' Not now, Sonia. Better later,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). '' Yes, yes, better,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) repeated with conviction, <div class="bookquote">``when you go to meet your suffering, then put it on.
<p/>You will come to me, I'll put it on you, we will pray and go together. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>At that moment someone knocked three times at the door.
<p/>'' Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in? '' they heard in a very familiar and polite voice. Sonia rushed to the door in a fright.
<p/>The flaxen head of Mr. Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door. CHAPTER V Lebeziatnikov looked perturbed. '' I've come to you, Sofya Semyonovna,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) began.
<p/>'' Excuse me... I thought I should find you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) said, addressing Raskolnikov suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``that is, I didn't mean anything... of that sort...
<p/>But I just thought... Katerina Ivanovna has gone out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) blurted out suddenly, turning from Raskolnikov to Sonia.
<p/>Sonia screamed. '' At least it seems so. But... we don't know what to do, you see! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) came back--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhaps beaten....
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had run to your father's former chief, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) didn't find him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) at home: he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was dining at some other general's...
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was so persistent that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) managed to get the chief to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), had him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) fetched out from dinner, it seems.
<p/>So it seems at least,... Only fancy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) rushed off there, to the other general's, and, imagine You can imagine what happened.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was turned out, of course; but, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) own story, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) abused him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) and threw something at him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>). One may well believe it....
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is telling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna; but it's difficult to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is screaming and flinging herself about....
<p/>Oh yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) shouts that since everyone has abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) will take the children and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children will sing and dance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) too, and collect money, and will go every day under the general's window... `to let everyone see well-born children, whose father was an official, begging in the street.'
<p/>How it is she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) wasn't taken up, I can't understand! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) keeps beating the children and they are all crying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is teaching Lida to sing `My Village,' the boy to dance, Polenka the same.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is tearing up all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) means to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of music....
<p/>Lebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) almost breathless, snatched up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cloak and hat, and ran out of the room, putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) things as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) went.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) won't listen to anything.... Imagine the state of things! It's beyond anything! '' Raskolnikov followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and Lebeziatnikov came after him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>I didn't want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna, so I said `it seemed like it,' but there isn't a doubt of it.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) has certainly gone mad!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said to Raskolnikov, as they went out into the street. '' They say that in consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; it's a pity I know nothing of medicine.
<p/>I did try to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) wouldn't listen. '' <div class="bookquote">``Did you talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) about the tubercles?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not precisely of the tubercles.
<p/>But what I say is, that if you convince a person logically that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) has nothing to cry about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'ll stop crying.
<p/>Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) wouldn't have understood! That's clear. Is it your conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) won't?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Life would be too easy if it were so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>answered Raskolnikov.
<p/>Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for Katerina Ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in Paris they have been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the insane, simply by logical argument?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) idea was that there's nothing really wrong with the physical organism of the insane, and that insanity is, so to say, a logical mistake, an error of judgment, an incorrect view of things.
<p/>'' One professor there, a scientific man of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such treatment. He (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) gradually showed the madman his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) error and, would you believe it, they say he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) was successful?
<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) made use of douches too, how far success was due to that treatment remains uncertain.... So it seems at least.
<p/>'' Raskolnikov had long ceased to listen. Reaching the house where he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate.
<p/>Lebeziatnikov woke up with a start, looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) and hurried on. Raskolnikov went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) little room and stood still in the middle of it.
<p/>Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) come back here? He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked at the yellow and tattered paper, at the dust, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sofa.... From the yard came a loud continuous knocking; someone seemed to be hammering...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went to the window, rose on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of absorbed attention.
<p/>But the yard was empty and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not see who was hammering. In the house on the left he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw some open windows; on the window-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums.
<p/>Linen was hung out of the windows... He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knew it all by heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned away and sat down on the sofa.
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt once more that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would perhaps come to hate Sonia, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) more miserable.
<p/>Never, never had he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt himself so fearfully alone! '' Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) to beg for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) tears?
<p/>What need had he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to poison her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) life? Oh, the meanness of it!'' <div class="bookquote">``I will remain alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said resolutely, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) shall not come to the prison!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Five minutes later he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head with a strange smile. That was a strange thought. '' Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought suddenly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not have said how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sat there with vague thoughts surging through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind. All at once the door opened and Dounia came in.
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) stood still and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) from the doorway, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had done at Sonia; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) came in and sat down in the same place as yesterday, on the chair facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked silently and almost vacantly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). '' Don't be angry, brother; I've only come for one minute,'' said Dounia.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes were bright and soft. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) too had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with love.
<p/>'' Brother, now I know all, all . Dmitri Prokofitch has explained and told me everything. They are worrying and persecuting you through a stupid and contemptible suspicion....
<p/>Dmitri Prokofitch told me that there is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such horror.
<p/>I don't think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must be, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you.
<p/>As for your cutting yourself off from us, I don't judge you, I don't venture to judge you, and forgive me for having blamed you for it.
<p/>That's what I am afraid of. I feel that I too, if I had so great a trouble, should keep away from everyone.
<p/>I shall tell mother nothing of this , but I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) from you that you will come very soon.
<p/>Don't worry about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); I will set her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind at rest; but don't you try her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) too much--come once at least; remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is your mother.
<p/>And now I have come simply to say'' -LRB-Dounia began to get up-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``that if you should need me or should need... all my life or anything... call me, and I'll come.
<p/>Good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned abruptly and went towards the door. <div class="bookquote">``Dounia! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and went towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). '' That Razumihin, Dmitri Prokofitch, is a very good fellow.
<p/>'' Dounia flushed slightly. '' Well? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked, waiting a moment. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love....
<p/>Good-bye, Dounia.'' Dounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took alarm. '' But what does it mean, brother? Are we really parting for ever that you... give me such a parting message?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind.... Good-bye. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) turned away, and walked to the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood a moment, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) uneasily, and went out troubled.
<p/>There was an instant -LRB-the very last one-RRB- when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had longed to take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) arms and say good-bye to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and even to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had not dared even to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand. ''
<p/>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was not cold to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may shudder when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remembers that I embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and will feel that I stole her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kiss.''
<p/>'' And would she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stand that test? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went on a few minutes later to himself. '' No, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wouldn't; girls like that can't stand things!
<p/>They never do. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thought of Sonia. There was a breath of fresh air from the window. The daylight was fading.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cap and went out. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was.
<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this continual inner strain helped to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) legs and in possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) faculties.
<p/>But all this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). But this artificial excitement could not last long.
<p/>There was nothing poignant, nothing acute about it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it; it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a foretaste of an eternity <div class="bookquote">``on a square yard of space.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special form of misery had begun to oppress him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) of late. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Towards evening this sensation usually began to weigh on him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) more heavily.
<p/>'' With this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending on the sunset or something, one can't help doing something stupid! You'll go to Dounia, as well as to Sonia,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) muttered bitterly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) name called. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) looked round. Lebeziatnikov rushed up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>). '' Only fancy, I've been to your room looking for you.
<p/>Only fancy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)'s carried out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) plan, and taken away the children. Sofya Semyonovna and I have had a job to find them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is rapping on a frying-pan and making the children dance. The children are crying. They keep stopping at the cross-roads and in front of shops; there's a crowd of fools running after them.
<p/>Come along!'' <div class="bookquote">``And Sonia? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after Lebeziatnikov. <div class="bookquote">``Simply frantic. That is, it's not Sofya Semyonovna's frantic, but Katerina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonova's frantic too.
<p/>But Katerina Ivanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is quite mad. They'll be taken to the police. You can fancy what an effect that will have....
<p/>On the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one where Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principally of gutter children.
<p/>The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could be heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle likely to attract a street crowd.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) old dress with the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way on one side, was really frantic.
<p/>They are on the canal bank, near the bridge now, not far from Sofya Semyonovna's, quite close. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was exhausted and breathless.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed out of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed them, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, began explaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation by their not understanding, beat them....
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would make a rush at the crowd; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) immediately appealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) to see what these children <div class="bookquote">``from a genteel, one may say aristocratic, house''  (<font color='red'><b>these children</b></font>)</div>had been brought to.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) heard laughter or jeering in the crowd, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would rush at once at the scoffers and begin squabbling with them.
<p/>Some people laughed, others shook their heads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the frightened children.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) excitement did not flag, and every moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) irritation grew more intense. The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken was not there, at least Raskolnikov did not see it.
<p/>But instead of rapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) wasted hands, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) too joined in the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) curse in despair and even shed tears.
<p/>What made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) most furious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed.
<p/>There had been no costume for Lida; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) simply had a red knitted cap, or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with a broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina Ivanovna's grandmother's and had been preserved as a family possession.
<p/>Polenka was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) everyday dress; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) looked in timid perplexity at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mother, and kept at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) side, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) tears.
<p/>The boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) dimly realised her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mother's condition, and looked uneasily about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was terribly frightened of the street and the crowd. Sonia followed Katerina Ivanovna, weeping and beseeching her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) to return home, but Katerina Ivanovna was not to be persuaded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave off, Sonia, leave off,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) shouted, speaking fast, panting and coughing. '' You don't know what you ask; you are like a child!
<p/>Let everyone, let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets, though their father was an honourable man who served all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life in truth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service.
<p/>I've told you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German. '' -LRB-Katerina Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly believed it.-RRB-
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let that wretch of a general see it! And you are silly, Sonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that.
<p/>We have worried you enough, I won't go on so! Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cried, seeing Raskolnikov and rushing up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Even organ-grinders earn their living, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary.
<p/>'' Explain to this silly girl, please, that nothing better could be done! And that general will lose his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) post, you'll see!
<p/>We shall perform under his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) windows every day, and if the Tsar drives by, I'll fall on my knees, put the children before me, show them to him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>), and say `Defend us father.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is the father of the fatherless, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is merciful, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll protect us, you'll see, and that wretch of a general....
<p/>Lida, tenez vous droite ! Kolya, you'll dance again. Why are you whimpering? Whimpering again! What are you afraid of, stupid?
<p/>Goodness, what am I to do with them, Rodion Romanovitch? If you only knew how stupid they are! What's one to do with such children?
<p/>Raskolnikov tried to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) vanity, that it was unseemly for her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be wandering about the streets like an organ-grinder, as she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was intending to become the principal of a boarding-school.
<p/>'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), almost crying herself--which did not stop her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uninterrupted, rapid flow of talk--pointed to the crying children. '' A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha!
<p/>A castle in the air,'' cried Katerina Ivanovna, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) laugh ending in a cough. '' No, Rodion Romanovitch, that dream is over!
<p/>All have forsaken us!... And that general.... You know, Rodion Romanovitch, I threw an inkpot at him (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) --it happened to be standing in the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name.
<p/>I wrote my name, threw it at him (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) and ran away. Oh, the scoundrels, the scoundrels! But enough of them, now I'll provide for the children myself, I won't bow down to anybody!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has had to bear enough for us!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pointed to Sonia. '' Polenka, how much have you got? Show me!
<p/>What, only two farthings! Oh, the mean wretches! They give us nothing, only run after us, putting their tongues out. There, what is that blockhead laughing at?
<p/>'' -LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pointed to a man in the crowd.-RRB- '' It's all because Kolya here is so stupid ; I have such a bother with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Else how are you to show that you are of good family, well brought-up children, and not at all like other organ-grinders?
<p/>What do you want, Polenka? Tell me in French, parlez-moi français . Why, I've taught you, you know some phrases. We aren't going to have a Punch and Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteel song....
<p/>You keep putting me out, but we... you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, to find something to sing and get money, something Kolya can dance to....
<p/>We must talk it over and rehearse it all thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky, where there are far more people of good society, and we shall be noticed at once.
<p/>Ah, yes,... What are we to sing? For, as you can fancy, our performance is all impromptu.... Lida knows `My Village' only, nothing but '
<p/>My Village,' and everyone sings that. We must sing something far more genteel.... Well, have you thought of anything, Polenka? If only you'd help your mother!
<p/>My memory's quite gone, or I should have thought of something. We really can't sing `An Hussar.' Ah, let us sing in French, `Cinq sous,' I have taught it you, I have taught it you.
<p/>And as it is in French, people will see at once that you are children of good family, and that will be much more touching....
<p/>You might sing `Marlborough s`en va-t-en guerre,' for that's quite a child's song and is sung as a lullaby in all the aristocratic houses.
<p/>'' Marlborough s`en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra ... '' she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) began singing. '' But no, better sing `Cinq sous.'
<p/>Now, Kolya, your hands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, keep turning the other way, and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands! ''

<p/>'' Now it's particularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly, that all may see that you are well-born children. I said at the time that the bodice should be cut longer, and made of two widths.
<p/>It was your fault, Sonia, with your advice to make it shorter, and now you see the child is quite deformed by it....
<p/>Why, you're all crying again! What's the matter, stupids? Come, Kolya, begin. Make haste, make haste! Oh, what an unbearable child! ''
<p/>Cinq sous, cinq sous. '' A policeman again! What do you want? '' A policeman was indeed forcing his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) way through the crowd.
<p/>But at that moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat--a solid-looking official of about fifty with a decoration on his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) neck -LRB-which delighted Katerina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman-RRB---approached and without a word handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) a green three-rouble note.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) face wore a look of genuine sympathy. Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) a polite, even ceremonious, bow. ''
<p/>The causes that have induced us -LRB-take the money, Polenka: you see there are generous and honourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress-RRB-.
<p/>You see, honoured sir, these orphans of good family--I might even say of aristocratic connections--and that wretch of a general sat eating grouse... and stamped at my disturbing him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>). '
<p/>Your excellency,' I said, `protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch, and on the very day of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) death the basest of scoundrels slandered his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) only daughter.'...
<p/>I thank you, honoured sir,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) began loftily. '' That policeman again! Protect me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cried to the official. '' Why is that policeman edging up to me?
<p/>We have only just run away from one of them. What do you want, fool?'' '' It's forbidden in the streets.
<p/>You mustn't make a disturbance. '' '' It's you're making a disturbance. It's just the same as if I were grinding an organ.
<p/>You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven't got one, and in that way you collect a crowd.
<p/>What business is it of yours?'' '' Where do you lodge?'' <div class="bookquote">``What, a license?''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>wailed Katerina Ivanovna. '' I buried my husband to-day.
<p/>What need of a license?'' <div class="bookquote">``Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the official</b></font>)</div>began the official. '' Come along; I will escort you.... This is no place for you in the crowd.
<p/>You are ill.'' <div class="bookquote">``Honoured sir, honoured sir, you don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>screamed Katerina Ivanovna. '' We are going to the Nevsky.... Sonia, Sonia!
<p/>Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is crying too! What's the matter with you all? Kolya, Lida, where are you going? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cried suddenly in alarm.
<p/>'' Kolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, and their mother's mad pranks, suddenly seized each other by the hand, and ran off at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere.
<p/>'' Oh, silly children! Kolya, Lida, where are they off to?... Weeping and wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was a piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) ran, weeping and panting for breath.
<p/>Sonia and Polenka rushed after them. '' Bring them back, bring them back, Sonia! Oh stupid, ungrateful children!... Polenka! catch them....
<p/>It's for your sakes I... '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) stumbled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) ran and fell down. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)'s cut herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)'s bleeding! Oh, dear!
<p/>Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were the first at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) side, the official too hastened up, and behind him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) the policeman who muttered, <div class="bookquote">``Bother!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the policeman Bother</b></font>)</div>cried Sonia, bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). All ran up and crowded around. '' with a gesture of impatience, feeling that the job was going to be a troublesome one.
<p/>'' Pass on! Pass on! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) said to the crowd that pressed forward. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)'s dying,'' someone shouted. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)'s gone out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mind,'' said another.
<p/>'' Lord have mercy upon us,'' said a woman, crossing herself. '' Have they caught the little girl and the boy?
<p/>When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had not cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood that stained the pavement red was from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) chest.
<p/>They're being brought back, the elder one's got them.... Ah, the naughty imps! '' '' I've seen that before,'' muttered the official to Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov; <div class="bookquote">``that's consumption; the blood flows and chokes the patient.
<p/>I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago... nearly a pint of blood, all in a minute....
<p/>What's to be done though? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) is dying.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lebeziatnikov/Andrey Semyonovitch/Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)</div>'' This way, this way, to my room!'' Sonia implored. '' I live here!...
<p/>See, that house, the second from here.... Come to me, make haste,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) turned from one to the other. <div class="bookquote">``Send for the doctor!
<p/>Oh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>the official</b></font>)</div>Thanks to the official's efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was carried to Sonia's room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed.
<p/>Raskolnikov, Lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed to the very door.
<p/>The blood was still flowing, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) seemed to be coming to herself. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who were trembling and weeping.
<p/>Several persons came in too from the Kapernaumovs' room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces.
<p/>Raskolnikov looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with surprise, not understanding where he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had come from and not having noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in the crowd.
<p/>The official whispered to Raskolnikov that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought it was too late now for the doctor, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to be sent for.
<p/>Among these, Svidrigaïlov suddenly made his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) appearance. A doctor and priest wore spoken of. Kapernaumov ran himself. Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) breath.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at Sonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) brow with a handkerchief.
<p/>The bleeding ceased for a time. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) asked to be raised. They sat her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) up on the bed, supporting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) on both sides.
<p/>'' Where are the children? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) said in a faint voice. '' You've brought them, Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run away....
<p/>Och! '' Once more her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) parched lips were covered with blood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes, looking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). '' So that's how you live, Sonia!
<p/>Never once have I been in your room. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) with a face of suffering. '' We have been your ruin, Sonia.
<p/>Polenka, Lida, Kolya, come here! Well, here they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand them over to you, I've had enough!
<p/>The ball is over. '' -LRB-Cough!-RRB- '' Lay me down, let me die in peace. '' They laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) back on the pillow.
<p/>'' What, the priest? I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>). You haven't got a rouble to spare. I have no sins. God must forgive me without that.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knows how I have suffered.... And if He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) won't forgive me, I don't care! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) sank more and more into uneasy delirium.
<p/>At times she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) shuddered, turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes from side to side, recognised everyone for a minute, but at once sank into delirium again.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) breathing was hoarse and difficult, there was a sort of rattle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) throat. '' I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), your excellency,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) ejaculated, gasping after each word.
<p/>'' That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah! Lida, Kolya, hands on your hips, make haste! Glissez, glissez! pas de basque! Tap with your heels, be a graceful child! ''
<p/>Du hast Diamanten und Perlen <div class="bookquote">``What next? That's the thing to sing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Du</b></font>)</div>Du hast die schonsten Augen Madchen, was willst du mehr?
<p/>'' What an idea! Was willst du mehr? What things the fool invents! Ah, yes! '' In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan.
<p/>'' Ah, how I loved it! I loved that song to distraction, Polenka! Your father, you know, used to sing it when we were engaged....
<p/>Oh those days! Oh that's the thing for us to sing! How does it go? I've forgotten. Remind me! How was it?
<p/>At last, in a horribly hoarse, broken voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) began, shrieking and gasping at every word, with a look of growing terror.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was violently excited and tried to sit up. '' In the heat of midday! ... in the vale!... of Dagestan!
<p/>... With lead in my breast!...'' <div class="bookquote">``Your excellency! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wailed suddenly with a heart-rending scream and a flood of tears, <div class="bookquote">``protect the orphans!
<p/>You have been their father's guest... one may say aristocratic... ''  (<font color='red'><b>a scream flood</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) started, regaining consciousness, and gazed at all with a sort of terror, but at once recognised Sonia.
<p/>'' Sonia, Sonia!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) articulated softly and caressingly, as though surprised to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) there. '' Sonia darling, are you here, too?
<p/>'' They lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) up again. '' Enough! It's over! Farewell, poor thing! I am done for! I am broken! ''
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) cried with vindictive despair, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) head fell heavily back on the pillow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mouth fell open, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) leg moved convulsively, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) gave a deep, deep sigh and died.
<p/>Sonia fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), and remained motionless with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) head pressed to the dead woman's wasted bosom.
<p/>Though Kolya and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling that it was something terrible; they put their hands on each other's little shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened their mouths and began screaming.
<p/>They were both still in their fancy dress; one in a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.
<p/>Polenka threw herself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mother's feet, kissing them and weeping violently. And how did <div class="bookquote">``the certificate of merit''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>come to be on the bed beside Katerina Ivanovna?
<p/>It lay there by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>). ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is dead,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) said. '' Rodion Romanovitch, I must have two words with you,'' said Svidrigaïlov, coming up to them.
<p/>Lebeziatnikov at once made room for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) and delicately withdrew. Svidrigaïlov drew Raskolnikov further away. '' I will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and that.
<p/>I will put those two little ones and Polenka into some good orphan asylum, and I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming of age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them.
<p/>You know it's a question of money and, as I told you, I have plenty to spare. And I will pull her (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) out of the mud too, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) is a good girl, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>)?
<p/>So tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) ten thousand.'' '' What is your motive for such benevolence?'' asked Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' Ah! you sceptical person! '' laughed Svidrigaïlov. '' I told you I had no need of that money. Won't you admit that it's simply done from humanity?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lebeziatnikov</b></font>) wasn't 'a louse,' you know'' -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pointed to the corner where the dead woman lay-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), like some old pawnbroker woman?
<p/>Come, you'll agree, is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to die? And if I didn't help them, Polenka would go the same way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white and cold, hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own phrases, spoken to Sonia.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) quickly stepped back and looked wildly at Svidrigaïlov. '' How do you know? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) whispered, hardly able to breathe.
<p/>'' Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich's, the other side of the wall. Here is Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame Resslich, an old and devoted friend of mine.
<p/>I am a neighbour. '' <div class="bookquote">``You?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>continued Svidrigaïlov, shaking with laughter. '' I assure you on my honour, dear Rodion Romanovitch, that you have interested me enormously.
<p/>I told you we should become friends, I foretold it. Well, here we have. And you will see what an accommodating person I am.
<p/>A strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had fallen upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and wrapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape.
<p/>Recalling that period long after, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) believed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with intervals, till the final catastrophe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been mistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date of certain events.
<p/>Anyway, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tried later on to piece his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) recollections together, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) learnt a great deal about himself from what other people told him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>You'll see that you can get on with me!'' PART VI CHAPTER I He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had mixed up incidents and had explained events as due to circumstances which existed only in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) imagination.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days, of complete apathy, which came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) as a reaction from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) previous terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes seen in the dying.
<p/>At times he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes to panic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape from a full and clear understanding of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) position.
<p/>How glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would have been to be free from some cares, the neglect of which would have threatened him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) with complete, inevitable ruin.
<p/>Certain essential facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) might be said to be permanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov.
<p/>From the time of Svidrigaïlov's too menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia's room at the moment of Katerina Ivanovna's death, the normal working of his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) mind seemed to break down.
<p/>At times, finding himself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had come there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) recognised suddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) ought at once to come to an understanding with that man and to make what terms he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) could.
<p/>Walking outside the city gates one day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) positively fancied that they had fixed a meeting there, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was waiting for Svidrigaïlov.
<p/>Another time he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes and could not at first understand how he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had come there.
<p/>But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna's death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia's lodging, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had gone aimlessly for a moment.
<p/>They exchanged a few words and made no reference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not to speak of it for a time.
<p/>But although this new fact caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) extreme uneasiness, Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. Katerina Ivanovna's body was still lying in the coffin, Svidrigaïlov was busy making arrangements for the funeral.
<p/>At their last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had made an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna's children; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had settled on them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place orphans with some property than destitute ones.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) said something too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see Raskolnikov, mentioning that ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would like to consult with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), that there were things they must talk over....
<p/>Svidrigaïlov looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) voice, asked: <div class="bookquote">``But how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you don't seem yourself?
<p/>Sonia too was very busy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. You look and you listen, but you don't seem to understand.
<p/>Cheer up! We'll talk things over; I am only sorry, I've so much to do of my own business and other people's.
<p/>Ah, Rodion Romanovitch,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) added suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``what all men need is fresh air, fresh air... more than anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who were coming up the stairs.
<p/>They had come for the requiem service. By Svidrigaïlov's orders it was sung twice a day punctually. Svidrigaïlov went his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) way.
<p/>Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed the priest into Sonia's room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood at the door. They began quietly, slowly and mournfully singing the service.
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) childhood the thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive and mysteriously awful; and it was long since he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had heard the requiem service.
<p/>And there was something else here as well, too awful and disturbing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the coffin; Polenka was weeping.
<p/>Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as it were, timidly weeping. '' These last two days she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hasn't said a word to me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hasn't glanced at me,'' Raskolnikov thought suddenly.
<p/>The sunlight was bright in the room; the incense rose in clouds; the priest read, <div class="bookquote">``Give rest, oh Lord... ''  (<font color='red'><b>priest</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov stayed all through the service.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) blessed them and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service, Raskolnikov went up to Sonia.
<p/>It seemed strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) that there was no trace of repugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hand.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) took both his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hands and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) head sink on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewildered Raskolnikov. It was the furthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) interpreted it.
<p/>If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would have thought himself lucky, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) whole life there.
<p/>Sonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hand and went out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt very miserable. But although he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had almost always been by himself of late, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had never been able to feel alone.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walked out of the town on to the high road, once he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier the place was, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>It did not frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), but greatly annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) made haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares.
<p/>One day at dusk he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sat for an hour listening to songs in a tavern and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) positively enjoyed it.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt easier and even more solitary. But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again, as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) conscience smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt at once that that was not the only cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) uneasiness; there was something requiring immediate decision, but it was something he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not clearly understand or put into words.
<p/>'' Here I sit listening to singing, is that what I ought to be doing? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought. It was a hopeless tangle.
<p/>'' No, better the struggle again! Better Porfiry again... or Svidrigaïlov.... Better some challenge again... some attack. Yes, yes!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went out of the tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother suddenly reduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) almost to a panic.
<p/>That night he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) woke up before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling all over with fever; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walked home, and it was early morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) arrived.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered that Katerina Ivanovna's funeral had been fixed for that day, and was glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was not present at it.
<p/>After some hours' sleep the fever left him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) woke up late, two o'clock in the afternoon. Nastasya brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) some food; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head was fresher and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was calmer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been for the last three days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) even felt a passing wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) previous attacks of panic.
<p/>The door opened and Razumihin came in. '' Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'s eating, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'s not ill,'' said Razumihin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) took a chair and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) spoke with evident annoyance, but without hurry or raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) voice.
<p/>As far as I am concerned, you may all go to hell, but from what I see, it's clear to me that I can't make head or tail of it; please don't think I've come to ask you questions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had some special fixed determination. <div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began resolutely. '' I don't want to know, hang it!
<p/>If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say I shouldn't stay to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come to find out once for all whether it's a fact that you are mad?
<p/>I admit I've been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid, repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior to your mother and sister.
<p/>There is a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. Only a monster or a madman could treat them as you have; so you must be mad.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``When did you see them last?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just now. Haven't you seen them since then? What have you been doing with yourself?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wouldn't hear a word. '
<p/>Tell me, please. I've been to you three times already. Your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday. If he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) is ill, if his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) mind is giving way, who can look after him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) like his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) mother?'
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. We all came here together, we couldn't let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) come alone all the way. We kept begging her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to be calm.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got up and said: `If he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>)'s gone out, that is, if he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) is well, and has forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) mother, it's humiliating and unseemly for his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) mother to stand at his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) door begging for kindness.'
<p/>We came in, you weren't here; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat down, and stayed ten minutes, while we stood waiting in silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) returned home and took to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bed; now she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is in a fever. '
<p/>I see,' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, `that he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) has time for his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) girl .' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) means by your girl Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I don't know.
<p/>I went at once to Sofya Semyonovna's, for I wanted to know what was going on. I looked round, I saw the coffin, the children crying, and Sofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses.
<p/>No sign of you. I apologised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. So that's all nonsense and you haven't got a girl; the most likely thing is that you are mad.
<p/>But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though you'd not had a bite for three days. Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but though you have not said a word to me yet...
<p/>So you may go to hell, all of you, for there's some mystery, some secret about it, and I don't intend to worry my brains over your secrets.
<p/>you are not mad! That I'd swear! Above all, you are not mad! So I've simply come to swear at you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) finished, getting up, <div class="bookquote">``to relieve my mind.
<p/>And I know what to do now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' What do you mean to do now?'' '' What business is it of yours what I mean to do?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going in for a drinking bout. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How... how did you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's pretty plain. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin paused for a minute.
<p/>'' You always have been a very rational person and you've never been mad, never,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) observed suddenly with warmth. ''
<p/>You're right: I shall drink. Good-bye! '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) moved to go out. '' I was talking with my sister--the day before yesterday, I think it was--about you, Razumihin.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``About me! But... where can you have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) the day before yesterday? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Razumihin/Mr. Razumihin</b></font>)</div>Razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale.
<p/>One could see that his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) heart was throbbing slowly and violently. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) came here by herself, sat there and talked to me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

I mean, about me?'' <div class="bookquote">``I told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) you were a very good, honest, and industrious man.
<p/>I didn't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) you love her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knows that herself.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knows that herself?''

<p/>I say this because I know quite well how you love her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and am convinced of the purity of your heart.
<p/>I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) too may love you and perhaps does love you already. Now decide for yourself, as you know best, whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rodya! You see... well.... Ach, damn it! But where do you mean to go? Of course, if it's all a secret, never mind....
<p/>I shall find out the secret... and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense and that you've made it all up.
<p/>That was just what I wanted to add, only you interrupted, that that was a very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets.
<p/>But I... Anyway you are a capital fellow, a capital fellow!... ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Leave it to time, don't worry about it.
<p/>You'll know it all in time when it must be. Yesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air.
<p/>I mean to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) directly to find out what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant by that. '' Razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, making a silent conclusion.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'s a political conspirator! He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) must be. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'s on the eve of some desperate step, that's certain. It can only be that!
<p/>So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) said, weighing each syllable, <div class="bookquote">``and you're going to see a man who says we need more air, and
<p/>And... and Dounia knows,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought suddenly. '' so of course that letter ... that too must have something to do with it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) concluded to himself.
<p/>'' What letter?'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) got a letter to-day. It upset her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) very much--very much indeed. Too much so. I began speaking of you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) begged me not to.
<p/>Then... then she (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) said that perhaps we should very soon have to part... then she (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) began warmly thanking me for something; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) room and locked herself in.''
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) got a letter? '' Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully. '' Yes, and you didn't know? hm... '' They were both silent.
<p/>'' Good-bye, Rodion. There was a time, brother, when I.... Never mind, good-bye. You see, there was a time.... Well, good-bye!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hurried out; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had almost closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) suddenly opened it again, and said, looking away: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know Porfiry's, that old woman?
<p/>I must be off too. I am not going to drink. There's no need now.... That's all stuff!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Do you know the murderer has been found, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) has confessed and given the proofs.
<p/>Would you believe it, all that scene of fighting and laughing with his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) companions on the stairs while the porter and the two witnesses were going up, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) got up on purpose to disarm suspicion.
<p/>It's one of those very workmen, the painter, only fancy! Do you remember I defended them here? The cunning, the presence of mind of the young dog!
<p/>One can hardly credit it; but it's his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) own explanation, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) has confessed it all. And what a fool I was about it!
<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>)'s simply a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of the lawyers--so there's nothing much to wonder at, I suppose!
<p/>Of course people like that are always possible. And the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) couldn't keep up the character, but confessed, makes him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) easier to believe in.
<p/>But what a fool I was! I was frantic on their side!'' <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why does it interest you so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><p/>Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation. '' What next? You ask me why it interests me!... Well, I heard it from Porfiry, among others...
<p/>It was from him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) I heard almost all about it.'' <div class="bookquote">``From Porfiry?

<p/>But no matter, another time! ... What need is there for me to drink now? You have made me drunk without wine.
<p/>I am drunk, Rodya! Good-bye, I'm going. I'll come again very soon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went out. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'s a political conspirator, there's not a doubt about it,'' Razumihin decided, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) slowly descended the stairs.
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'s drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) sister in ; that's quite, quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovna's character. There are interviews between them!...
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hinted at it too... So many of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) words.... and hints... bear that meaning! And how else can all this tangle be explained?
<p/>Hm! And I was almost thinking... Good heavens, what I thought! Yes, I took leave of my senses and I wronged him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)!
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day. Pfoo! What a crude, nasty, vile idea on my part!
<p/>Nikolay is a brick, for confessing.... And how clear it all is now! His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) illness then, all his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) strange actions... before this, in the university, how morose he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) used to be, how gloomy....
<p/>But what's the meaning now of that letter? There's something in that, too, perhaps. Whom was it from? I suspect...! No, I must find out!''
<p/>As soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window, walked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the smallness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) room, and sat down again on the sofa.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought of Dounia, realising all he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had heard and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart throbbed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suddenly broke into a run. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt, so to speak, renewed; again the struggle, so a means of escape had come.
<p/>'' Yes, a means of escape had come! It had been too stifling, too cramping, the burden had been too agonising.
<p/>A lethargy had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) at times. From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry's he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been suffocating, penned in without hope of escape.
<p/>After Nikolay's confession, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) behaviour and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) last words had been utterly unlike anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could have imagined beforehand; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had grown feebler, instantly and fundamentally!
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had agreed at the time with Sonia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had agreed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not go on living alone with such a thing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind! ''
<p/>And Svidrigaïlov was a riddle... He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) worried him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), that was true, but somehow not on the same point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) might still have a struggle to come with Svidrigaïlov.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov, too, might be a means of escape; but Porfiry was a different matter. '' And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, had explained it psychologically .
<p/>But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe that Nikolay was guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay's appearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could have only one explanation?
<p/>-LRB-During those days Raskolnikov had often recalled passages in that scene with Porfiry; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not bear to let his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind rest on it.-RRB-
<p/>Such words, such gestures had passed between them, they had exchanged such glances, things had been said in such a tone and had reached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen through at the first word, at the first gesture, could not have shaken his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) conviction.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had begun bringing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) damned psychology again! Porfiry? '' And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect!
<p/>The scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had rushed to Porfiry.... But what had induced the latter to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) like that?
<p/>What had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay? He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) must have some plan; there was some design, but what was it?
<p/>It was true that a long time had passed since that morning--too long a time--and no sight nor sound of Porfiry.
<p/>Well, that was a bad sign... '' Raskolnikov took his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cap and went out of the room, still pondering. It was the first time for a long while that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had felt clear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind, at least.
<p/>I must settle Svidrigaïlov,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and as soon as possible; he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), too, seems to be waiting for me to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) of my own accord.
<p/>And at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) weary heart that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) might have killed either of those two--Porfiry or Svidrigaïlov.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' At least he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) would be capable of doing it later, if not now. '' We shall see, we shall see,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) repeated to himself.
<p/>But no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) opened the door than he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) stumbled upon Porfiry himself in the passage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was coming in to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>).
<p/>Raskolnikov was dumbfounded for a minute, but only for one minute. Strange to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was not very much astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) guard. '' Perhaps this will mean the end? But how could Porfiry have approached so quietly, like a cat, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had heard nothing?
<p/>I've been meaning to look in a long time; I was passing by and thought why not go in for five minutes.
<p/>Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) have been listening at the door?'' <div class="bookquote">``You didn't expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Porfiry explained, laughing. '' Are you going out?
<p/>Raskolnikov gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) visitor a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would have marvelled at himself, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could have seen it.
<p/>I won't keep you long. Just let me have one cigarette.'' <div class="bookquote">``Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained!
<p/>So a man will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand, yet when the knife is at his (<font color='blue'><b>brigand</b></font>) throat at last, he (<font color='blue'><b>brigand</b></font>) feels no fear.
<p/>Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) without flinching. Porfiry screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes and began lighting a cigarette.
<p/>'' Speak, speak,'' seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov's heart. '' Come, why don't you speak?'' CHAPTER II <div class="bookquote">``Ah these cigarettes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div><p/>Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, having lighted one. '' They are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I can't give them up!
<p/>I cough, I begin to have tickling in my throat and a difficulty in breathing. You know I am a coward
<p/>, I went lately to Dr. B--n; he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) always gives at least half an hour to each patient. He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) positively laughed looking at me; he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) sounded me: `Tobacco's bad for you,' he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) said, `your lungs are affected.'
<p/>But how am I to give it up? What is there to take its place? I don't drink, that's the mischief, he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)-
<p/>he-he, that I don't. Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch, everything is relative!'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)'s playing his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) professional tricks again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov thought with disgust.
<p/>All the circumstances of their last interview suddenly came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) then.
<p/>'' I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didn't know? '' Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking round the room.
<p/>'' I came into this very room. I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thought I'd return your call.
<p/>I walked in as your door was wide open , I looked round, waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant.
<p/>Don't you lock your door? '' Raskolnikov's face grew more and more gloomy. Porfiry seemed to guess his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) state of mind.
<p/>I owe you an explanation and must give it to you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) continued with a slight smile, just patting Raskolnikov's knee.
<p/>But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face; to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it.
<p/>'' I've come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had never seen and never suspected such an expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch. Our first interview, too, was a strange one; but then... and one thing after another!
<p/>This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you; I feel it. Do you remember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged and your knees were shaking and so were mine.
<p/>And, you know, our behaviour was unseemly, even ungentlemanly. And yet we are gentlemen, above all, in any case, gentlemen; that must be understood.
<p/>Do you remember what we came to?... and it was quite indecorous. '' '' What is he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up to, what does he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) take me for?
<p/>I've decided openness is better between us,'' Porfiry Petrovitch went on, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head away and dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes, as though unwilling to disconcert his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) former victim and as though disdaining his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) former wiles.
<p/>'' Raskolnikov asked himself in amazement, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry. '' '' Yes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long.
<p/>Nikolay put a stop to it, or I don't know what we might not have come to. That damned workman was sitting at the time in the next room--can you realise that?
<p/>But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for anyone, I had made no kind of arrangements.
<p/>You know that, of course; and I am aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) came to you afterwards. You ask why I hadn't? What shall I say to you?
<p/>it had all come upon me so suddenly. I had scarcely sent for the porters -LRB-you noticed them as you went out, I dare say-RRB-.
<p/>An idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time, you see, Rodion Romanovitch. Come, I thought--even if I let one thing slip for a time, I shall get hold of something else
<p/>You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament; it's out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character, which I flatter myself
<p/>Of course I did reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and blurts out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole story.
<p/>--I shan't lose what I want, anyway. I have to some extent divined. It does happen sometimes, if you make a man lose all patience, though even then it's rare.
<p/>If I only had a fact, I thought, the least little fact to go upon, something I could lay hold of, something tangible, not merely psychological.
<p/>For if a man is guilty, you must be able to get something substantial out of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); one may reckon upon most surprising results indeed.
<p/>I was capable of realising that. I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch, on your temperament above all things! I had great hopes of you at that time.''
<p/>'' But what are you driving at now? '' Raskolnikov muttered at last, asking the question without thinking. '' What is he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) talking about?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wondered distractedly, <div class="bookquote">``does he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) really take me to be innocent?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' What am I driving at? I've come to explain myself, I consider it my duty, so to speak.
<p/>I want to make clear to you how the whole business, the whole misunderstanding arose. I've caused you a great deal of suffering, Rodion Romanovitch.
<p/>I understand what it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate, but who is proud, imperious and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment!
<p/>I regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without elements of magnanimity, though I don't agree with all your convictions.
<p/>I am not a monster. I wanted to tell you this first, frankly and quite sincerely, for above all I don't want to deceive you.
<p/>When I made your acquaintance, I felt attracted by you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a right to.
<p/>You may think what you like, but I desire now to do all I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart and conscience.
<p/>I know you disliked me from the first and indeed you've no reason to like me. I speak sincerely. '' Porfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause.
<p/>Raskolnikov felt a rush of renewed alarm. The thought that Porfiry believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to be innocent began to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) uneasy.
<p/>'' It's scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail,'' Porfiry Petrovitch went on. '' Indeed, I could scarcely attempt it.
<p/>To begin with there were rumours. Through whom, how, and when those rumours came to me... and how they affected you, I need not go into.
<p/>My suspicions were aroused by a complete accident, which might just as easily not have happened. What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to go into that either.
<p/>I admit it openly--for one may as well make a clean breast of it--I was the first to pitch on you.
<p/>Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind. The old woman's notes on the pledges and the rest of it--that all came to nothing.
<p/>I happened, too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who described it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with great vividness.
<p/>Yours was one of a hundred. It was just one thing after another, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow! How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas?
<p/>From a hundred rabbits you can't make a horse, a hundred suspicions don't make a proof, as the English proverb says, but that's only from the rational point of view--you can't help being partial, for after all a lawyer is only human.
<p/>I thought, too, of your article in that journal, do you remember, on your first visit we talked of it? I jeered at you at the time, but that was only to lead you on.
<p/>I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch, you are ill and impatient. That you were bold, headstrong, in earnest and... had felt a great deal I recognised long before.
<p/>I, too, have felt the same, so that your article seemed familiar to me. It was conceived on sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and suppressed enthusiasm.
<p/>I jeered at you then, but let me tell you that, as a literary amateur, I am awfully fond of such first essays, full of the heat of youth.
<p/>And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is dangerous! There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist.
<p/>Your article is absurd and fantastic, but there's a transparent sincerity, a youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it.
<p/>It's a gloomy article, but that's what's fine in it. I read your article and put it aside, thinking as I did so `that man won't go the common way.'
<p/>Well, I ask you, after that as a preliminary, how could I help being carried away by what followed? Oh, dear, I am not saying anything, I am not making any statement now.
<p/>I simply noted it at the time. What is there in it? I reflected. There's nothing in it, that is really nothing and perhaps absolutely nothing.
<p/>: here I have Nikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--you may think what you like of it, but it's evidence.
<p/>And it's not at all the thing for the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) brings in his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) psychology, too; one has to consider him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>), too, for it's a matter of life and death.
<p/>Why am I explaining this to you? That you may understand, and not blame my malicious behaviour on that occasion. It was not malicious, I assure you, he-he!
<p/>I was here when you were lying ill in bed, not officially, not in my own person, but I was here.
<p/>Do you suppose I didn't come to search your room at the time? I did, I did, he-he! Your room was searched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but umsonst !
<p/>I thought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself and quickly, too; if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s guilty, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s sure to come.
<p/>We arranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread rumours, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin is not a man to restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indignation.
<p/>Another man wouldn't, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will. And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing the subject with you? Mr. Zametov was tremendously struck by your anger and your open daring.
<p/>Think of blurting out in a restaurant 'I killed her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).' It was too daring, too reckless. I thought so myself, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) is guilty he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) will be a formidable opponent.
<p/>That was what I thought at the time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Zametov over and... well, you see, it all lies in this--that this damnable psychology can be taken two ways!
<p/>Well, I kept expecting you, and so it was, you came! My heart was fairly throbbing. Ach! '' Now, why need you have come?
<p/>I saw it all plain as daylight, but if I hadn't expected you so specially, I should not have noticed anything in your laughter.
<p/>Your laughter, too, as you came in, do you remember? You see what influence a mood has! Mr. Razumihin then--ah, that stone, that stone under which the things were hidden!
<p/>I seem to see it somewhere in a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden, you told Zametov and afterwards you repeated that in my office?
<p/>And when we began picking your article to pieces, how you explained it! One could take every word of yours in two senses, as though there were another meaning hidden.
<p/>So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the furthest limit, and knocking my head against a post, I pulled myself up, asking myself what I was about.
<p/>After all, I said, you can take it all in another sense if you like, and it's more natural so, indeed.
<p/>'' I couldn't help admitting it was more natural. I was bothered! ' No, I'd better get hold of some little fact' I said.
<p/>So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held my breath and was all in a tremor. ' Here is my little fact,' thought I, and I didn't think it over, I simply wouldn't.
<p/>I would have given a thousand roubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes, when you walked a hundred paces beside that workman, after he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) had called you murderer to your face, and you did not dare to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) a question all the way.
<p/>And then what about your trembling, what about your bell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium? '' And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I played such pranks on you?
<p/>And what made you come at that very minute? Someone seemed to have sent you, by Jove! And if Nikolay had not parted us... and do you remember Nikolay at the time?
<p/>Do you remember him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) clearly? It was a thunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)! I didn't believe in the thunderbolt, not for a minute.
<p/>Even afterwards, when you had gone and he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) began making very, very plausible answers on certain points, so that I was surprised at him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) myself, even then I didn't believe his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) story!
<p/>You could see it for yourself; and how could I? You see what it is to be as firm as a rock!
<p/>No, thought I, Morgenfrüh . What has Nikolay got to do with it!'' <div class="bookquote">``Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had yourself assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) of it....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) had been listening in indescribable agitation, as this man who had seen through and through him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), went back upon himself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) voice failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) broke off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was afraid of believing it and did not believe it. In those still ambiguous words he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) kept eagerly looking for something more definite and conclusive.
<p/>'' Mr. Razumihin!'' cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a question from Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent. '' He-he-he!
<p/>But I had to put Mr. Razumihin off; two is company, three is none. Mr. Razumihin is not the right man, besides he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is an outsider.
<p/>To return to Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is, how I understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), that is?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) came running to me with a pale face.... But never mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), why bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) in? To begin with, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) is still a child and not exactly a coward, but something by way of an artist.
<p/>Really, don't laugh at my describing him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) so. He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) is innocent and responsive to influence. He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) has a heart, and is a fantastic fellow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) attends school too, and laughs till he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) cries if you hold up a finger to him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) will drink himself senseless--not as a regular vice, but at times, when people treat him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>), like a child.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) sings and dances, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) tells stories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) stole, too, then, without knowing it himself, for `How can it be stealing, if one picks it up?'
<p/>There have been Wanderers-LSB-*-RSB- in his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) family, and he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was for two years in his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder.
<p/>And do you know he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) is an Old Believer, or rather a dissenter? I learnt all this from Nikolay and from his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) fellow villagers.
<p/>And what's more, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) wanted to run into the wilderness! He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was full of fervour, prayed at night, read the old books, `the true' ones, and read himself crazy.
<p/>-LSB-*-RSB- A religious sect.--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE. '' Petersburg had a great effect upon him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>), especially the women and the wine. He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) responds to everything and he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) forgot the elder and all that.
<p/>I learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>), and used to go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>), and now this business came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>).
<p/>'' Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was frightened, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) tried to hang himself! He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) ran away! How can one get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings?
<p/>The very word `trial' frightens some of them. Whose fault is it? We shall see what the new juries will do.
<p/>God grant they do good! Well, in prison, it seems, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too, made its appearance again.
<p/>Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, the force of the word `suffering' among some of these people! It's not a question of suffering for someone's benefit, but simply, `one must suffer.'
<p/>In my time there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison always reading his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) Bible on the stove at night
<p/>If they suffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better. and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) read himself crazy, and so crazy, do you know,
<p/>that one day, apropos of nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) seized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had done him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) no harm.
<p/>And the way he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side on purpose, for fear of hurting him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>Well, we know what happens to a prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon. So `he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) suffering.' ''
<p/>So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) suffering or something of the sort. I know it for certain from facts, indeed.
<p/>Only he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) doesn't know that I know. What, you don't admit that there are such fantastic people among the peasants? Lots of them.
<p/>The elder now has begun influencing him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), especially since he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) tried to hang himself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)'ll come and tell me all himself.
<p/>You think he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)'ll hold out? Wait a bit, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)'ll take his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) words back. I am waiting from hour to hour for him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) to come and abjure his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) evidence.
<p/>I have come to like that Nikolay and am studying him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) in detail. And what do you think? He-he! He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) answered me very plausibly on some points, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) obviously had collected some evidence and prepared himself cleverly.
<p/>But on other points he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) is simply at sea, knows nothing and doesn't even suspect that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) doesn't know! '' No, Rodion Romanovitch, Nikolay doesn't come in!
<p/>This is a fantastic, gloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart of man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood `renews,' when comfort is preached as the aim of life.
<p/>Here we see resolution in the first stage, but resolution of a special kind: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolved to do it like jumping over a precipice or from a bell tower and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs shook as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to the crime.
<p/>Here we have bookish dreams, a heart unhinged by theories. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forgot to shut the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and murdered two people for a theory.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) committed the murder and couldn't take the money, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did manage to snatch up he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hid under a stone.
<p/>It wasn't enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and rung the bell, no, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to recall the bell-ringing, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to feel the cold shiver over again....
<p/>Well, that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others, poses as injured innocence.
<p/>No, that's not the work of a Nikolay, my dear Rodion Romanovitch! '' All that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that these words were too great a shock.
<p/>Raskolnikov shuddered as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been stabbed. '' Then... who then... is the murderer? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) asked in a breathless voice, unable to restrain himself.
<p/>Porfiry Petrovitch sank back in his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) chair, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) were amazed at the question. '' Who is the murderer? ''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) repeated, as though unable to believe his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) ears. '' Why, you , Rodion Romanovitch! You are the murderer,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) added, almost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction.
<p/>Raskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a few seconds and sat down again without uttering a word. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face twitched convulsively.
<p/>'' Your lip is twitching just as it did before,'' Porfiry Petrovitch observed almost sympathetically. '' You've been misunderstanding me, I think, Rodion Romanovitch,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added after a brief pause, <div class="bookquote">``that's why you are so surprised.
<p/>I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal openly with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' It was not I murdered her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),'' Raskolnikov whispered like a frightened child caught in the act.
<p/>'' No, it was you, you Rodion Romanovitch, and no one else,'' Porfiry whispered sternly, with conviction. They were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long, about ten minutes.
<p/>Raskolnikov put his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) elbow on the table and passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fingers through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hair. Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting. Suddenly Raskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry.
<p/>'' You are at your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch! Your old method again. I wonder you don't get sick of it!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, stop that, what does that matter now? It would be a different matter if there were witnesses present, but we are whispering alone.
<p/>You see yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare. Whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself, I am convinced without it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' If so, what did you come for? '' Raskolnikov asked irritably. '' I ask you the same question again: if you consider me guilty, why don't you take me to prison?''
<p/>'' Oh, that's your question! I will answer you, point for point. In the first place, to arrest you so directly is not to my interest.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How so? If you are convinced you ought... ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ach, what if I am convinced? That's only my dream for the time.
<p/>Why should I put you in safety? You know that's it, since you ask me to do it. If I confront you with that workman for instance
<p/>and you say to him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) `were you drunk or not? Who saw me with you? I simply took you to be drunk, and you were drunk, too.'
<p/>Well, what could I answer, especially as your story is a more likely one than his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)? for there's nothing but psychology to support his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) evidence
<p/>--that's almost unseemly with his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) ugly mug, while you hit the mark exactly, for the rascal is an inveterate drunkard and
<p/>And I have myself admitted candidly several times already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the second way is stronger and looks far more probable, and that apart from that I have as yet nothing against you.
<p/>And though I shall put you in prison and indeed have come--quite contrary to etiquette--to inform you of it beforehand, yet I tell you frankly, also contrary to etiquette, that it won't be to my advantage.
<p/>notoriously so. Well, secondly, I've come to you because...''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, secondly? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov was listening breathless. '' Because, as I told you just now, I consider I owe you an explanation.
<p/>I don't want you to look upon me as a monster, as I have a genuine liking for you, you may believe me or not.
<p/>And in the third place I've come to you with a direct and open proposition--that you should surrender and confess. It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my advantage too, for my task will be done.
<p/>Well, is this open on my part or not? '' Raskolnikov thought a minute. <div class="bookquote">``Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch. You said just now you have nothing but psychology to go on, yet now you've gone on mathematics.
<p/>Well, what if you are mistaken yourself, now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken. I have a little fact even then, Providence sent it me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What little fact?'' <div class="bookquote">``I won't tell you what, Rodion Romanovitch. And in any case, I haven't the right to put it off any longer, I must arrest you.
<p/>So think it over: it makes no difference to me now and so I speak only for your sake. Believe me, it will be better, Rodion Romanovitch.
<p/>Why, even if I were guilty, which I don't admit, what reason should I have to confess, when you tell me yourself that I shall be in greater safety in prison?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Raskolnikov smiled malignantly. '' That's not simply ridiculous, it's positively shameless. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don't put too much faith in words, perhaps prison will not be altogether a restful place.
<p/>That's only theory and my theory, and what authority am I for you? Perhaps, too, even now I am hiding something from you?
<p/>I can't lay bare everything, he-he! And how can you ask what advantage? Don't you know how it would lessen your sentence?
<p/>You would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case.
<p/>We will make a clean sweep of all these psychological points, of a suspicion against you, so that your crime will appear to have been something like an aberration, for in truth it was an aberration.
<p/>Consider that! I swear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shall come as a complete surprise. I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep my word.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) head sink dejectedly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pondered a long while and at last smiled again, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) smile was sad and gentle.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances with Porfiry, <div class="bookquote">``it's not worth it, I don't care about lessening the sentence!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Porfiry/Porfiry Petrovitch</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No! '' That's just what I was afraid of!'' Porfiry cried warmly and, as it seemed, involuntarily. '' That's just what I feared, that you wouldn't care about the mitigation of sentence.
<p/>'' Raskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' Ah, don't disdain life!'' Porfiry went on. '' You have a great deal of it still before you.
<p/>How can you say you don't want a mitigation of sentence? You are an impatient fellow!'' '' A great deal of what lies before me?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of life. What sort of prophet are you, do you know much about it? Seek and ye shall find. This may be God's means for bringing you to Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>And it's not for ever, the bondage...''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>'' The time will be shortened,'' laughed Raskolnikov. '' Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of?
<p/>It may be that you are afraid of it without knowing it, because you are young! But anyway you shouldn't be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ach, hang it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not want to speak aloud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) got up again as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) meant to go away, but sat down again in evident despair.
<p/>'' Hang it, if you like! You've lost faith and you think that I am grossly flattering you; but how long has your life been?
<p/>You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be not at all original!
<p/>How much do you understand? It turned out something base , that's true, but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base!
<p/>At least you didn't deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the furthest point at one bound. How do I regard you?
<p/>I regard you as one of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he (<font color='blue'><b>torturer</b></font>) cuts their entrails out, if only they have found faith or God.
<p/>Find it and you will live. You have long needed a change of air. Suffering, too, is a good thing. Suffer!
<p/>I know you don't believe in it--but don't be over-wise; fling yourself straight into life, without deliberation; don't be afraid--the flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again.
<p/>Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer. What bank? How can I tell? I only believe that you have long life before you.
<p/>I know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared beforehand, but maybe you will remember them after.
<p/>They may be of use some time. That's why I speak. It's as well that you only killed the old woman.
<p/>If you'd invented another theory you might perhaps have done something a thousand times more hideous. You ought to thank God, perhaps.
<p/>How do you know? Perhaps God is saving you for something. But keep a good heart and have less fear! Are you afraid of the great expiation before you?
<p/>No, it would be shameful to be afraid of it. Since you have taken such a step, you must harden your heart.
<p/>There is justice in it. You must fulfil the demands of justice. I know that you don't believe it, but indeed, life will bring you through.
<p/>You will live it down in time. What you need now is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air!'' Raskolnikov positively started.
<p/>'' But who are you? what prophet are you? From the height of what majestic calm do you proclaim these words of wisdom?''
<p/>'' Who am I? I am a man with nothing to hope for, that's all. A man perhaps of feeling and sympathy, maybe of some knowledge too, but my day is over.
<p/>But you are a different matter, there is life waiting for you. Though, who knows? maybe your life, too, will pass off in smoke and come to nothing.
<p/>Come, what does it matter, that you will pass into another class of men? It's not comfort you regret, with your heart!
<p/>What of it that perhaps no one will see you for so long? It's not time, but yourself that will decide that.
<p/>Be the sun and all will see you. The sun has before all to be the sun. Why are you smiling again?
<p/>At my being such a Schiller? I bet you're imagining that I am trying to get round you by flattery. Well, perhaps I am, he-he-he!
<p/>But let me add, you can judge for yourself, I think, how far I am a base sort of man and how far I am honest.''
<p/>Perhaps you'd better not believe my word, perhaps you'd better never believe it altogether--I'm made that way, I confess it. <div class="bookquote">``When do you mean to arrest me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, I can let you walk about another day or two. Think it over, my dear fellow, and pray to God.
<p/>It's more in your interest, believe me.'' '' And what if I run away?'' asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile. ''
<p/>A peasant would run away, a fashionable dissenter would run away, the flunkey of another man's thought, for you've only to show him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the end of your little finger and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be ready to believe in anything for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.
<p/>No, you won't run away. But you've ceased to believe in your theory already, what will you run away with? And what would you do in hiding?
<p/>It would be hateful and difficult for you, and what you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an atmosphere to suit you.
<p/>And what sort of atmosphere would you have? If you ran away, you'd come back to yourself. You can't get on without us.
<p/>And if I put you in prison--say you've been there a month, or two, or three--remember my word, you'll confess of yourself and perhaps to your own surprise.
<p/>You won't know an hour beforehand that you are coming with a confession. I am convinced that you will decide, `to take your suffering.'
<p/>You don't believe my words now, but you'll come to it of yourself. For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing.
<p/>Never mind my having grown fat, I know all the same. Don't laugh at it, there's an idea in suffering, Nokolay is right.
<p/>No, you won't run away, Rodion Romanovitch. '' Raskolnikov got up and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cap. Porfiry Petrovitch also rose. '' Are you going for a walk?
<p/>The evening will be fine, if only we don't have a storm. Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), too, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cap. '' Porfiry Petrovitch, please don't take up the notion that I have confessed to you to-day,'' Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence.
<p/>'' You're a strange man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity. But I have admitted nothing, remember that!''
<p/>'' Oh, I know that, I'll remember. Look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'s trembling! Don't be uneasy, my dear fellow, have it your own way.
<p/>Walk about a bit, you won't be able to walk too far. If anything happens, I have one request to make of you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) added, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) voice.
<p/>If anything were to happen -LRB-though indeed I don't believe in it and think you quite incapable of it-RRB-, yet in case you were taken during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to the business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion--laying hands on yourself---LRB-it's an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me for it-RRB- do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the stone.
<p/>'' It's an awkward one, but important. It will be more generous. Come, till we meet! Good thoughts and sound decisions to you!''
<p/>The latter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) calculated that Porfiry had reached the street and moved away.
<p/>Porfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) too went hurriedly out of the room. CHAPTER III He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hurried to Svidrigaïlov's.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had to hope from that man he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not know. But that man had some hidden power over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Having once recognised this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not rest, and now the time had come. On the way, one question particularly worried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): had Svidrigaïlov been to Porfiry's?
<p/>As far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) could judge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) would swear to it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) pondered again and again, went over Porfiry's visit; no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) hadn't been, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) hadn't.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) could not have explained, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment.
<p/>But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had not been yet, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) go? Meanwhile, for the present he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) couldn't. Why? It all worried him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) and at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) could not attend to it.
<p/>Strange to say, none would have believed it perhaps, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) only felt a faint vague anxiety about his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) immediate future.
<p/>Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was conscious of immense moral fatigue, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) mind was working better that morning than it had done of late.
<p/>Another, much more important anxiety tormented him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)--it concerned himself, but in a different, more vital way. And was it worth while, after all that had happened, to contend with these new trivial difficulties?
<p/>Was it worth while, for instance, to manoeuvre that Svidrigaïlov should not go to Porfiry's? Was it worth while to investigate, to ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone like Svidrigaïlov?
<p/>Oh, how sick he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was of it all! And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was hastening to Svidrigaïlov; could he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) be expecting something new from him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), information, or means of escape?
<p/>Men will catch at straws! Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together? Perhaps it was only fatigue, despair; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlov
<p/>but some other whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) needed, and Svidrigaïlov had simply presented himself by chance. Sonia? But what should he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) go to Sonia for now?
<p/>To beg her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) tears again? He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was afraid of Sonia, too. Sonia stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) as an irrevocable sentence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) must go his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) own way or hers.
<p/>At that moment especially he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) did not feel equal to seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). No, would it not be better to try Svidrigaïlov?
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) could not help inwardly owning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had long felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) must see him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) for some reason. But what could they have in common?
<p/>Their very evil-doing could not be of the same kind. The man, moreover, was very unpleasant, evidently depraved, undoubtedly cunning and deceitful, possibly malignant.
<p/>Such stories were told about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It is true he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was befriending Katerina Ivanovna's children, but who could tell with what motive and what it meant?
<p/>The man always had some design, some project. There was another thought which had been continually hovering of late about Raskolnikov's mind, and causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) great uneasiness.
<p/>It was so painful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) made distinct efforts to get rid of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sometimes thought that Svidrigaïlov was dogging his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) footsteps.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov had found out his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) secret and had had designs on Dounia. What if he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had them still? Wasn't it practically certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had?
<p/>And what if, having learnt his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) secret and so having gained power over him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) were to use it as a weapon against Dounia?
<p/>This idea sometimes even tormented his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) dreams, but it had never presented itself so vividly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) as on his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) way to Svidrigaïlov.
<p/>To begin with, this would transform everything, even his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) own position; he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) would have at once to confess his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) secret to Dounia.
<p/>The very thought moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) to gloomy rage. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) have to give himself up perhaps to prevent Dounia from taking some rash step?
<p/>The letter? This morning Dounia had received a letter. From whom could she (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) get letters in Petersburg? Luzhin, perhaps? It's true
<p/>Razumihin was there to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), but Razumihin knew nothing of the position. Perhaps it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) duty to tell Razumihin?
<p/>Thank God, the details of the interview were of little consequence, if only he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) could get at the root of the matter; but if Svidrigaïlov were capable... if he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) were intriguing against Dounia--then...
<p/>Raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had passed through that month that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) could only decide such questions in one way; <div class="bookquote">``then I shall kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) thought in cold despair.
<p/>A sudden anguish oppressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) stood still in the middle of the street and began looking about to see where he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was and which way he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was going.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) thought of it with repugnance. In any case he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) must see Svidrigaïlov as soon as possible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) decided finally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) found himself in X. Prospect, thirty or forty paces from the Hay Market, through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) had come.
<p/>The whole second storey of the house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide open; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were full to overflowing.
<p/>There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and violin, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) could hear women shrieking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) was about to turn back wondering why he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) had come to the X. Prospect, when suddenly at one of the end windows he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) saw Svidrigaïlov, sitting at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov was silently watching and scrutinising him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) and, what struck Raskolnikov at once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.
<p/>Raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), but to be looking absent-mindedly away, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) out of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eye.
<p/>Raskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback, almost terrified. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart was beating violently. Yet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlov did not want to be seen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) took the pipe out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) mouth and was on the point of concealing himself, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) got up and moved back his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), and was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>What had passed between them was much the same as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov's room. A sly smile came into Svidrigaïlov's face and grew broader and broader.
<p/>Each knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was seen and watched by the other. At last Svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh. '' Well, well, come in
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) found Svidrigaïlov in a tiny back room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbers of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the desperate bawling of a chorus of singers.
<p/>if you want me; I am here!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) shouted from the window. Raskolnikov went up into the tavern. The click of billiard balls could be heard in the distance.
<p/>In the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) found also a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl of eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with ribbons.
<p/>In spite of the chorus in the other room, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was singing some servants' hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of the organ.
<p/>On the table before Svidrigaïlov stood an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. '' Come, that's enough,'' Svidrigaïlov stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at Raskolnikov's entrance.
<p/>The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had sung her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' Hey, Philip, a glass!'' shouted Svidrigaïlov. '' I won't drink anything,'' said Raskolnikov. '' As you like, I didn't mean it for you.
<p/>Drink, Katia! I don't want anything more to-day, you can go. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) poured her (<font color='blue'><b>Katia</b></font>) out a full glass, and laid down a yellow note.
<p/>Katia drank off her (<font color='blue'><b>Katia</b></font>) glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down, in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov's hand, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) allowed quite seriously.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katia</b></font>) went out of the room and the boy trailed after her (<font color='blue'><b>Katia</b></font>) with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, Philip, was by now an old friend and very obsequious.
<p/>The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidrigaïlov was at home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it.
<p/>I was going to see you and looking for you,'' Raskolnikov began, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X. Prospect just now.
<p/>The tavern was dirty and wretched, not even second-rate. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>I never take this turning. I turn to the right from the Hay Market.
<p/>And this isn't the way to you. I simply turned and here you are. It is strange!'' <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you say at once `it's a miracle'?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Because it may be only chance.'' '' Oh, that's the way with all you folk,'' laughed Svidrigaïlov. '' You won't admit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle!
<p/>Here you say that it may be only chance. And what cowards they all are here, about having an opinion of their own, you can't fancy, Rodion Romanovitch.
<p/>I don't mean you, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to have it. That's how it was you attracted my curiosity.
<p/>Well, that's enough, you know,'' Svidrigaïlov was obviously exhilarated, but only slightly so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had not had more than half a glass of wine.
<p/>I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of having what you call an opinion of my own,'' observed Raskolnikov.
<p/>And apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep for the last two or three days.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Nothing else?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Oh, well, it was a different matter. Everyone has his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own plans. I told you of this tavern myself, there is no miracle in your coming straight here.
<p/>I explained the way myself, told you where it was, and the hours you could find me here. Do you remember?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>answered Raskolnikov with surprise. '' I believe you. I told you twice. The address has been stamped mechanically on your memory.
<p/>You turned this way mechanically and yet precisely according to the direction, though you are not aware of it. When I told you then, I hardly hoped you understood me.
<p/>You give yourself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch. And another thing, I'm convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves as they walk.
<p/>If only we had scientific men, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable investigations in Petersburg each in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own line.
<p/>There are few places where there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul of man as in Petersburg.
<p/>This is a town of crazy people. The mere influences of climate mean so much. And it's the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must be reflected on the whole country.
<p/>You walk out of your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it sink, and fold your hands behind your back.
<p/>But that is neither here nor there now. The point is that I have several times watched you. You look and evidently see nothing before nor beside you.
<p/>At last you begin moving your lips and talking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at last stand still in the middle of the road.
<p/>That's not at all the thing. Someone may be watching you besides me, and it won't do you any good. It's nothing really to do with me
<p/>and I can't cure you, but, of course, you understand me.'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you know that I am being followed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>asked Raskolnikov, looking inquisitively at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>'' No, I know nothing about it,'' said Svidrigaïlov, seeming surprised. '' Well, then, let us leave me alone,'' Raskolnikov muttered, frowning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and directed me twice to come here to you, why did you hide, and try to get away just now when I looked at the window from the street?
<p/>you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and pretended to be asleep, though you were wide awake while I stood in your doorway?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Very good, let us leave you alone. '' I saw it.'' '' He-he! And why was it I saw it.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I may have had... reasons. You know that yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And I may have had my reasons, though you don't know them.
<p/>Raskolnikov dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) right elbow on the table, leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) chin in the fingers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) right hand, and stared intently at Svidrigaïlov.
<p/>It was a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips, with a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair.
<p/>'' For a full minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) scrutinised his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face, which had impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) before. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes were somehow too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed.
<p/>There was something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so wonderfully young for his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) age. Svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) linen.
<p/>Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?'' said Raskolnikov suddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point.
<p/>Even though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me, I don't want to put myself out any more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a huge ring with a precious stone in it. '' '' I will show you at once that I don't prize myself as you probably think I do.
<p/>I've come to tell you at once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has been discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up.
<p/>And in the second place if you want to tell me anything--for I keep fancying all this time that you have something to tell me--make haste and tell it, for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late.
<p/>You can reckon on my word. You know that I can keep it. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why in such haste?''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>asked Svidrigaïlov, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) curiously.
<p/>You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the first question you refuse to answer,'' Svidrigaïlov observed with a smile.
<p/>'' Everyone has his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) plans,'' Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently. '' '' You keep fancying that I have aims of my own
<p/>and so you look at me with suspicion. Of course it's perfectly natural in your position. But though I should like to be friends with you, I shan't trouble myself to convince you of the contrary.
<p/>The game isn't worth the candle and I wasn't intending to talk to you about anything special. '' '' What did you want me, for, then?
<p/>It was you who came hanging about me.'' '' Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I liked the fantastic nature of your position--that's what it was!
<p/>Besides you are the brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person I had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which I gathered that you had a great influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); isn't that enough?
<p/>Here, you, for instance, have come to me not only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something new.
<p/>Ha-ha-ha! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and is difficult for me to answer. Isn't that so?
<p/>Well, can't you fancy then that I, too, on my way here in the train was reckoning on you, on your telling me something new, and on my making some profit out of you!
<p/>Isn't that so? '' persisted Svidrigaïlov with a sly smile. '' You see what rich men we are!'' '' What profit could you make?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what a tavern I spend all my time and it's my enjoyment
<p/>, that's to say it's no great enjoyment, but one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now--you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Katia</b></font>)?... If only I had been a glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a terrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Have you dined, by the way? I've had something and want nothing more. I don't drink, for instance, at all.

<p/>I ordered it just now to wind myself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a peculiar state of mind.
<p/>That was why I hid myself just now like a schoolboy, for I was afraid you would hinder me. But I believe,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) watch, <div class="bookquote">``I can spend an hour with you.

<p/>'' What of it? You seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?'' <div class="bookquote">``You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Vice! Oh, that's what you are after! But I'll answer you in order, first about women in general; you know I am fond of talking.
<p/>Tell me, what should I restrain myself for? Why should I give up women, since I have a passion for them?
<p/>It's an occupation, anyway.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' So you hope for nothing here but vice?'' '' Oh, very well, for vice then. You insist on its being vice.
<p/>In this vice at least there is something permanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy, something present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever setting one on fire
<p/>But anyway I like a direct question. and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even with years. You'll agree it's an occupation of a sort.
<p/>'' '' That's nothing to rejoice at, it's a disease and a dangerous one.'' '' Oh, that's what you think, is it!
<p/>I agree, that it is a disease like everything that exceeds moderation. And, of course, in this one must exceed moderation.
<p/>But in the first place, everybody does so in one way or another, and in the second place, of course, one ought to be moderate and prudent,
<p/>however mean it may be, but what am I to do? If I hadn't this, I might have to shoot myself.
<p/>I am ready to admit that a decent man ought to put up with being bored, but yet...'' '' And could you shoot yourself?''
<p/>Please don't speak of it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had shown in all the previous conversation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>Svidrigaïlov parried with disgust. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) face quite changed. '' I admit it's an unpardonable weakness, but I can't help it.

<p/>I should have found plenty to tell you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>'' What's your engagement, a woman?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, a woman, a casual incident....
<p/>No, that's not what I want to talk of.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn't that affect you?
<p/>Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?'' '' And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he! You surprised me just now, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew beforehand it would be so.
<p/>Of course that's all as it should be and it would be surprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality....
<p/>You preach to me about vice and æsthetics! You--a Schiller, you--an idealist! Ah, what a pity I have no time, for you're a most interesting type!
<p/>And, by-the-way, are you fond of Schiller? I am awfully fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>).'' '' But what a braggart you are,'' Raskolnikov said with some disgust.
<p/>'' Upon my word, I am not,'' answered Svidrigaïlov laughing. '' However, I won't dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no one?
<p/>I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when I come across an intelligent person like you--intelligent and highly interesting--I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I've drunk that half-glass of champagne
<p/>and it's gone to my head a little. And besides, there's a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about that I... will keep quiet.
<p/>Where are you off to? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked in alarm. Raskolnikov had begun getting up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt oppressed and stifled and, as it were, ill at ease at having come here.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt convinced that Svidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth. '' A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!''
<p/>Svidrigaïlov begged. '' Let them bring you some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won't talk nonsense, about myself, I mean.
<p/>I'll tell you something. If you like I'll tell you how a woman tried `to save' me, as you would call it?
<p/>It will be an answer to your first question indeed, for the woman was your sister. May I tell you? It will help to spend the time.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, but I trust that you...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't be uneasy. Besides, even in a worthless low fellow like me, Avdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect.
<p/>You know perhaps--yes, I told you myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>began Svidrigaïlov, <div class="bookquote">``that I was in the debtors' prison here, for an immense sum, and had not any expectation of being able to pay it.
<p/>There's no need to go into particulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a point of insanity a woman can sometimes love?
<p/>Would you believe that this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics and reproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kept throughout our married life?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER IV '' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was an honest woman, and very sensible, although completely uneducated. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was considerably older than I, and besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) always kept a clove or something in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>There was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) straight out that I couldn't be absolutely faithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought it showed I was unwilling to deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if I warned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) like this beforehand and for a jealous woman, you know, that's the first consideration.
<p/>This confession drove her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to frenzy, but yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seems in a way to have liked my brutal frankness. After many tears an unwritten contract was drawn up between us:
<p/>first, that I would never leave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband; secondly, that I would never absent myself without her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) permission; thirdly, that I would never set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, Marfa Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) secret knowledge; fifthly, God forbid my falling in love with a woman of our class; sixthly, in case I--which God forbid--should be visited by a great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a sensible woman and so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not help looking upon me as a dissolute profligate incapable of real love.
<p/>On this last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease. But a sensible woman and a jealous woman are two very different things, and that's where the trouble came in.
<p/>But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people about us.
<p/>I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than in anyone's. Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was ridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) certainly had some very ridiculous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the innumerable woes of which I was the cause.
<p/>Well, and that's enough, I think, by way of a decorous oraison funèbre for the most tender wife of a most tender husband.
<p/>When we quarrelled, I usually held my tongue and did not irritate her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to attain its object, it influenced her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), indeed.
<p/>These were times when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was positively proud of me. But your sister she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) couldn't put up with, anyway. And however she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came to risk taking such a beautiful creature into her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) house as a governess.
<p/>My explanation is that Marfa Petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell in love herself--literally fell in love--with your sister.
<p/>I saw the danger at the first glance and what do you think, I resolved not to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) even.
<p/>Would you believe it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first for my persistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna.
<p/>Well, little wonder--look at Avdotya Romanovna! But Avdotya Romanovna herself made the first step, would you believe it? I don't know what it was she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wanted!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had the unfortunate habit of telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually complaining of me; how could she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) fail to confide in such a delightful new friend?
<p/>I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt Avdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were current about me....
<p/>Well, of course, Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya Romanovna every detail about me. I don't mind betting that you too have heard something of the sort already?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have. Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child. Is that true?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't refer to those vulgar tales, I beg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>said Svidrigaïlov with disgust and annoyance.
<p/>'' If you insist on wanting to know about all that idiocy, I will tell you one day, but now...'' <div class="bookquote">``I was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you treated badly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg you to drop the subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>Svidrigaïlov interrupted again with obvious impatience. '' Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?...
<p/>you told me about it yourself.'' Raskolnikov felt more and more irritated. Svidrigaïlov looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) caught a flash of spiteful mockery in that look.
<p/>I see that you, too, are extremely interested and shall feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity.
<p/>But Svidrigaïlov restrained himself and answered very civilly: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was. Upon my soul! I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure with some people.
<p/>Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip about me.
<p/>With all Avdotya Romanovna's natural aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect--she (<font color='blue'><b>Romanovna</b></font>) did at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul.
<p/>I dare not guess what impression it made on her (<font color='blue'><b>Romanovna</b></font>), but in any case it worked in my interests. And if once a girl's heart is moved to pity , it's more dangerous than anything.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is bound to want to `save him (<font color='blue'><b>Romanovna</b></font>),' to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Romanovna</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Romanovna</b></font>) senses, and lift him (<font color='blue'><b>Romanovna</b></font>) up and draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Romanovna</b></font>) to nobler aims, and restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Romanovna</b></font>) to new life and usefulness--well, we all know how far such dreams can go.
<p/>I saw at once that the bird was flying into the cage of herself. And I too made ready. I think you are frowning, Rodion Romanovitch?
<p/>Do you know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that it wasn't your sister's fate to be born in the second or third century A.D., as the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia Minor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bosom with hot pincers.
<p/>There's no need. As you know, it all ended in smoke. -LRB-Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking!-RRB- And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would have gone to it of herself.
<p/>And in the fourth or fifth century she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and visions.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) can't get her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) torture, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'ll throw herself out of a window.
<p/>I've heard something of a Mr. Razumihin--he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'s said to be a sensible fellow; his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) surname suggests it, indeed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'s probably a divinity student.
<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'d better look after your sister! I believe I understand her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and I am proud of it. But at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one is apt to be more heedless and stupid.
<p/>One doesn't see clearly. Hang it all, why is she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so handsome? It's not my fault. In fact, it began on my side with a most irresistible physical desire.
<p/>Avdotya Romanovna is awfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so. Take note, I tell you this about your sister as a fact.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is almost morbidly chaste, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) broad intelligence, and it will stand in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) way. There happened to be a girl in the house then
<p/>, Parasha, a black-eyed wench, whom I had never seen before--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had just come from another village--very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) burst into tears, wailed so that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.
<p/>One day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in the garden and with flashing eyes insisted on my leaving poor Parasha alone.
<p/>I, of course, was only too pleased to obey her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wishes, tried to appear disconcerted, embarrassed, in fact played my part not badly.
<p/>It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. Then came interviews, mysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even tears--would you believe it, even tears?
<p/>I, of course, threw it all on my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the female heart, a weapon which never fails one.
<p/>Think what the passion for propaganda will bring some girls to! It's the well-known resource--flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery.
<p/>If there's the hundredth part of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that leads to trouble.
<p/>But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction.
<p/>It may be a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true.
<p/>I can never remember without laughter how I once seduced a lady who was devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) children, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) principles.
<p/>That's so for all stages of development and classes of society. A vestal virgin might be seduced by flattery. What fun it was and how little trouble!
<p/>And the lady really had principles--of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply being utterly annihilated and prostrate before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) purity.
<p/>I flattered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of the hand, even a glance from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), I would reproach myself for having snatched it by force, and would declare that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had resisted, so that I could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.
<p/>I maintained that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so innocent that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not foresee my treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on.
<p/>In fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was innocent, chaste, and faithful to all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) duties and obligations and had succumbed quite by accident.
<p/>And how angry she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was with me when I explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at last that it was my sincere conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was just as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of flattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) property settled on me during her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lifetime.
<p/>I hope you won't be angry if I mention now that I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.
<p/>-LRB-I am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talking too much.-RRB- But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all.
<p/>Avdotya Romanovna had several times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by the expression of my eyes, would you believe it?
<p/>There was sometimes a light in them which frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and grew stronger and stronger and more unguarded till it was hateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>I fell to jeering in the coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha came on to the scene again, and not she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) alone; in fact there was a tremendous to-do.
<p/>No need to go into detail, but we parted. There I acted stupidly again. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your sister's eyes can flash sometimes!
<p/>Never mind my being drunk at this moment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth.
<p/>I assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) dress was more than I could stand at last.
<p/>I really began to think that I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I could be moved to such a frenzy.
<p/>It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled, but by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To what a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy!
<p/>Never undertake anything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya Romanovna was after all a beggar -LRB-ach, excuse me,
<p/>but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?-RRB-, that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) lived by her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) work, that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mother and you to keep -LRB-ach, hang it, you are frowning again-RRB-, and I resolved to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) all my money--thirty thousand roubles I could have realised then--if she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) would run away with me here, to Petersburg.
<p/>Do you know, I was so wild about her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) at that time that if she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) throat and to marry herself, it would have been done at once!
<p/>that's not the word... Of course I should have vowed eternal love, rapture, and so on. But it ended in the catastrophe of which you know already.
<p/>You can fancy how frantic I was when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly attorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which would really have been just the same thing as I was proposing.
<p/>Wouldn't it? Wouldn't it? I notice that you've begun to be very attentive... you interesting young man... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>Svidrigaïlov struck the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) fist impatiently.
<p/>Raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) resolved to take advantage of the opportunity.
<p/>Well, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that you have come to Petersburg with designs on my sister,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said directly to Svidrigaïlov, in order to irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) further.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was flushed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov. '' '' Oh, nonsense,'' said Svidrigaïlov, seeming to rouse himself. '' Why, I told you... besides your sister can't endure me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) can't, but that's not the point.

<p/>Afraid of you? You have rather to be afraid of me, cher ami . But what nonsense.... I've drunk too much though, I see that.
<p/>I was almost saying too much again. Damn the wine! Hi! there, water!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of the window.
<p/>Philip brought the water. '' That's all nonsense!'' said Svidrigaïlov, wetting a towel and putting it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) head. '' But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all your suspicions.
<p/>But I couldn't have told you so for certain for I had not even seen my betrothed; I only meant to.
<p/>But now I really have a betrothed and it's a settled thing, and if it weren't that I have business that can't be put off, I would have taken you to see them at once, for I should like to ask your advice.

<p/>Come, are you listening? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arranged it all for me. You're bored, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, you want something to fill up your time.
<p/>For, you know, I am a gloomy, depressed person. Do you think I'm light-hearted? No, I'm gloomy. I do no harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a time.

<p/>There is a son serving in the provinces, but he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) doesn't help; there is a daughter, who is married, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) doesn't visit them.
<p/>And they've two little nephews on their hands, as though their own children were not enough, and they've taken from school their youngest daughter, a girl who'll be sixteen in another month, so that then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can be married.
<p/>And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you. The mamma, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, was a sensible woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was for me.
<p/>We went there. How funny it was! I present myself--a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections, with a fortune.
<p/>What if I am fifty and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not sixteen? Who thinks of that? But it's fascinating, isn't it? It is fascinating, ha-ha!
<p/>You should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. It was worth paying to have seen me at that moment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comes in, curtseys, you can fancy, still in a short frock--an unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been told, no doubt.
<p/>I don't know how you feel about female faces, but to my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is a perfect little picture, too.
<p/>Fair hair in little curls, like a lamb's, full little rosy lips, tiny feet, a charmer! ... Well, we made friends.
<p/>I told them I was in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is the day before yesterday, we were betrothed.
<p/>When I go now I take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on my knee at once and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) there.... Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flushes like a sunset
<p/>and I kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) every minute. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mamma of course impresses on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that this is her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband and that this must be so.
<p/>It's simply delicious! The present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here you have what is called la nature et la vérité , ha-ha!
<p/>I've talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) twice, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is far from a fool. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) steals a look at me that positively scorches me.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face is like Raphael's Madonna. You know, the Sistine Madonna's face has something fantastic in it, the face of mournful religious ecstasy.
<p/>The day after we'd been betrothed, I bought her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles--a set of diamonds and another of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with all sorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna's face glowed.
<p/>I sat her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) on my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rather too unceremoniously--she (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) flushed crimson and the tears started, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) didn't want to show it.
<p/>We were left alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) suddenly flung herself on my neck -LRB-for the first time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) own accord-RRB-, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) little arms round me, kissed me, and vowed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would make me happy, would devote all her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) life, every minute of her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) life, would sacrifice everything, everything, and that all she (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) asks in return is my respect , and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) wants `nothing, nothing more from me, no presents.'
<p/>You'll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from an angel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a flush of maiden shyness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) eyes is rather fascinating!
<p/>Haven't you noticed it? Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>)'s something in that line. Isn't it fascinating? It's worth paying for, isn't it? Well... listen, we'll go to see my betrothed, only not just now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites your sensuality! Will you really make such a marriage?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course. Everyone thinks of himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) lives most gaily who knows best how to deceive himself. Ha-ha! But why are you so keen about virtue?
<p/>Have mercy on me, my good friend. I am a sinful man. Ha-ha-ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>'' But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna.
<p/>Though... though you had your own reasons.... I understand it all now. '' <div class="bookquote">``I am always fond of children, very fond of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>laughed Svidrigaïlov.
<p/>'' I can tell you one curious instance of it. The first day I came here I visited various haunts, after seven years I simply rushed at them.
<p/>You probably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my old friends. I shall do without them as long as I can.
<p/>Do you know, when I was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted by the thought of these places where anyone who knows his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) way about can find a great deal.
<p/>The peasants have vodka, the educated young people, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams and visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery.
<p/>Yes, upon my soul! From the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours. I chanced to be in a frightful den--
<p/>I like my dens dirty --it was a dance, so called, and there was a cancan such as I never saw in my day.
<p/>All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely dressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one vis-à-vis .
<p/>Yes, there you have progress. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother was sitting on a chair by the wall. You can't fancy what a cancan that was!
<p/>The girl was ashamed, blushed, at last felt insulted, and began to cry. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) partner seized her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and began whirling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) round and performing before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); everyone laughed and--
<p/>I like your public, even the cancan public--they laughed and shouted, `Serves her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) right--serves her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) right! Shouldn't bring children!' Well, it's not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or not.
<p/>I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and began by saying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and that they couldn't distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to understand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them home in my carriage.
<p/>I took them home and got to know them. They were lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the country.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told me that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter could only regard my acquaintance as an honour. I found out that they had nothing of their own and had come to town upon some legal business.
<p/>I proffered my services and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon by mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class.
<p/>I offered to assist in the young girl's education in French and dancing. My offer was accepted with enthusiasm as an honour--and we are still friendly....
<p/>If you like, we'll go and see them, only not just now.'' <div class="bookquote">``Stop! Enough of your vile, nasty anecdotes, depraved vile, sensual man!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Schiller, you are a regular Schiller! O la vertu va-t-elle se nicher? But you know I shall tell you these things on purpose, for the pleasure of hearing your outcries!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say. I can see I am ridiculous myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>muttered Raskolnikov angrily. Svidrigaïlov laughed heartily; finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) called Philip, paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) bill, and began getting up.
<p/>'' I say, but I am drunk, assez causé ,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said. '' It's been a pleasure. '' <div class="bookquote">``I should rather think it must be a pleasure!
<p/>No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to describe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind--especially under such circumstances and to such a man as me....
<p/>Well, if you come to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>Svidrigaïlov answered, scrutinising Raskolnikov with some surprise, <div class="bookquote">``if you come to that, you are a thorough cynic yourself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>cried Raskolnikov, getting up. '' It's stimulating!'' '' You've plenty to make you so, anyway. You can understand a great deal... and you can do a great deal too.
<p/>But enough. I sincerely regret not having had more talk with you, but I shan't lose sight of you.... Only wait a bit.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk, the wine had affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) for a moment, but it was passing off every minute.
<p/>'' Svidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant. Raskolnikov walked out after him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was preoccupied with something of importance and was frowning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was apparently excited and uneasy in anticipation of something. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) manner to Raskolnikov had changed during the last few minutes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was ruder and more sneering every moment.
<p/>Raskolnikov noticed all this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) too was uneasy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) became very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). They came out on to the pavement.
<p/>'' You go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the other way. Only adieu, mon plaisir , may we meet again.
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walked to the right towards the Hay Market. CHAPTER V Raskolnikov walked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' What's this? '' cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, <div class="bookquote">``I thought I said...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Both stood still and gazed at one another, as though measuring their strength.
<p/>From all your half tipsy stories,'' Raskolnikov observed harshly, <div class="bookquote">``I am positive that you have not given up your designs on my sister, but are pursuing them more actively than ever.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>I have learnt that my sister received a letter this morning. You have hardly been able to sit still all this time....
<p/>You may have unearthed a wife on the way, but that means nothing. I should like to make certain myself. ''
<p/>Raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wanted and of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wished to make certain. '' Upon my word!
<p/>I'll call the police!'' <div class="bookquote">``Call away!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Again they stood for a minute facing each other. At last Svidrigaïlov's face changed. Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not frightened at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) threat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) assumed a mirthful and friendly air.
<p/>'' What a fellow! I purposely refrained from referring to your affair, though I am devoured by curiosity. It's a fantastic affair.
<p/>I've put it off till another time, but you're enough to rouse the dead.... Well, let us go , only I warn you beforehand
<p/>I am only going home for a moment, to get some money; then I shall lock up the flat, take a cab and go to spend the evening at the Islands.
<p/>I'm coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna, to say I'm sorry not to have been at the funeral.
<p/>Now, now are you going to follow me?'' '' '' '' That's as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Semyonovna</b></font>) has taken the three children to an old lady of high rank, the patroness of some orphan asylums, whom I used to know years ago.
<p/>I charmed the old lady by depositing a sum of money with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to provide for the three children of Katerina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well.
<p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) too the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing nothing. It produced an indescribable effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>That's why Sofya Semyonovna has been invited to call to-day at the X. Hotel where the lady is staying for the time.''
<p/>'' No matter, I'll come all the same. '' '' As you like, it's nothing to me, but I won't come with you; here we are at home.
<p/>By the way, I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion just because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled you with questions...
<p/>you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I don't mind betting it's that. Well, it teaches one to show delicacy!'' ''
<p/>And to listen at doors!'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's it, is it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>laughed Svidrigaïlov. '' Yes, I should have been surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened.
<p/>Though I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and were telling Sofya Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it?
<p/>Ha-ha! Perhaps I am quite behind the times and can't understand. For goodness' sake, explain it, my dear boy. Expound the latest theories!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't have heard anything. You're making it all up!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' But I'm not talking about that -LRB-though I did hear something-RRB-.
<p/>No, I'm talking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now. The Schiller in you is in revolt every moment, and now you tell me not to listen at doors.
<p/>If that's how you feel, go and inform the police that you had this mischance: you made a little mistake in your theory.
<p/>But if you are convinced that one mustn't listen at doors, but one may murder old women at one's pleasure, you'd better be off to America and make haste.
<p/>Run, young man! There may still be time. I'm speaking sincerely. Haven't you the money? I'll give you the fare.'' ''
<p/>I'm not thinking of that at all,'' Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust. '' I understand -LRB-but don't put yourself out, don't discuss it if you don't want to-RRB-.
<p/>I understand the questions you are worrying over--moral ones, aren't they? Duties of citizen and man? Lay them all aside. They are nothing to you now, ha-ha!
<p/>You'll say you are still a man and a citizen. If so you ought not to have got into this coil.
<p/>It's no use taking up a job you are not fit for. Well, you'd better shoot yourself, or don't you want to?''
<p/>'' You seem trying to enrage me, to make me leave you.'' <div class="bookquote">``What a queer fellow! But here we are. Welcome to the staircase.
<p/>You see, that's the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look, there is no one at home. Don't you believe me? Ask Kapernaumov.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) leaves the key with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). Here is Madame de Kapernaumov herself. Hey, what? She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is rather deaf. Has she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gone out?
<p/>Where? Did you hear? She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is not in and won't be till late in the evening probably. Well, come to my room; you wanted to come and see me, didn't you?
<p/>Here we are. Madame Resslich's not at home. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is a woman who is always busy, an excellent woman I assure you....
<p/>I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau--see what a lot I've got of them still--this one will be turned into cash to-day.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) might have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible. Now, see! I mustn't waste any more time.
<p/>The bureau is locked, the flat is locked, and here we are again on the stairs. Shall we take a cab?
<p/>I'm going to the Islands. Would you like a lift? I'll take this carriage. Ah, you refuse? You are tired of it!
<p/>Come for a drive! I believe it will come on to rain. Never mind, we'll put down the hood... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>Svidrigaïlov was already in the carriage.
<p/>Raskolnikov decided that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) suspicions were at least for that moment unjust. Without answering a word he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned and walked back towards the Hay Market.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) had only turned round on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) way he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not a hundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement.
<p/>To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that coarse brute, that depraved sensualist and blackguard!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) cried.
<p/>Raskolnikov's judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was something about Svidrigaïlov which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) a certain original, even a mysterious character.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had turned the corner and could see nothing. Intense disgust drew him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) away from Svidrigaïlov. '' As concerned his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) sister, Raskolnikov was convinced that Svidrigaïlov would not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in peace.
<p/>But it was too tiresome and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had not gone twenty paces before he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) sank, as usual, into deep thought.
<p/>On the bridge he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) stood by the railing and began gazing at the water. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) sister was standing close by him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Dounia had never met him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) like this in the street before and was struck with dismay.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) stood still and did not know whether to call to him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) or not. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the direction of the Hay Market.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) did not go on to the bridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing all he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) could to avoid Raskolnikov's seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) seemed to be approaching cautiously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had observed Dounia for some time and had been making signs to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was signalling to beg her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) not to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother, but to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>That was what Dounia did. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) stole by her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother and went up to Svidrigaïlov. '' Let us make haste away,'' Svidrigaïlov whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I don't want Rodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting.
<p/>I must tell you I've been sitting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) in the restaurant close by, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) looked me up and I had great difficulty in getting rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) has somehow heard of my letter to you and suspects something. It wasn't you who told him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), of course, but
<p/>if not you, who then?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>'' Well, we've turned the corner now,'' Dounia interrupted, ``and my brother won't see us. I have to tell you that I am going no further with you.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the first place, I can't say it in the street; secondly, you must hear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show you some papers....
<p/>Oh well, if you won't agree to come with me, I shall refuse to give any explanation and go away at once.
<p/>But I beg you not to forget that a very curious secret of your beloved brother's is entirely in my keeping.
<p/>Speak to me here. You can tell it all in the street.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>'' Dounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at Svidrigaïlov with searching eyes.
<p/>'' What are you afraid of? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) observed quietly. '' The town is not the country. And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No, I have not said a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dounia</b></font>) and am not quite certain whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Dounia</b></font>) is at home now.
<p/>But most likely she (<font color='blue'><b>Dounia</b></font>) is. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dounia</b></font>) has buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Dounia</b></font>) stepmother to-day: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dounia</b></font>) is not likely to go visiting on such a day.
<p/>For the time I don't want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken to you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like this.
<p/>I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That's the porter of our house--he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) knows me very well
<p/>; you see, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>)'s bowing; he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) sees I'm coming with a lady and no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) has noticed your face already and you will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious.
<p/>Excuse my putting things so coarsely. I haven't a flat to myself; Sofya Semyonovna's room is next to mine--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lodges in the next flat.
<p/>The whole floor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a child? Am I really so terrible? ''
<p/>Svidrigaïlov's lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was in no smiling mood. His (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) heart was throbbing and he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) could scarcely breathe.
<p/>But Dounia did not notice this peculiar excitement, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so irritated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) remark that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was frightened of him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) like a child and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was so terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) spoke rather loud to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) growing excitement. '' Though I know that you are not a man... of honour, I am not in the least afraid of you.
<p/>Lead the way,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said with apparent composure, but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face was very pale. Svidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia's room. <div class="bookquote">``Allow me to inquire whether she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is at home....
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is not. How unfortunate! But I know she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may come quite soon. If she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s gone out, it can only be to see a lady about the orphans.
<p/>Their mother is dead.... I've been meddling and making arrangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovna does not come back in ten minutes, I will send her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to you, to-day if you like.
<p/>This is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich, my landlady, has the next room. Now, look this way.
<p/>I will show you my chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into two perfectly empty rooms, which are to let.
<p/>Here they are... You must look into them with some attention. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>Svidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. Dounia was looking about her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in the furniture or position of the rooms.
<p/>Yet there was something to observe, for instance, that Svidrigaïlov's flat was exactly between two sets of almost uninhabited apartments. His (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) rooms were not entered directly from the passage, but through the landlady's two almost empty rooms.
<p/>Unlocking a door leading out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) bedroom, Svidrigaïlov showed Dounia the two empty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was called to look upon, but Svidrigaïlov hastened to explain.
<p/>'' Look here, at this second large room. Notice that door, it's locked. By the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms.
<p/>I brought it from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently. Just the other side of the door is Sofya Semyonovna's table; she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) sat there talking to Rodion Romanovitch.
<p/>And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, for two hours each time--and of course I was able to learn something, what do you think?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You listened?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did. Now come back to my room; we can't sit down here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sitting-room and offered her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) a chair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least seven feet from her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>), but probably there was the same glow in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes which had once frightened Dounia so much.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) shuddered and once more looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) distrustfully. It was an involuntary gesture; she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) evidently did not wish to betray her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) uneasiness.
<p/>But the secluded position of Svidrigaïlov's lodging had suddenly struck her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) wanted to ask whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) from asking.
<p/>Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had another trouble in her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) heart incomparably greater than fear for herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was in great distress. '' Here is your letter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) said, laying it on the table.
<p/>'' Can it be true what you write? You hint at a crime committed, you say, by my brother. You hint at it too clearly; you daren't deny it now.
<p/>I must tell you that I'd heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don't believe a word of it.
<p/>It's a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know the story and why and how it was invented. You can have no proofs.
<p/>You promised to prove it. Speak! But let me warn you that I don't believe you! I don't believe you!'' Dounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colour rushed to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' If you didn't believe it, how could you risk coming alone to my rooms? Why have you come? Simply from curiosity?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't torment me. Speak, speak!''  (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div>'' There's no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my word, I thought you would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) was not with you nor anywhere near. I was on the look-out. It's spirited of you, it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch.
<p/>But everything is divine in you.... About your brother, what am I to say to you? You've just seen him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) yourself.
<p/>What did you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?'' '' Surely that's not the only thing you are building on?'' '' No, not on that, but on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own words.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came here on two successive evenings to see Sofya Semyonovna. I've shown you where they sat. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) made a full confession to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) killed her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sister too, a pedlar woman called Lizaveta, who happened to come in while he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was murdering her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sister.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is a murderer. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) killed an old woman, a pawnbroker, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had pawned things himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) killed them with an axe he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) murdered them to rob them and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did rob them. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took money and various things.... He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) told all this, word for word, to Sofya Semyonovna, the only person who knows his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) secret.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has had no share by word or deed in the murder; she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was as horrified at it as you are now.
<p/>Don't be anxious, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) won't betray him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``It cannot be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>muttered Dounia, with white lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gasped for breath. '' It cannot be.
<p/>There was not the slightest cause, no sort of ground.... It's a lie, a lie!'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), that was the cause, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took money and things.
<p/>It's true that by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own admission he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) made no use of the money or things, but hid them under a stone, where they are now.
<p/>But that was because he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dared not make use of them.'' '' But how could he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) steal, rob? How could he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dream of it?
<p/>'' cried Dounia, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) jumped up from the chair. '' Why, you know him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and you've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), can he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) be a thief?
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) seemed to be imploring Svidrigaïlov; she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had entirely forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) fear. '' There are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities, Avdotya Romanovna.
<p/>A thief steals and knows he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) is a scoundrel, but I've heard of a gentleman who broke open the mail. Who knows, very likely he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) was doing a gentlemanly thing!
<p/>Of course I should not have believed it myself if I'd been told of it as you have, but I believe my own ears.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) explained all the causes of it to Sofya Semyonovna too, but she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did not believe her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ears at first, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own eyes at last.
<p/>... how shall I tell you?--A theory of a sort, the same one by which I for instance consider that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right, a solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds!
<p/>It's galling too, of course, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole career, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three thousand.
<p/>Add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodging in a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) social position and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister's and mother's position too.
<p/>Above all, vanity, pride and vanity, though goodness knows he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may have good qualities too.... I am not blaming him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), please don't think it; besides, it's not my business.
<p/>A special little theory came in too--a theory of a sort--dividing mankind, you see, into material and superior persons, that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their superiority, who make laws for the rest of mankind, the material, that is.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What... were the causes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Avdotya Romanovna</b></font>)</div>'' It's a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Here's It's all right as a theory, une théorie comme une autre .
<p/>Napoleon attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) tremendously, that is, what affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) was that a great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have overstepped the law without thinking about it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) could make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) is not a man of genius.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) seems to have fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) was a genius too--that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) was convinced of it for a time. And that's humiliating for a young man of any pride, in our day especially...''
<p/>'' But remorse? You deny him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) any moral feeling then? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like that?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it was ever in very good order.
<p/>Russians in general are broad in their ideas, Avdotya Romanovna, broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to the fantastic, the chaotic.
<p/>Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on this subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper?
<p/>But it's a misfortune to be broad without a special genius. Why, you used to reproach me with breadth! Who knows, perhaps we were talking at the very time when he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) was lying here thinking over his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) plan.
<p/>There are no sacred traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class, Avdotya Romanovna. At the best someone will make them up somehow for himself out of books or from some old chronicle.
<p/>But those are for the most part the learned and all old fogeys, so that it would be almost ill-bred in a man of society.
<p/>You know my opinions in general, though. I never blame anyone. I do nothing at all, I persevere in that. But we've talked of this more than once before.

<p/>Almost fainting, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sank on to a chair which Svidrigaïlov made haste to give her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). '' Avdotya Romanovna, what is it?
<p/>Control yourself! Here is some water. Drink a little... '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) sprinkled some water over her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Dounia shuddered and came to herself.
<p/>'' It has acted violently,'' Svidrigaïlov muttered to himself, frowning. '' Avdotya Romanovna, calm yourself! Believe me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) has friends. We will save him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>).
<p/>Would you like me to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) abroad? I have money, I can get a ticket in three days. And as for the murder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) will do all sorts of good deeds yet, to atone for it.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It all depends on you, on you, on you alone,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began with glowing eyes, almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for emotion.

<p/>I'll send him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) away at once. I'll get a passport, two passports, one for him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) and one for me. I have friends...
<p/>capable people.... If you like, I'll take a passport for you... for your mother.... What do you want with Razumihin? I love you too....
<p/>I love you beyond everything.... Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, let me.... The very rustle of it is too much for me.
<p/>Tell me, `do that,' and I'll do it. I'll do everything. I will do the impossible. What you believe, I will believe.
<p/>I'll do anything--anything! Don't, don't look at me like that. Do you know that you are killing me?... '' He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was almost beginning to rave....
<p/>Something seemed suddenly to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head. Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door. <div class="bookquote">``Open it! Open it! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) called, shaking the door. <div class="bookquote">``Open it! Is there no one there? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>Svidrigaïlov got up and came to himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) still trembling lips slowly broke into an angry mocking smile.
<p/>'' There is no one at home,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) said quietly and emphatically. '' The landlady has gone out, and it's waste of time to shout like that.
<p/>You are only exciting yourself uselessly. '' <div class="bookquote">``Where is the key? Open the door at once, at once, base man!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have lost the key and cannot find it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div><p/>'' This is an outrage,'' cried Dounia, turning pale as death. She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) rushed to the furthest corner, where she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) made haste to barricade herself with a little table.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) did not scream, but she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) tormentor and watched every movement he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) made. Svidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was positively composed, at least in appearance, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) face was pale as before. The mocking smile did not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna. In that case you may be sure I've taken measures. Sofya Semyonovna is not at home.
<p/>The Kapernaumovs are far away--there are five locked rooms between. I am at least twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides.
<p/>For you could not complain afterwards. You surely would not be willing actually to betray your brother? Besides, no one would believe you.
<p/>How should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodgings? So that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing.
<p/>It is very difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna.'' <div class="bookquote">``Scoundrel!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>whispered Dounia indignantly. '' As you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of a general proposition.
<p/>I only spoke to show you that you need have no remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of your own accord, as I suggest to you.
<p/>It's my personal conviction that you are perfectly right--violence is hateful. You would be simply submitting to circumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word.
<p/>Think about it. Your brother's and your mother's fate are in your hands. I will be your slave... all my life...
<p/>I will wait here. '' Svidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had not the slightest doubt now of his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) unbending determination.
<p/>Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>). Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pulled out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pocket a revolver, cocked it and laid it in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand on the table.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov jumped up. <div class="bookquote">``Aha! So that's it, is it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) cried, surprised but smiling maliciously. '' Well, that completely alters the aspect of affairs.
<p/>You've made things wonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna. But where did you get the revolver? Was it Mr. Razumihin? Why, it's my revolver, an old friend!
<p/>And how I've hunted for it! The shooting lessons I've given you in the country have not been thrown away.'' ''
<p/>It's not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed, wretch! There was nothing of yours in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) house.
<p/>I took it when I began to suspect what you were capable of. If you dare to advance one step, I swear I'll kill you.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was frantic. '' But your brother? I ask from curiosity,'' said Svidrigaïlov, still standing where he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was. '' Inform, if you want to!
<p/>Don't stir! Don't come nearer! I'll shoot! You poisoned your wife, I know ; you are a murderer yourself!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) held the revolver ready.
<p/>'' Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?'' <div class="bookquote">``You did! You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of poison....
<p/>I know you went to get it... you had it in readiness.... It was your doing.... It must have been your doing.... Scoundrel!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Even if that were true, it would have been for your sake... you would have been the cause. '' <div class="bookquote">``You are lying!
<p/>I hated you always, always...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oho, Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to have forgotten how you softened to me in the heat of propaganda.
<p/>I saw it in your eyes. Do you remember that moonlight night, when the nightingale was singing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>'' That's a lie,'' there was a flash of fury in Dounia's eyes, <div class="bookquote">``that's a lie and a libel!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div><p/>'' A lie? Well, if you like, it's a lie. I made it up. Women ought not to be reminded of such things,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) smiled.
<p/>Dounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), measuring the distance and awaiting the first movement on his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) part.
<p/>'' I know you will shoot, you pretty wild creature. Well, shoot away!'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lower lip was white and quivering and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) big black eyes flashed like fire.
<p/>The fire glowing in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes at the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) raised the revolver seemed to kindle him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) and there was a pang of anguish in his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) so handsome. He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) took a step forward and a shot rang out. The bullet grazed his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) hair and flew into the wall behind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) stood still and laughed softly. '' The wasp has stung me. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) aimed straight at my head. What's this? Blood?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed in a thin stream down his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) right temple. The bullet seemed to have just grazed the skin.
<p/>Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov not so much in terror as in a sort of wild amazement. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seemed not to understand what she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was doing and what was going on.
<p/>'' Well, you missed! Fire again, I'll wait,'' said Svidrigaïlov softly, still smiling, but gloomily. '' If you go on like that, I shall have time to seize you before you cock again.
<p/>'' Dounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it. <div class="bookquote">``Let me be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cried in despair. '' I swear I'll shoot again.
<p/>I... I'll kill you.'' '' Well... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you don't... then. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) eyes flashed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) took two steps forward.
<p/>Dounia shot again: it missed fire. '' You haven't loaded it properly. Never mind, you have another charge there. Get it ready, I'll wait.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) stood facing her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), two paces away, waiting and gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with wild determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes.
<p/>'' Dounia saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) would sooner die than let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) go. '' And... now, of course she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), at two paces!''
<p/>A weight seemed to have rolled from his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) heart--perhaps not only the fear of death; indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) may scarcely have felt it at that moment.
<p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) flung away the revolver. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s dropped it!'' said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) drew a deep breath. It was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) could not himself have defined.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) went to Dounia and gently put his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) waist. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did not resist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) with suppliant eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) tried to say something, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) lips moved without being able to utter a sound. '' Let me go,'' Dounia implored.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov shuddered. Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) voice now was quite different. '' Then you don't love me? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) asked softly. Dounia shook her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' And... and you can't? Never? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) whispered in despair. '' Never!'' There followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of Svidrigaïlov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) took it out of the left pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) coat and laid it on the table behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), without turning or looking at Dounia.
<p/>Another moment passed. '' Here's the key. '' <div class="bookquote">``Take it! Make haste!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went up to the table to take the key.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make haste! Make haste! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>repeated Svidrigaïlov, still without turning or moving. But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that <div class="bookquote">``make haste.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>Dounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it quickly and rushed out of the room.
<p/>A minute later, beside herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge. Svidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) slowly turned, looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) and passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) forehead. A strange smile contorted his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of despair.
<p/>The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) temple.
<p/>The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) eye. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) picked it up and examined it.
<p/>It was a little pocket three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction. There were still two charges and one capsule left in it.
<p/>It could be fired again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) thought a little, put the revolver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) pocket, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) hat and went out.
<p/>CHAPTER VI He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) spent that evening till ten o'clock going from one low haunt to another. Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain <div class="bookquote">``villain and tyrant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katia</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``began kissing Katia.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) was particularly drawn to these clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the left and the other to the right.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Katia</b></font>)</div>Svidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and the waiters and two little clerks. They took him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) finally to a pleasure garden, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) paid for their entrance.
<p/>There was one lanky three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a <div class="bookquote">``Vauxhall,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.
<p/>A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) listened to them for a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no possibility of understanding them.
<p/>The only fact that seemed certain was that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) companion.
<p/>The clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent. Svidrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon belonging to the Vauxhall.
<p/>It was missed and the affair began to seem troublesome. Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of the garden.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than anything.
<p/>It was about six o'clock. It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over the sky about ten o'clock.
<p/>There was a clap of thunder, and the rain came down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the earth in streams.
<p/>Drenched to the skin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) went home, locked himself in, opened the bureau, took out all his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) money and tore up two or three papers.
<p/>Then, putting the money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was about to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) clothes, but, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the rain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) gave up the idea, took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) hat and went out of the room without locking the door.
<p/>There were flashes of lightning every minute and each flash lasted while one could count five. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) went straight to Sonia.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was at home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was giving them tea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence, looking wonderingly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) soaking clothes.
<p/>The children all ran away at once in indescribable terror. Svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>).
<p/>I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,'' said Svidrigaïlov, <div class="bookquote">``and as I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some arrangements.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) timidly prepared to listen. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said to you, you need not tell me.
<p/>As to your sisters and your brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them I've put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments.
<p/>'' -LRB-Sonia made a movement and blushed.-RRB- '' Those people have their own way of doing things. You had better take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens.
<p/>Take those for yourself, entirely for yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one knows of it, whatever you hear.
<p/>You will need the money, for to go on living in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no need for it now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my stepmother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>said Sonia hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">``and if I've said so little... please don't consider...
<p/>Here, take them! Well now, that's settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the value of three thousand roubles. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/>That's enough! that's enough!'' '' But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you, but I don't need it now.
<p/>I can always earn my own living. Don't think me ungrateful. If you are so charitable, that money...'' <div class="bookquote">``It's for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don't waste words over it.
<p/>I haven't time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitch has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Sonia looked wildly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), and started.-RRB- '' Don't be uneasy, I know all about it from himself and I am not a gossip; I won't tell anyone.
<p/>It was good advice when you told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) to give himself up and confess. It would be much better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) will go and you will follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>). That's so, isn't it? And if so, you'll need money.
<p/>You'll need it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), do you understand? Giving it to you is the same as my giving it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay what's owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so heedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna?
<p/>It was Katerina Ivanovna's debt and not yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.
<p/>If you are ever questioned about me--to-morrow or the day after you will be asked--don't say anything about my coming to see you now and don't show the money to anyone or say a word about it.
<p/>You can't get through the world like that. Well, now good-bye. '' -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) got up.-RRB- '' My greetings to Rodion Romanovitch.
<p/>By the way, you'd better put the money for the present in Mr. Razumihin's keeping. You know Mr. Razumihin? Of course you do.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>)'s not a bad fellow. Take it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) to-morrow or... when the time comes. And till then, hide it carefully.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) did not dare and did not know how to begin.
<p/>'' Sonia too jumped up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigaïlov. '' How can you... how can you be going now, in such rain?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! Ha, ha! Good-bye, Sofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and live long, you will be of use to others.
<p/>By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>). Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) greetings. Be sure to.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague apprehension. It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) made another very eccentric and unexpected visit.
<p/>Drenched to the skin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) walked into the little flat where the parents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky Island.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) knocked some time before he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was admitted, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) visit at first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov could be very fascinating when he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) liked, so that the first, and indeed very intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that Svidrigaïlov had probably had so much to drink that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) did not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was doing vanished immediately.
<p/>The decrepit father was wheeled in to see Svidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the conversation with various irrelevant questions.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never asked a direct question, but began by smiling and rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands and then, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when Svidrigaïlov would like to have the wedding--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would begin by interested and almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street.
<p/>On other occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) betrothed at once, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) had been informed, to begin with, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had already gone to bed.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov informed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was obliged by very important affairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fifteen thousand roubles and begged her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) accept them as a present from him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had long been intending to make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) this trifling present before their wedding.
<p/>The logical connection of the present with his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear.
<p/>But it all went off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret, the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained.
<p/>On the other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced by tears from the most sensible of mothers.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov got up, laughed, kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) betrothed, patted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cheek, declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) would soon come back, and noticing in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes, together with childish curiosity, a sort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) present would be immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of the most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidrigaïlov was a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great wealth--there was no knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) would start off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), so that there was nothing surprising about it.
<p/>Of course it was strange that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric, and all these people of high society didn't think of what was said of them and didn't stand on ceremony.
<p/>The rain still persisted. The girl of course appeared. Possibly, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) came like that on purpose to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was not afraid of anyone.
<p/>Above all, not a word should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and the money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the cook, had not left the kitchen.
<p/>And above all not a word must be said to that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on.
<p/>They sat up whispering till two o'clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier, amazed and rather sorrowful. Svidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the way back to the mainland.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) began shivering, and for one moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) gazed at the black waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.
<p/>The rain had ceased and there was a roaring wind. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) turned and went towards Y. Prospect.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) walked along that endless street for a long time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side of the street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had noticed passing through this street lately that there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly large, and its name he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) remembered was something like Adrianople.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) could not fail to see it even in the dark.
<p/>It was a long, blackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were lights in the windows and signs of life within.
<p/>The latter, scanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) at once to a close and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under the stairs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) went in and asked a ragged fellow who met him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) in the corridor for a room. There was no other, all were occupied.
<p/>The ragged fellow looked inquiringly. '' Is there tea? '' asked Svidrigaïlov. '' Yes, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``What else is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Veal, vodka, savouries.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bring me tea and veal.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And you want nothing else? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Veal</b></font>) asked with apparent surprise. '' Nothing, nothing.
<p/>'' The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned. '' It must be a nice place,'' thought Svidrigaïlov. '' How was it
<p/>I didn't know it? I expect I look as if I came from a café chantant and have had some adventure on the way.
<p/>It would be interesting to know who stayed here?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a room
<p/>; it had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained chair and table almost filled it up.
<p/>The walls looked as though they were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general colour--yellow--could still be made out.
<p/>One of the walls was cut short by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under the stairs.
<p/>so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it Svidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into thought.
<p/>But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout in the next room attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) attention. The murmur had not ceased from the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) entered the room.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) hand and at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) saw light through a crack in the wall; he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) went up and peeped through.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) listened: someone was upbraiding and almost tearfully scolding, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) heard only one voice. The room, which was somewhat larger than his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), had two occupants.
<p/>One of them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing in the pose of an orator, without his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) coat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) legs wide apart to preserve his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) balance, and smiting himself on the breast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) had taken the other out of the gutter and he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) could turn him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) out when he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it all.
<p/>The object of his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can't.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sometimes turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not the slightest idea what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was talking about and scarcely heard it.
<p/>A candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs of stale tea.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reproached the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. After gazing attentively at this, Svidrigaïlov turned away indifferently and sat down on the bed.
<p/>The ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) again whether he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) didn't want anything more, and again receiving a negative reply, finally withdrew.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a glass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) began to feel feverish.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) coat and, wrapping himself in the blanket, lay down on the bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was annoyed. '' It would have been better to be well for the occasion,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) thought with a smile.
<p/>The room was close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) heard a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of leather.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) felt a longing to fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) imagination on something.
<p/>'' It must be a garden under the window,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) thought. '' There's a sound of trees. How I dislike the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark!
<p/>They give one a horrid feeling. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had disliked it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) passed Petrovsky Park just now.
<p/>This reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) of the bridge over the Little Neva and he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) felt cold again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had when standing there.
<p/>'' I never have liked water,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``even in a landscape,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) suddenly smiled again at a strange idea:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely now all these questions of taste and comfort ought not to matter, but I've become more particular, like an animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion.
<p/>I ought to have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold, ha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!...
<p/>By the way, why haven't I put out the candle? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) blew it out. '' They've gone to bed next door,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) thought, not seeing the light at the crack.
<p/>Well, now, Marfa Petrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it's dark, and the very time and place for you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) design on Dounia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to Razumihin's keeping.
<p/>'' But now you won't come! '' '' I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to tease myself.
<p/>But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'s gone through a good deal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) may be a successful rogue in time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'s got over his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) nonsense.
<p/>But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)'s too eager for life. These young men are contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) please himself, it's nothing to do with me.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia's image rose before him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and a shudder ran over him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). ''
<p/>No, I must give up all that now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thought, rousing himself. '' I must think of something else. It's queer and funny.
<p/>I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly desired to avenge myself even, and that's a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad sign.
<p/>I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--that's a bad sign too. And the promises I made her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) just now, too--Damnation!
<p/>But--who knows?--perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) would have made a new man of me somehow... '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ground his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth and sank into silence again.
<p/>Again Dounia's image rose before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), just as she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was when, after shooting the first time, she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have seized her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) twice over and she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) would not have lifted a hand to defend herself if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recalled how at that instant he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt almost sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had felt a pang at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly something seemed to run over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm and leg under the bedclothes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aïe! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it away!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started. '' Ugh! hang it! I believe it's a mouse,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``that's the veal I left on the table.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the blanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shaking with feverish chill he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without leaving the bed, slipped between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers, ran over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand and suddenly darted under the pillow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw down the pillow, but in one instant felt something leap on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chest and dart over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body and down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shirt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trembled nervously and woke up. The room was dark.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket as before. The wind was howling under the window.
<p/>'' How disgusting,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought with annoyance. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back to the window.
<p/>There was a cold damp draught from the window, however; without getting up he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew the blanket over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and wrapped himself in it.
<p/>'' It's better not to sleep at all,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) decided. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not thinking of anything and did not want to think.
<p/>But one image rose after another, incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sank into drowsiness.
<p/>Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or the dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept dwelling on images of flowers, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fancied a charming flower garden, a bright, warm, almost hot day, a holiday--Trinity day.
<p/>A fine, sumptuous country cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with flower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was surrounded with beds of roses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noticed particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant narcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was reluctant to move away from them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went up the stairs and came into a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows, the doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.
<p/>The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows were open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room.
<p/>The birds were chirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table covered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin.
<p/>The coffin was covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of flowers surrounded it on all sides.
<p/>Among the flowers lay a girl in a white muslin dress, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms crossed and pressed on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bosom, as though carved out of marble.
<p/>A light, cool staircase, carpeted with rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. But her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loose fair hair was wet; there was a wreath of roses on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head.
<p/>The stern and already rigid profile of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had destroyed herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was only fourteen, but her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart was broken. Svidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the window.
<p/>The wind lashed furiously into the little room and stung his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) face and his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) chest, only covered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) shirt, as though with frost.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) felt for the latch and opened it. Under the window there must have been something like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden.
<p/>Now drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as in a cellar, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) could only just make out some dark blurs of objects.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill, gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed by a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night.
<p/>There, too, probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. '' Ah, the signal! The river is overflowing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) thought.
<p/>The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys.
<p/>'' By morning it will be swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and cellars. What time is it now?
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three. <div class="bookquote">``Aha!
<p/>I'll choose a great bush there drenched with rain, so that as soon as one's shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on one's head.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) waistcoat, his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) overcoat and his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) hat and went out, carrying the candle, into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) for the room and leave the hotel.
<p/>It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I'll go out at once straight to the park. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It's the best minute; I couldn't choose a better.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the door he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) caught sight of a strange object which seemed to be alive.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) bent down with the candle and saw a little girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not seem afraid of Svidrigaïlov, but looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) with blank amazement out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) big black eyes.
<p/>Now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sobbed as children do when they have been crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted.
<p/>The child's face was pale and tired, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was numb with cold. '' How can she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) have come here? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must have hidden here and not slept all night.
<p/>The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) baby language, something about <div class="bookquote">``mammy''  (<font color='red'><b>baby</b></font>)</div>and that <div class="bookquote">``mammy would beat her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>baby</b></font>)</div>and about some cup that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``bwoken.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could only guess from what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a neglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service of the hotel, whipped and frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); that the child had broken a cup of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's and was so frightened that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had run away the evening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the rain, at last had made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness and the fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be badly beaten for it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) began questioning her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). '' The child chattered on without stopping. He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) arms, went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) room, sat her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) on the bed, and began undressing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>The torn shoes which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stockingless feet were as wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) had undressed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) on the bed, covered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up and wrapped her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in the blanket from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head downwards.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fell asleep at once. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) sank into dreary musing again. '' What folly to trouble myself,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) decided suddenly with an oppressive feeling of annoyance.
<p/>In vexation he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) took up the candle to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.
<p/>'' What idiocy!'' '' Damn the child! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) thought as he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) opened the door, but he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) turned again to see whether the child was asleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) raised the blanket carefully. The child was sleeping soundly, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had got warm under the blanket, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pale cheeks were flushed.
<p/>But strange to say that flush seemed brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. '' It's a flush of fever,'' thought Svidrigaïlov.
<p/>It was like the flush from drinking, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been given a full glass to drink. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) crimson lips were hot and glowing; but what was this?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) suddenly fancied that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) long black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little girl were not asleep, but pretending.
<p/>Yes, it was so. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lips parted in a smile. The corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth quivered, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were trying to control them.
<p/>, now it was a grin, a broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite unchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the shameless face of a French harlot.
<p/>But now she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) quite gave up all effort Now both eyes opened wide; they turned a glowing, shameless glance upon him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>); they laughed, invited him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)....
<p/>There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child.
<p/>'' What, at five years old?'' Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror. '' What does it mean? '' And now she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little face all aglow, holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms...
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Accursed child!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) hand to strike her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but at that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) woke up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket.
<p/>The candle had not been lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows. '' I've had nightmare all night! ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) got up angrily, feeling utterly shattered; his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) could see nothing.
<p/>Feeling the revolver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few lines in large letters.
<p/>Reading them over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) sank into thought with his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on the table.
<p/>It was nearly five. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had overslept himself! He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) got up, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) still damp jacket and overcoat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) stared at them and at last with his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) free right hand began trying to catch one.
<p/>At last, realising that he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) started, got up and walked resolutely out of the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) tried till he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was tired, but could not catch it. A minute later he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was in the street. A thick milky mist hung over the town.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was picturing the waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island, the wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the bush....
<p/>Svidrigaïlov walked along the slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think of something else.
<p/>There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street. The bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with their closed shutters.
<p/>The cold and damp penetrated his (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) whole body and he (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) began to shiver. From time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) came across shop signs and read each carefully.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) reached the end of the wooden pavement and came to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) path with its tail between its legs.
<p/>A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead drunk, across the pavement. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and went on. A high tower stood up on the left.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouted, <div class="bookquote">``here is a place. Why should it be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an official witness anyway....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where there was the big house with the tower.
<p/>At the great closed gates of the house, a little man stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder leaning against them, wrapped in a grey soldier's coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov. They both, Svidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes without speaking.
<p/>At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man not drunk to be standing three steps from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), staring and not saying a word.
<p/>'' What do you want here? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, without moving or changing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position. '' Nothing, brother, good morning,'' answered Svidrigaïlov.
<p/>'' This isn't the place.'' <div class="bookquote">``I am going to foreign parts, brother.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' To foreign parts?'' <div class="bookquote">``To America.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``America. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov/Mr. Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)</div>Svidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it.
<p/>Achilles raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) eyebrows. '' I say, this is not the place for such jokes!'' <div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't it be the place?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Because it isn't.'' '' Well, brother, I don't mind that. It's a good place. When you are asked, you just say he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was going, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, to America.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) put the revolver to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) right temple. '' You can't do it here, it's not the place,'' cried Achilles, rousing himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) eyes growing bigger and bigger.
<p/>The same day, about seven o'clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother's and sister's lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyev's house which Razumihin had found for them.
<p/>Svidrigaïlov pulled the trigger. CHAPTER VII The stairs went up from the street. Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still hesitating whether to go or not.
<p/>But nothing would have turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) back: his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) decision was taken. '' Besides, it doesn't matter, they still know nothing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and they are used to thinking of me as eccentric.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was appallingly dressed: his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a night's rain. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the inward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had spent all the previous night alone, God knows where. But anyway he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had reached a decision. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knocked at the door which was opened by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother.
<p/>At first Pulcheria Alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) by the hand and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) into the room.
<p/>Dounia was not at home. Even the servant happened to be out. '' Here you are! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began, faltering with joy.
<p/>'' Don't be angry with me, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not crying. Did you think I was crying?
<p/>No, I am delighted, but I've got into such a stupid habit of shedding tears. I've been like that ever since your father's death.
<p/>I cry for anything. Sit down, dear boy, you must be tired; I see you are. Ah, how muddy you are.
<p/>No, no,'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted, <div class="bookquote">``you thought I was going to cross-question you in the womanish way I used to; don't be anxious
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was in the rain yesterday, mother... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov began. '' , I understand, I understand it all: now I've learned the ways here
<p/>I've made up my mind once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect you to give an account of them?
<p/>God knows what concerns and plans you may have, or what ideas you are hatching; so it's not for me to keep nudging your elbow, asking you what you are thinking about?
<p/>and truly I see for myself that they are better. But, my goodness! why am I running to and fro as though I were crazy...?
<p/>I am reading your article in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. Dmitri Prokofitch brought it to me. Directly I saw it I cried out to myself: `There, foolish one,'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) may have some new ideas in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) head just now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) is thinking them over and I worry him (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) and upset him (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>).'
<p/>I read it, my dear, and of course there was a great deal I did not understand; but that's only natural--how should I?''
<p/>I thought, `that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) is busy about; that's the solution of the mystery! Learned people are always like that. <div class="bookquote">``Show me, mother.
<p/>Incongruous as it was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) mood and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) circumstances, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) felt that strange and bitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) sees himself in print; besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) was only twenty-three.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) article. It lasted only a moment. After reading a few lines he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) frowned and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart throbbed with anguish.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding months. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) flung the article on the table with disgust and anger.
<p/>But, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for myself that you will very soon be one of the leading--if not the leading man--in the world of Russian thought.
<p/>'' And they dared to think you were mad! You don't know, but they really thought that. Ah, the despicable creatures, how could they understand genius!
<p/>the first time poems -LRB-I've got the manuscript and will show you-RRB- and the second time a whole novel -LRB-I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) to let me copy it out-RRB- and how we prayed that they should be taken--they weren't!
<p/>I was breaking my heart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your clothes and the way you are living.
<p/>But now I see again how foolish I was, for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and talent.
<p/>And Dounia, Dounia was all but believing it--what do you say to that? Your father sent twice to magazines-- No doubt you don't care about that for the present and you are occupied with much more important matters...
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Dounia's not at home, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Rodya.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) loves you and respects you, my dear. I don't say that Dounia is very wanting in consideration. I am not complaining.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ways and I have mine; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seems to have got some secrets of late and I never have any secrets from you two.
<p/>Of course, I am sure that Dounia has far too much sense, and besides she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loves you and me... but I don't know what it will all lead to.
<p/>You've made me so happy by coming now, Rodya, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has missed you by going out; when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) comes in I'll tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>): `Your brother came in while you were out.

<p/>Where have you been all this time?' I shall know, anyway, that you are fond of me, that will be enough for me.
<p/>I shall read what you write, I shall hear about you from everyone, and sometimes you'll come yourself to see me.
<p/>What could be better? Here you've come now to comfort your mother, I see that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pulcheria Alexandrovna</b></font>)</div>Here Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.
<p/>'' Here I am again! Don't mind my foolishness. My goodness, why am I sitting here? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried, jumping up.
<p/>'' There is coffee and I don't offer you any. Ah, that's the selfishness of old age. I'll get it at once!''
<p/>'' Mother, don't trouble, I am going at once. I haven't come for that. Please listen to me. '' Pulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) timidly.
<p/>Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you are told about me, will you always love me as you do now?
<p/>'' '' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) asked suddenly from the fullness of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) heart, as though not thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) words and not weighing them.
<p/>'' Rodya, Rodya, what is the matter? How can you ask me such a question? Why, who will tell me anything about you?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come to assure you that I've always loved you and I am glad that we are alone, even glad Dounia is out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went on with the same impulse.
<p/>I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, you must believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that all you thought about me, that I was cruel and didn't care about you, was all a mistake.
<p/>Besides, I shouldn't believe anyone, I should refuse to listen.'' '' I shall never cease to love you.... Well, that's enough: I thought I must do this and begin with this...
<p/>'' Pulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in silence, pressing him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) bosom and weeping gently. '' I don't know what is wrong with you, Rodya,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said at last.
<p/>'' I've been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see that there is a great sorrow in store for you, and that's why you are miserable.
<p/>I've foreseen it a long time, Rodya. Forgive me for speaking about it. I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights.
<p/>Your sister lay talking in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you. I caught something, but I couldn't make it out.
<p/>I felt all the morning as though I were going to be hanged, waiting for something, expecting something, and now it has come!
<p/>Rodya, Rodya, where are you going? You are going away somewhere?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' That's what I thought! I can come with you, you know, if you need me.
<p/>And Dounia, too; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) loves you, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) loves you dearly--and Sofya Semyonovna may come with us if you like. You see, I am glad to look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as a daughter even...
<p/>Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together. But... where... are you going?'' <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, mother.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What, to-day? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried, as though losing him (<font color='blue'><b>Prokofitch</b></font>) for ever.
<p/>'' I can't stay, I must go now...'' '' And can't I come with you?'' '' No, but kneel down and pray to God for me.
<p/>Your prayer perhaps will reach Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``Let me bless you and sign you with the cross. That's right , that's right.
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was glad, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was very glad that there was no one there, that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother.
<p/>Oh, God, what are we doing? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>For the first time after all those awful months his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart was softened. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fell down before her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feet and both wept, embracing.
<p/>For some days she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had realised that something awful was happening to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son and that now some terrible minute had come for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not surprised and did not question him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) this time. '' Rodya, my darling, my first born,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said sobbing, <div class="bookquote">``now you are just as when you were little.
<p/>You would run like this to me and hug me and kiss me. When your father was living and we were poor, you comforted us simply by being with us
<p/>and when I buried your father, how often we wept together at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grave and embraced, as now. And if I've been crying lately, it's that my mother's heart had a foreboding of trouble.
<p/>The first time I saw you, that evening, you remember, as soon as we arrived here, I guessed simply from your eyes.
<p/>My heart sank at once, and to-day when I opened the door and looked at you, I thought the fatal hour had come.
<p/>Rodya, Rodya, you are not going away to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll come again?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yes... I'll come. '' <div class="bookquote">``Rodya, don't be angry, I don't dare to question you.
<p/>I know I mustn't. Only say two words to me--is it far where you are going?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very far. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is awaiting you there?
<p/>Some post or career for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What God sends... only pray for me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov went to the door, but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) clutched him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and gazed despairingly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face worked with terror. '' Enough, mother,'' said Raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had come. '' Not for ever, it's not yet for ever?
<p/>You'll come, you'll come to-morrow?'' '' I will, I will, good-bye. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tore himself away at last. It was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning.
<p/>Raskolnikov went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lodgings; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) made haste. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wanted to finish all before sunset. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not want to meet anyone till then.
<p/>Going up the stairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) intently. '' Can anyone have come to see me?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) wondered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had a disgusted vision of Porfiry. But opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) door he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw Dounia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) was sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, and looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) had been waiting a long time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stopped short in the doorway. She (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) rose from the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) eyes, fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), betrayed horror and infinite grief.
<p/>And from those eyes alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw at once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) knew. '' Am I to come in or go away?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked uncertainly. '' I've been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both waiting for you. We thought that you would be sure to come there.
<p/>I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have liked at this moment to be able to control myself.
<p/>'' Raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) mistrustfully. '' Where were you all night?''
<p/>You see, sister, I wanted to make up my mind once for all, and several times I walked by the Neva, I remember that I wanted to end it all there,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember clearly. but... I couldn't make up my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) whispered, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Porfiry</b></font>) mistrustfully again. <div class="bookquote">``Thank God! That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya Semyonovna and I.
<p/>Then you still have faith in life? Thank God, thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov smiled bitterly. '' I haven't faith, but I have just been weeping in mother's arms
<p/>; I haven't faith, but I have just asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to pray for me. I don't know how it is, Dounia, I don't understand it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been at mother's? Have you told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>cried Dounia, horror-stricken. '' Surely you haven't done that?'' '' No, I didn't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)... in words; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) understood a great deal.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard you talking in your sleep. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) half understands it already. Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>I don't know why I did go. I am a contemptible person, Dounia.'' <div class="bookquote">``A contemptible person, but ready to face suffering!
<p/>Yes, to escape the disgrace I thought of drowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into the water, I thought that if I had considered myself strong till now I'd better not be afraid of disgrace,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, hurrying on.
<p/>There was a gleam of fire in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lustreless eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seemed to be glad to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was still proud.
<p/>You are, aren't you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am going. At once. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>It's pride, Dounia.'' <div class="bookquote">``Pride, Rodya. ''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>'' You don't think, sister, that I was simply afraid of the water?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked, looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face with a sinister smile. '' Oh, Rodya, hush! '' cried Dounia bitterly. Silence lasted for two minutes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the other end of the table and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) with anguish.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) got up. '' It's late, it's time to go! I am going at once to give myself up. But I don't know why I am going to give myself up.
<p/>'' Big tears fell down her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cheeks. '' You are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand to me?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You doubted it?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). '' Aren't you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cried, holding him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) close and kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Crime? What crime? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cried in sudden fury. '' That I killed a vile noxious insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of use to no one!...
<p/>I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking of expiating it, and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides? '
<p/>Killing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was atonement for forty sins. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sucking the life out of poor people. Was that a crime? A crime! a crime!'
<p/>It's simply because I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to, perhaps too for my advantage, as that...
<p/>Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice, now that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace. Porfiry... suggested!''
<p/>Which all men shed,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put in almost frantically, <div class="bookquote">``which flows and has always flowed in streams, which is spilt like champagne, and for which men are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of mankind.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Brother, brother, what are you saying? Why, you have shed blood? '' cried Dounia in despair. '' Look into it more carefully and understand it!
<p/>I too wanted to do good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of good deeds to make up for that one piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simply clumsiness, for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now that it has failed....
<p/>By that stupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position, to take the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would have been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison...
<p/>-LRB-Everything seems stupid when it fails.-RRB- But I... I couldn't carry out even the first step, because I am contemptible, that's what's the matter!
<p/>And yet I won't look at it as you do. If I had succeeded I should have been crowned with glory, but now I'm trapped.''
<p/>'' But that's not so, not so! Brother, what are you saying?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, it's not picturesque, not æsthetically attractive! I fail to understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable.
<p/>I've never, never recognised this more clearly than now, and I am further than ever from seeing that what I did was a crime.
<p/>The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence. I've never, never been stronger and more convinced than now. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The colour had rushed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) pale exhausted face, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) last explanation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) happened to meet Dounia's eyes and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) saw such anguish in them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) could not help being checked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) had, anyway, made these two poor women miserable, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) was, anyway, the cause... <div class="bookquote">``Dounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me -LRB-though I cannot be forgiven if I am guilty-RRB-.
<p/>Good-bye! We won't dispute. It's time, high time to go. Don't follow me, I beseech you, I have somewhere else to go....
<p/>Don't leave her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) at all; I left her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) in a state of anxiety, that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) is not fit to bear; she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) will die or go out of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mind.
<p/>But you go at once and sit with mother. I entreat you to! It's my last request of you. Be with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)!
<p/>Razumihin will be with you. I've been talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>).... Don't cry about me: I'll try to be honest and manly all my life, even if I am a murderer.
<p/>Now good-bye for the present,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) concluded hurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in Dounia's eyes at his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) last words and promises.
<p/>Perhaps I shall some day make a name. I won't disgrace you, you will see; I'll still show... '' Why are you crying?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) went to the table, took up a thick dusty book, opened it and took from between the pages a little water-colour portrait on ivory.
<p/>It was the portrait of his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) landlady's daughter, who had died of fever, that strange girl who had wanted to be a nun.
<p/>For a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) gazed at the delicate expressive face of his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) betrothed, kissed the portrait and gave it to Dounia.
<p/>Don't cry, don't cry: we are not parting for ever! Ah, yes! Wait a minute, I'd forgotten!'' '' I used to talk a great deal about it to her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>), only to her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) said thoughtfully.
<p/>Don't be uneasy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) returned to Dounia, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) was as much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) is gone.
<p/>The great point is that everything now is going to be different, is going to be broken in two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dounia</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) cried, suddenly returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) dejection.
<p/>'' To her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) heart I confided much of what has since been so hideously realised. '' Everything, everything, and am I prepared for it?
<p/>Do I want it myself? They say it is necessary for me to suffer! What's the object of these senseless sufferings?
<p/>shall I know any better what they are for, when I am crushed by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty years' penal servitude?
<p/>And what shall I have to live for then? Why am I consenting to that life now? Oh, I knew I was contemptible when I stood looking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!''
<p/>At last they both went out. It was hard for Dounia, but she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) walked away, but after going fifty paces she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) turned round to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again.
<p/>At the corner he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too turned and for the last time their eyes met; but noticing that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) motioned her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) away with impatience and even vexation, and turned the corner abruptly.
<p/>I am wicked, I see that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought to himself, feeling ashamed a moment later of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) angry gesture to Dounia.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still in sight. '' '' But why are they so fond of me if I don't deserve it? Oh, if only I were alone and no one loved me
<p/>But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so meek that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word that I am a criminal?
<p/>and I too had never loved anyone! Nothing of all this would have happened. Yes, that's it , that's it, that's what they are sending me there for, that's what they want.
<p/>Look at them running to and fro about the streets, every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at heart and, worse still, an idiot.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, that he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) could be humbled before all of them, indiscriminately--humbled by conviction.
<p/>But try to get me off and they'd be wild with righteous indignation. Oh, how I hate them all!'' And yet why not?
<p/>It must be so. Would not twenty years of continual bondage crush him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) live after that?
<p/>It was the hundredth time perhaps that he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) had asked himself that question since the previous evening, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) went.
<p/>Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) go now when he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) knew that it would be so? CHAPTER VIII When he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) went into Sonia's room, it was already getting dark.
<p/>All day Sonia had been waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been waiting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) that morning, remembering Svidrigaïlov's words that Sonia knew.
<p/>We will not describe the conversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became. Dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) brother would not be alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), Sonia, first with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) confession; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) for human fellowship when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) needed it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wherever fate might send him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/>Dounia did not ask, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) knew it was so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked at Sonia almost with reverence and at first almost embarrassed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) by it.
<p/>Dounia's gracious image when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had bowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) so attentively and respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov's room had remained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mind as one of the fairest visions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) life.
<p/>Dounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) brother's room to await him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) there; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) kept thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would come there first.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it.
<p/>But they had spent the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both were less anxious while they were together.
<p/>Sonia was almost on the point of tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look at Dounia. As soon as they parted, each thought of nothing else.
<p/>Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives--Siberia or... Besides she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) vanity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pride and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lack of faith.
<p/>'' Is it possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) live? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) thought at last in despair.
<p/>Sonia was standing in dejection, looking intently out of the window, but from it she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could see nothing but the unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house.
<p/>Meanwhile the sun was setting. At last when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) began to feel sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) death--he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) walked into the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) turned pale.
<p/>'' Yes,'' said Raskolnikov, smiling. '' I have come for your cross, Sonia. It was you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) tone seemed strange to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>); a cold shiver ran over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), but in a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) guessed that the tone and the words were a mask.
<p/>now it's come to that? '' Sonia gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) astonished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looking away, as though to avoid meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' You see, Sonia, I've decided that it will be better so. There is one fact.... But it's a long story and there's no need to discuss it.
<p/>It annoys me that all those stupid brutish faces will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupid questions, which I shall have to answer--they'll point their fingers at me....
<p/>But do you know what angers me? Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry , I am sick of him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>).
<p/>I'd rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>), what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; I've become too irritable of late.
<p/>You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now, because she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) turned to take a last look at me.
<p/>It's a brutal state to be in! Ah! what am I coming to! Well, where are the crosses? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) seemed hardly to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) was doing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) could not stay still or concentrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) attention on anything; his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) ideas seemed to gallop after one another, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) talked incoherently, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) hands trembled slightly.
<p/>Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress wood and one of copper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) made the sign of the cross over herself and over him (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>), and put the wooden cross on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) neck.
<p/>'' It's the symbol of my taking up the cross,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) laughed. '' As though I had not suffered much till now!
<p/>The wooden cross, that is the peasant one; the copper one, that is Lizaveta's--you will wear yourself, show me! So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had it on... at that moment?
<p/>I remember two things like these too, a silver one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old woman's neck.
<p/>Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what I ought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what matters; I'm somehow forgetful....
<p/>You see I have come to warn you, Sonia, so that you might know ... that's all --that's all I came for.
<p/>But I thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I am going to prison and you'll have your wish.
<p/>Well, what are you crying for? You too? Don't. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!'' But his (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) feeling was stirred; his (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) heart ached, as he (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>'' Why is she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) grieving too? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) thought to himself. '' What am I to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)? Why does she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) weep?
<p/>Why is she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looking after me, like my mother or Dounia? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)'ll be my nurse.'' <div class="bookquote">``Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>Sonia begged in a timid broken voice.
<p/>'' Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, sincerely... '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) wanted to say something quite different.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) shawl and put it over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) head. It was the green drap de dames shawl of which Marmeladov had spoken, <div class="bookquote">``the family shawl.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sofya Semyonovna/Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov/Marmeladov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov thought of that looking at it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not ask. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began to feel himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was frightened at this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia meant to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). ''
<p/>What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! I'll go alone,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) moved towards the door.
<p/>'' What's the use of going in procession? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) muttered going out. Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had not even said good-bye to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). A poignant and rebellious doubt surged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart.
<p/>'' Was it right, was it right, all this? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went down the stairs. '' Couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stop and retract it all... and not go?
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) turned into the street he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had not said good-bye to Sonia, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) in the middle of the room in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) green shawl, not daring to stir after he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had shouted at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stopped short for a moment.
<p/>At the same instant, another thought dawned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), as though it had been lying in wait to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) then.
<p/>'' But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt suddenly once for all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mustn't ask himself questions. '' Why, with what object did I go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) just now?
<p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)--on business; on what business? I had no sort of business! To tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) I was going ; but where was the need?
<p/>Do I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)? No, no, I drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) away just now like a dog. Did I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) crosses? Oh, how low I've sunk!
<p/>No, I wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) tears, I wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) terror, to see how her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) heart ached! I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some friendly face to see!
<p/>And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of what I would do! I am a beggarly contemptible wretch, contemptible!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) walked along the canal bank, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had not much further to go. But on reaching the bridge he (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) stopped and turning out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) way along it went to the Hay Market.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and could not fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) attention on anything; everything slipped away.
<p/>In another week, another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this bridge, how shall I look at the canal then?
<p/>'' I should like to remember this! '' slipped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) mind. '' Look at this sign! How shall I read those letters then?
<p/>It's written here `Campany,' that's a thing to remember, that letter a , and to look at it again in a month--how shall I look at it then?
<p/>What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivial it all must be, what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be interesting... in its way...
<p/>-LRB-Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?-RRB- I am becoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed?
<p/>Foo! how people shove! that fat man--a German he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be--who pushed against me, does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pushed? There's a peasant woman with a baby, begging.
<p/>It's curious that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thinks me happier than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is. I might give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) something, for the incongruity of it. Here's a five copeck piece left in my pocket, where did I get it?
<p/>Here, here... take it, my good woman!'' <div class="bookquote">``God bless you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the beggar</b></font>)</div>the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went into the Hay Market.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would have given anything in the world to be alone; but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would not have remained alone for a moment.
<p/>It was distasteful, very distasteful to be in a crowd, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) walked just where he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw most people. There was a man drunk and disorderly in the crowd; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept trying to dance and falling down.
<p/>Raskolnikov squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) way through the crowd, stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh.
<p/>There was a ring round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). A minute later he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still stared.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved away at last, not remembering where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly came over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), overwhelming him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body and mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suddenly recalled Sonia's words, <div class="bookquote">``Go to the cross-roads, bow down to the people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say aloud to the whole world, 'I am a murderer.'
<p/>And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation.
<p/>It came over him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) soul and spreading fire through him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sonia</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) trembled, remembering that. Everything in him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) softened at once and the tears started into his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) fell to the earth on the spot....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) got up and bowed down a second time. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>)'s boozed,'' a youth near him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) observed. There was a roar of laughter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>)'s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great city of St. Petersburg and its pavement,'' added a workman who was a little drunk.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)'s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) children and his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) country. '' Quite a young man, too!'' observed a third.
<p/>'' And a gentleman,'' someone observed soberly. '' There's no knowing who's a gentleman and who isn't nowadays. '' These exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a murderer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) lips, died away. He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking round, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) turned down a street leading to the police office.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had a glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had felt that it must be so.
<p/>The second time he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) bowed down in the Hay Market he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) saw, standing fifty paces from him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) on the left, Sonia.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was hiding from him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) then on his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) painful way!
<p/>Raskolnikov at that moment felt and knew once for all that Sonia was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) for ever and would follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>It wrung his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart... but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was just reaching the fatal place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went into the yard fairly resolutely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had to mount to the third storey.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) felt as though the fateful moment was still far off, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had plenty of time left for consideration.
<p/>Again the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and the same fumes and stench coming from them.
<p/>'' I shall be some time going up,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought. Raskolnikov had not been here since that day. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) legs were numb and gave way under him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), but still they moved forward.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stopped for a moment to take breath, to collect himself, so as to enter like a man . '' But why? what for?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wondered, reflecting. '' If I must drink the cup what difference does it make? The more revolting the better.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imagined for an instant the figure of the <div class="bookquote">``explosive lieutenant,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Ilya Petrovitch. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) actually going to him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>)? Couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) go to someone else?
<p/>To Nikodim Fomitch? Couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch's lodgings? At least then it would be done privately....
<p/>No, no! To the <div class="bookquote">``explosive lieutenant'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>! If he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) must drink it, drink it off at once. Turning cold and hardly conscious, he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) opened the door of the office.
<p/>There were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and a peasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) screen.
<p/>Raskolnikov walked into the next room. '' Perhaps I still need not speak,'' passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was settling himself at a bureau to write.
<p/>In a corner another clerk was seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch. '' No one in?
<p/>Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent the Russian... how does it go on in the fairy tale...
<p/>'' Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau. '' Whom do you want?'' '' A-ah! I've forgotten! ' At your service!''' a familiar voice cried suddenly.
<p/>Raskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) had just come in from the third room. '' It is the hand of fate,'' thought Raskolnikov.
<p/>'' Why is he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) here?'' '' You've come to see us? What about? '' cried Ilya Petrovitch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle exhilarated.
<p/>'' If it's on business you are rather early. -LSB-*-RSB- It's only a chance that I am here... however I'll do what I can.
<p/>-LSB-*-RSB- Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the police office at two in the afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was reproached for coming too late.--TRANSLATOR.
<p/>I must admit, I... what is it, what is it? Excuse me...'' <div class="bookquote">``Raskolnikov.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn't imagine I'd forgotten?
<p/>Don't think I am like that... Rodion Ro--Ro--Rodionovitch, that's it, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Rodion Romanovitch. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodion Romanovitch/Rodion/Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch!
<p/>I was just getting at it. I made many inquiries about you. I assure you I've been genuinely grieved since that... since I behaved like that...
<p/>it was explained to me afterwards that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... and so to say the first steps...
<p/>Mercy on us! What literary or scientific man does not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and I have the greatest respect for literature, in my wife
<p/>it's a genuine passion! Literature and art! If only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can be gained by talents, learning, good sense, genius.
<p/>I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but what's under the hat, what the hat covers, I can't buy that!
<p/>As for a hat--well, what does a hat matter? I was even meaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you'd...
<p/>But I am forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want really? I hear your family have come?'' '' Yes, my mother and sister.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I've even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister--a highly cultivated and charming person. I confess I was sorry
<p/>I got so hot with you. There it is! But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting fit--that affair has been cleared up splendidly!
<p/>Bigotry and fanaticism! I understand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your lodging on account of your family's arriving?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No, I only looked in...
<p/>I came to ask... I thought that I should find Zametov here. '' '' Oh, yes! Of course, you've made friends, I heard.
<p/>Well, no, Zametov is not here. Yes, we've lost Zametov. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>)'s not been here since yesterday... he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) is a feather-headed youngster, that's all; one might have expected something from him (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>), but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young men.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) wanted to go in for some examination, but it's only to talk and boast about it, it will go no further than that.
<p/>Of course it's a very different matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there, your friend. Your career is an intellectual one and you won't be deterred by failure.
<p/>For you, one may say, all the attractions of life nihil est --you are an ascetic, a monk, a hermit!... A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned research--that's where your spirit soars!
<p/>I am the same way myself.... Have you read Livingstone's Travels?'' <div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know, and indeed it is not to be wondered at.
<p/>What sort of days are they? I ask you. But we thought... you are not a Nihilist of course? Answer me openly, openly!''
<p/>'' N-no... '' <div class="bookquote">``Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself! Official duty is one thing
<p/>It's not friendship, but the feeling of a man and a citizen, the feeling of humanity and of love for the Almighty.
<p/>but... you are thinking I meant to say friendship is quite another? No, you're wrong! I may be an official, but I am always bound to feel myself a man and a citizen....
<p/>Zametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad reputation, over a glass of champagne... that's all your Zametov is good for!
<p/>You were asking about Zametov. While I'm perhaps, so to speak, burning with devotion and lofty feelings, and besides I have rank, consequence, a post!
<p/>I am married and have children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen, but who is he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>), may I ask?
<p/>I appeal to you as a man ennobled by education... Then these midwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyebrows inquiringly.
<p/>The words of Ilya Petrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for the most part a stream of empty sounds for him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>).
<p/>But some of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) understood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) inquiringly, not knowing how it would end. '' I mean those crop-headed wenches,'' the talkative Ilya Petrovitch continued.
<p/>'' Midwives is my name for them. I think it a very satisfactory one, ha-ha! They go to the Academy, study anatomy.
<p/>If I fall ill, am I to send for a young lady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha! ''
<p/>Ilya Petrovitch laughed, quite pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) own wit. '' It's an immoderate zeal for education, but once you're educated, that's enough.
<p/>Why abuse it? Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel Zametov does? Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Zametov</b></font>) insult me, I ask you? Look at these suicides, too, how common they are, you can't fancy!
<p/>People spend their last halfpenny and kill themselves, boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard about a gentleman who had just come to town.
<p/>Nil Pavlitch, I say, what was the name of that gentleman who shot himself?'' <div class="bookquote">``Svidrigaïlov,''  (<font color='red'><b>Svidrigaïlov someone</b></font>)</div>someone answered from the other room with drowsy listlessness.
<p/>Raskolnikov started. '' Svidrigaïlov! Svidrigaïlov has shot himself! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) cried. '' What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?'' '' Yes... I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>)....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) wife, was a man of reckless habits and all of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shocking way....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't been here long. '' '' Yes, that's so. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left faculties and that no one is to blame for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had money, they say. How did you come to know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``I... was acquainted... my sister was governess in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yesterday... he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)... was drinking wine; I knew nothing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and was stifling him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). '' You've turned pale again. It's so stuffy here...''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>muttered Raskolnikov. '' Excuse my troubling you... '' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, not at all, as often as you like.
<p/>It's a pleasure to see you and I am glad to say so. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ilya Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Ilya Petrovitch held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) hand. ''
<p/>I only wanted... I came to see Zametov.'' <div class="bookquote">``I understand, I understand, and it's a pleasure to see you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I... am very glad...
<p/>good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>Raskolnikov smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went out; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) reeled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was overtaken with giddiness and did not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was doing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fancied that a porter pushed past him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a rolling-pin at it and shouted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) began going down the stairs, supporting himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) right hand against the wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went down and out into the yard.
<p/>There, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale and horror-stricken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) looked wildly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood still before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>There was a look of poignant agony, of despair, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hands. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) lips worked in an ugly, meaningless smile.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stood still a minute, grinned and went back to the police office. Ilya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers.
<p/>Before him (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs. '' Hulloa! Back again! have you left something behind?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) walked right to the table, leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) hand on it, tried to say something, but could not; only incoherent sounds were audible.
<p/>What's the matter? '' Raskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came slowly nearer. '' You are feeling ill, a chair!
<p/>Raskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes fixed on the face of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed unpleasant surprise.
<p/>Here, sit down! Some water! '' Both looked at one another for a minute and waited. Water was brought. '' It was I...'' began Raskolnikov.
<p/>Raskolnikov refused the water with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) hand, and softly and brokenly, but distinctly said: '' It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drink some water. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ilya Petrovitch</b></font>)</div>Ilya Petrovitch opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovitch</b></font>) mouth. People ran up on all sides. Raskolnikov repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) statement. EPILOGUE I Siberia.
<p/>On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town, one of the administrative centres of Russia; in the town there is a fortress, in the fortress there is a prison.
<p/>In the prison the second-class convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months. Almost a year and a half has passed since his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) crime.
<p/>There had been little difficulty about his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) trial. The criminal adhered exactly, firmly, and clearly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) statement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not confuse nor misrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own interest, nor omit the smallest detail.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) explained every incident of the murder, the secret of the pledge -LRB-the piece of wood with a strip of metal-RRB- which was found in the murdered woman's hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) described minutely how he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its contents; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) explained the mystery of Lizaveta's murder; described how Koch and, after him (<font color='blue'><b>Koch</b></font>), the student knocked, and repeated all they had said to one another; how he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay and Dmitri shouting; how he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards gone home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.
<p/>The lawyers and the judges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making use of them, and that, what was more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) did not now remember what the trinkets were like, or even how many there were.
<p/>The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed incredible.
<p/>The whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks.
<p/>They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man should tell a lie about this, when about everything else he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made a truthful and straightforward confession.
<p/>Finally some of the lawyers more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had really not looked into the purse, and so didn't know what was in it when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hid it under the stone.
<p/>But they immediately drew the deduction that the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental derangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of gain.
<p/>This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary insanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases.
<p/>Moreover Raskolnikov's hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by Dr. Zossimov, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) former fellow students, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) landlady and her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) servant.
<p/>All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not quite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another element in the case.
<p/>From being so long under the stone, some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the damp. To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself.
<p/>To the decisive question as to what motive impelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to the murder and the robbery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) miserable position, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) poverty and helplessness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) desire to provide for his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) first steps in life by the help of the three thousand roubles he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had reckoned on finding.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been led to the murder through his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by privation and failure. To the question what led him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to confess, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) answered that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heartfelt repentance.
<p/>The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected, perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself, but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) guilt.
<p/>All this was almost coarse.... All the strange and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration. There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition of the criminal at the time.
<p/>The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) had made no use of what he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime.
<p/>Incidentally the murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man commits two murders and forgets that the door is open!
<p/>Finally, the confession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism, and when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no suspicions even -LRB-Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word-RRB---all this did much to soften the sentence.
<p/>Razumihin somehow discovered and proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had helped a poor consumptive fellow student and had spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) last penny on supporting him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit old father whom he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had maintained almost from his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) thirteenth year, Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) funeral when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) died.
<p/>Raskolnikov's landlady bore witness, too, that when they had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so.
<p/>Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner's favour came out quite unexpectedly. This was investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses.
<p/>And in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a term of eight years only.
<p/>These facts made an impression in his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) favour. At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov's mother fell ill. Dounia and Razumihin found it possible to get her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) out of Petersburg during the trial.
<p/>Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible.
<p/>Pulcheria Alexandrovna's illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial derangement of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) intellect. When Dounia returned from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) last interview with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother already ill, in feverish delirium.
<p/>Razumihin and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) agreed what answers they must make to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's questions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's benefit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) having to go away to a distant part of Russia on a business commission, which would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in the end money and reputation.
<p/>But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never asked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter.
<p/>On the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own version of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son's sudden departure; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told them with tears how he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had come to say good-bye to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), hinting that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya had many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to be in hiding.
<p/>As for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) future career, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) assured Razumihin that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son would be one day a great statesman, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) article and brilliant literary talent proved it.
<p/>This article she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was continually reading, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) even read it aloud, almost took it to bed with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was obviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suspicions.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not, for instance, complain of getting no letters from him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>), though in previous years she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had only lived on the hope of letters from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) beloved Rodya.
<p/>This was the cause of great uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother suspected that there was something terrible in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son's fate and was afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful.
<p/>That evening They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna's strange silence on certain subjects. In any case, Dounia saw clearly that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother was not in full possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) faculties.
<p/>It happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) without mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and suspicious answers she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood lasted for a long time.
<p/>Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that the poor mother suspected something terrible.
<p/>Dounia remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother's telling her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother had overheard her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) talking in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sleep on the night after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the fatal day of the confession: had not she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made out something from that?
<p/>Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be succeeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would begin to talk almost incessantly of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hopes of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) future....
<p/>They humoured her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), pretended to agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw perhaps that they were pretending-RRB-, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) still went on talking.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fancies were sometimes very strange. Five months after Raskolnikov's confession, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was sentenced. Razumihin and Sonia saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in prison as often as it was possible.
<p/>At last the moment of separation came. Dounia swore to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) brother that the separation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same.
<p/>Razumihin, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving up a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in every natural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital.
<p/>There they would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would begin a new life. They all wept at parting.
<p/>Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked a great deal about his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother and was constantly anxious about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) worried so much about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that it alarmed Dounia. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heard about his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother's illness he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) became very gloomy.
<p/>With the help of the money left to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) by Svidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) preparations to follow the party of convicts in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was despatched to Siberia.
<p/>With Sonia he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was particularly reserved all the time. Not a word passed between Raskolnikov and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) on the subject, but both knew it would be so.
<p/>At the final leave-taking he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) smiled strangely at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sister's and Razumihin's fervent anticipations of their happy future together when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) should come out of prison.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) predicted that their mother's illness would soon have a fatal ending. Sonia and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) at last set off. Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin.
<p/>It was a quiet and sorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however. During all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.
<p/>Dounia put implicit faith in his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) plans and indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could not but believe in him (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) displayed a rare strength of will.
<p/>Among other things he (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) began attending university lectures again in order to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Razumihin</b></font>) degree. They were continually making plans for the future; both counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least.
<p/>Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) blessing to Dounia's marriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) became even more melancholy and anxious.
<p/>To give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) pleasure Razumihin told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) how Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) decrepit father and how a year ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been burnt and injured in rescuing two little children from a fire.
<p/>Till then they rested their hopes on Sonia. These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria Alexandrovna's disordered imagination almost to ecstasy.
<p/>In public conveyances and shops, wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) could capture a listener, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) would begin the discourse about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) son, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) article, how he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had helped the student, how he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had been burnt at the fire, and so on!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was continually talking about them, even entering into conversation with strangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>). Dounia did not know how to restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>Apart from the danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) morbid excitement, there was the risk of someone's recalling Raskolnikov's name and speaking of the recent trial.
<p/>Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the address of the mother of the two children her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son had saved and insisted on going to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>At last her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) restlessness reached an extreme point. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would sometimes begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious.
<p/>One morning she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) declared that by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remembered when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said good-bye to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began to prepare for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) coming, began to do up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) room for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), to clean the furniture, to wash and put up new hangings and so on.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said that they must expect him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) back in nine months. Dounia was anxious, but said nothing and helped her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to arrange the room.
<p/>After a fatiguing day spent in continual fancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was taken ill in the night and by morning she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was feverish and delirious.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) delirium she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dropped words which showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew a great deal more about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son's terrible fate than they had supposed.
<p/>For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mother's death, though a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) reached Siberia.
<p/>It was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month to the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity.
<p/>At first they found Sonia's letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate brother's life.
<p/>Sonia's letters were full of the most matter-of-fact detail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov's surroundings as a convict.
<p/>It was brain fever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) died within a fortnight. There was no word of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) own hopes, no conjecture as to the future, no description of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) feelings.
<p/>Instead of any attempt to interpret his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) state of mind and inner life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) gave the simple facts--that is, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) own words, an exact account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) health, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked for at their interviews, what commission he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and so on.
<p/>All these facts she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) gave with extraordinary minuteness. The picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness and precision.
<p/>There could be no mistake, because nothing was given but facts. But Dounia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) husband could get little comfort out of the news, especially at first.
<p/>Sonia wrote that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was constantly sullen and not ready to talk, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) scarcely seemed interested in the news she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) from their letters, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sometimes asked after his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother and that when, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had guessed the truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at last of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was surprised to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not seem greatly affected by it, not externally at any rate.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told them that, although he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off from everyone--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took a very direct and simple view of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) new life; that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) understood his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) position, expected nothing better for the time, had no ill-founded hopes -LRB-as is so common in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) position-RRB- and scarcely seemed surprised at anything in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) surroundings, so unlike anything he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had known before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wrote that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) health was satisfactory; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) work without shirking or seeking to do more; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was almost indifferent about food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that at last he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been glad to accept some money from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Sonia, to have his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own tea every day.
<p/>Sonia wrote further that in prison he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shared the same room with the rest, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) slept on a plank bed with a rug under him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and was unwilling to make any other arrangement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) not to trouble about anything else, declaring that all this fuss about him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) only annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). But that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply from inattention and indifference.
<p/>Sonia wrote simply that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had at first shown no interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) visits, had almost been vexed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and rude to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>But that in the end these visits had become a habit and almost a necessity for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was positively distressed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was ill for some days and could not visit him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) used to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was brought for a few minutes to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>On working days she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) would go to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the sheds on the banks of the Irtish.
<p/>About herself, Sonia wrote that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had succeeded in making some acquaintances in the town, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) did sewing, and, as there was scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was looked upon as an indispensable person in many houses.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) did not mention that the authorities were, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), interested in Raskolnikov; that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) task was lightened and so on.
<p/>At last the news came -LRB-Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and uneasiness in the preceding letters-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) held aloof from everyone, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) fellow prisoners did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) kept silent for days at a time and was becoming very pale.
<p/>In the last letter Sonia wrote that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of the hospital.
<p/>But it was not the horrors of prison life, not the hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothes that crushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>II He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was ill a long time. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) care for all those trials and hardships! he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was even glad of the hard work.
<p/>Physically exhausted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could at least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep. And what was the food to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>)--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it?
<p/>In the past as a student he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had often not had even that. His (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) clothes were warm and suited to his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) manner of life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) did not even feel the fetters. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) shaven head and parti-coloured coat? Before whom? Before Sonia?
<p/>Sonia was afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) , how could he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) be ashamed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>)? And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was ashamed even before Sonia, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) tortured because of it with his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) contemptuous rough manner.
<p/>But it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) shaven head and his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) fetters he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was ashamed of: his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) pride had been stung to the quick.
<p/>It was wounded pride that made him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) ill. Oh, how happy he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) would have been if he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) could have blamed himself!
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) judged himself severely, and his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) exasperated conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) past, except a simple blunder which might happen to anyone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was ashamed just because he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>), Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief through some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to <div class="bookquote">``the idiocy''  (<font color='red'><b>Raskolnikov/Mr. Raskolnikov</b></font>)</div>of a sentence, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) were anyhow to be at peace.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could have borne anything then, even shame and disgrace. Vague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future a continual sacrifice leading to nothing
<p/>And what comfort was it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) that at the end of eight years he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life!
<p/>--that was all that lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>). What had he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to live for? What had he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to look forward to? Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) strive?
<p/>Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had been ready a thousand times before to give up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for a fancy.
<p/>Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) desires that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others.
<p/>And if only fate would have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) repentance--burning repentance that would have torn his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart and robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) of sleep, that repentance, the awful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning!
<p/>To live in order to exist? Mere existence had always been too little for him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had always wanted more. Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would have been glad of it!
<p/>At least he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) might have found relief in raging at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stupidity, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to prison.
<p/>But now in prison, in freedom , he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought over and criticised all his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque as they had seemed at the fatal time.
<p/>In what way,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) asked himself, <div class="bookquote">``was my theory stupider than others that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world?
<p/>One has only to look at the thing quite independently, broadly, and uninfluenced by commonplace ideas, and my idea will by no means seem so... strange.
<p/>Tears and agonies would at least have been life. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) did not repent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) crime. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Oh, sceptics and halfpenny philosophers, why do you halt half-way!
<p/>'' Why does my action strike them as so horrible? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) said to himself. '' Is it because it was a crime?
<p/>What is meant by crime? My conscience is at rest. Of course, it was a legal crime, of course, the letter of the law was broken and blood was shed.
<p/>Of course, in that case many of the benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps.
<p/>Well, punish me for the letter of the law... and that's enough. But those men succeeded and so they were right , and I didn't,
<p/>It was only in that that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) recognised his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) criminality, only in the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had been unsuccessful and had confessed it.
<p/>and so I had no right to have taken that step. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) suffered too from the question: why had he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) not killed himself?
<p/>Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stood looking at the river and preferred to confess? Was the desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it?
<p/>In misery he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) asked himself this question, and could not understand that, at the very time he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had been standing looking into the river, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) convictions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) didn't understand that that consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) future resurrection.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could not step over, again through weakness and meanness.
<p/>Had not Svidrigaïlov overcome it, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) was afraid of death? He (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and prized it.
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Svidrigaïlov</b></font>) that they loved and valued life more in prison than in freedom. What terrible agonies and privations some of them, the tramps for instance, had endured!
<p/>Could they care so much for a ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden away in some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and longed to see again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) might to see his (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) sweetheart, dreaming of the green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush?
<p/>In prison, of course, there was a great deal he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) did not see and did not want to see; he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) lived as it were with downcast eyes.
<p/>But in the end there was much that surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much that he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) had not suspected before.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) went on he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) saw still more inexplicable examples. It was loathsome and unbearable for him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) to look. What surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) most of all was the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) and all the rest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) felt and knew the reasons of his (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) isolation, but he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) would never have admitted till then that those reasons were so deep and strong.
<p/>They seemed to be a different species, and he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) looked at them and they at him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) with distrust and hostility. There were some Polish exiles, political prisoners, among them.
<p/>They simply looked down upon all the rest as ignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the Poles.
<p/>There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous, a former officer and two seminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) at last--why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not tell. Men who had been far more guilty despised and laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) crime.
<p/>'' You're a gentleman,'' they used to say. '' You shouldn't hack about with an axe; that's not a gentleman's work.
<p/>'' The second week in Lent, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turn came to take the sacrament with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gang. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went to church and prayed with the others.
<p/>A quarrel broke out one day, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not know how. All fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) at once in a fury. ''
<p/>You're an infidel! You don't believe in God,'' they shouted. '' You ought to be killed. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had never talked to them about God nor his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) belief, but they wanted to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as an infidel.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in a perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) calmly and silently; his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyebrows did not quiver, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) face did not flinch.
<p/>The guard succeeded in intervening between him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) assailant, or there would have been bloodshed. There was another question he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not decide: why were they all so fond of Sonia?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) did not try to win their favour; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) rarely met them, sometimes only she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) at work for a moment.
<p/>And yet everybody knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), they knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had come out to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) , knew how and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) lived.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) never gave them money, did them no particular services. Only once at Christmas she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) sent them all presents of pies and rolls.
<p/>But by degrees closer relations sprang up between them and Sonia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) would write and post letters for them to their relations.
<p/>Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their instructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wives and sweethearts knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and used to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) visited Raskolnikov at work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, they all took off their hats to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>).
<p/>'' Little mother Sofya Semyonovna, you are our dear, good little mother,'' coarse branded criminals said to that frail little creature.
<p/>They even admired her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gait and turned round to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) walking; they admired her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) too for being so little, and, in fact, did not know what to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) most for.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would smile and bow to them and everyone was delighted when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smiled. They even came to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for help in their illnesses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter. When he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was better, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) remembered the dreams he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had had while he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was feverish and delirious.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of Asia.
<p/>All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts of microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were endowed with intelligence and will.
<p/>Men attacked by them became at once mad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers
<p/>, never had they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their moral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples went mad from the infection.
<p/>Each thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) alone had the truth and was wretched looking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hands.
<p/>They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom to justify.
<p/>They gathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march the armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken and the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting and devouring each other.
<p/>The alarm bell was ringing all day long in the towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was summoning them no one knew.
<p/>All were excited and did not understand one another. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. The most ordinary trades were abandoned, because everyone proposed his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own ideas, his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own improvements, and they could not agree.
<p/>Men met in groups, agreed on something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something quite different from what they had proposed.
<p/>The land too was abandoned. They accused one another, fought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All men and all things were involved in destruction.
<p/>They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and a new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these men, no one had heard their words and their voices.
<p/>Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) memory so miserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.
<p/>The plague spread and moved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole world. The second week after Easter had come.
<p/>Sonia had only been able to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) twice during his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) illness; each time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had to obtain permission, and it was difficult.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) often used to come to the hospital yard, especially in the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the windows of the ward.
<p/>There were warm bright spring days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel paced were opened. One evening, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep.
<p/>On waking up he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the distance at the hospital gate.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) seemed to be waiting for someone. Something stabbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) to the heart at that minute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) shuddered and moved away from the window.
<p/>Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day after; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) uneasily. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was discharged.
<p/>On reaching the prison he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) learnt from the convicts that Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.
<p/>Hearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was anxious about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>), Sonia sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) a pencilled note, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was much better, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had a slight cold and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) would soon, very soon come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) work.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) soon learnt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) illness was not dangerous. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) heart throbbed painfully as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) read it.
<p/>Early in the morning, at six o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) went off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed.
<p/>One of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and laying it in the kiln.
<p/>Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the wide deserted river.
<p/>From the high bank a broad landscape opened before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>), the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.
<p/>Again it was a warm bright day. There were only three of them sent. In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could just see, like black specks, the nomads' tents.
<p/>There there was freedom, there other men were living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand still, as though the age of Abraham and his (<font color='blue'><b>Abraham</b></font>) flocks had not passed.
<p/>Raskolnikov sat gazing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thoughts passed into day-dreams, into contemplation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>).
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) found Sonia beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had come up noiselessly and sat down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) side. It was still quite early; the morning chill was still keen.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) poor old burnous and the green shawl; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and paler.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was always timid of holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would repel it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) always took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hand as though with repugnance, always seemed vexed to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) visit.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) hand with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) usual timidity. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) trembled before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) and went away deeply grieved.
<p/>But now their hands did not part. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) stole a rapid glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) and dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) eyes on the ground without speaking.
<p/>They were alone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time. How it happened he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) did not know.
<p/>But all at once something seemed to seize him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) and fling him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) wept and threw his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) knees.
<p/>For the first instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was terribly frightened and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) turned pale. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) jumped up and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) trembling. But at the same moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) knew and had no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) beyond everything and that at last the moment had come.... They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes.
<p/>They were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life.
<p/>They were renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other. They resolved to wait and be patient.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had risen again and he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) knew it and felt it in all his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) being, while she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) only lived in his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) life.
<p/>On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked, Raskolnikov lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) plank bed and thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had even fancied that day that all the convicts who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) enemies looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) differently; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had even entered into talk with them and they answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) in a friendly way.
<p/>They had another seven years to wait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them! He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered that now, and thought it was bound to be so.
<p/>Wasn't everything now bound to be changed? He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered how continually he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had tormented her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) and wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) pale and thin little face. But these recollections scarcely troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) knew with what infinite love he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) would now repay all her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) sufferings.
<p/>Everything, even his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) crime, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) sentence and imprisonment, seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) now in the first rush of feeling an external, strange fact with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) had no concern.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not think for long together of anything that evening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) could not have analysed anything consciously; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) was simply feeling.
<p/>And what were all, all the agonies of the past! Life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Under his (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) pillow lay the New Testament. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raskolnikov</b></font>) took it up mechanically. The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had read the raising of Lazarus to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>).
<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) was afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) would worry him (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) with books.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) for it himself not long before his (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) illness and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) the book without a word.
<p/>But to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) great surprise she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) had not once approached the subject and had not even offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) the Testament. Till now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) had not opened it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) did not open it now, but one thought passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) mind: <div class="bookquote">``Can her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) convictions not be mine now? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) feelings, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) aspirations at least...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was taken ill again. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) was almost frightened of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sonia</b></font>) happiness.
<p/>At the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready to look on those seven years as though they were seven days.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) did not know that the new life would not be given him (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) for nothing, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) great striving, great suffering.
<p/>But that is the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gradual regeneration, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passing from one world into another, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) initiation into a new unknown life.
