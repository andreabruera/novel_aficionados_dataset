$siddhartha$ is novel by hermann hesse that deals with the spiritual journey of self discovery of #man# named $siddhartha$ during the #time# of the gautama $buddha$
the book hesse ninth novel was written in german in simple lyrical style it was published in the s in and became influential during the
the word $siddhartha$ is made up of two words in sanskrit language siddha achieved artha what was searched for which together means he who has found meaning of existence or he who has attained his goals
hesse dedicated the first part of it to romain rolland and the second part to wilhelm gundert his cousin in fact the $buddha$ own name before his renunciation was $siddhartha$ gautama prince of kapilavastu
$siddhartha$ decides to leave behind his home in the hope of gaining spiritual illumination by becoming an ascetic wandering beggar of the $samanas$
joined by his best friend $govinda$ $siddhartha$ fasts becomes homeless renounces all personal possessions and intensely meditates eventually seeking and personally speaking with gautama the famous $buddha$ or enlightened one
in this book the $buddha$ is referred to as $gotama$ the story takes place in the nepalese district of kapilavastu afterward both $siddhartha$ and $govinda$ acknowledge the elegance of the $buddha$ #teaching#
although $govinda$ hastily joins the $buddha$ order $siddhartha$ does not follow claiming that the $buddha$ philosophy though supremely wise does not account for the necessarily distinct experiences of each person
he argues that the individual seeks an absolutely unique personal meaning that cannot be presented to him by teacher he thus resolves to carry on his quest alone
siddartha crosses river and the generous ferryman whom $siddhartha$ is unable to pay merrily predicts that $siddhartha$ will return to the river later to compensate him in some way
$kamala$ courtesan notes $siddhartha$ handsome appearance and fast wit telling him that he must become wealthy to win her affections so that she may teach him the art of love
venturing onward toward city life $siddhartha$ discovers $kamala$ the most beautiful woman he has yet seen although $siddhartha$ despised materialistic pursuits as shramana he agrees now to $kamala$ suggestions
she directs him to the employ of $kamaswami$ local businessman and insists that he have $kamaswami$ treat him as an equal rather than an underling
$siddhartha$ easily succeeds providing #voice# of patience and tranquility which $siddhartha$ learned from his #day# as an ascetic against $kamaswami$ fits of passion
thus $siddhartha$ becomes rich #man# and $kamala$ lover though in his middle years he realizes that the luxurious lifestyle he has chosen is merely game that lacks spiritual fulfillment
leaving the fast paced bustle of the city $siddhartha$ returns to the river fed up with life and disillusioned contemplating suicide before falling into meditative sleep and is saved only by an internal experience of the holy word om
the very next morning $siddhartha$ briefly reconnects with $govinda$ who is passing through the area as wandering buddhist $siddhartha$ decides to live the rest of his life in the presence of the spiritually inspirational river
although $vasudeva$ is simple #man# he understands and relates that the river has many #voice# and significant messages to divulge to any who might listen
some years later $kamala$ now buddhist convert is traveling to see the $buddha$ at his deathbed accompanied by her reluctant young son when she is bitten by venomous snake near $siddhartha$ river
$siddhartha$ thus reunites with the ferryman named $vasudeva$ with whom he begins humbler way of life $siddhartha$ recognizes her and realizes that the boy is his own child
although $siddhartha$ is desperate to find his runaway son $vasudeva$ urges him to let the boy find his own path much like $siddhartha$ did himself in his youth
listening to the river with $vasudeva$ $siddhartha$ realizes that #time# is an illusion and that all of his feelings and experiences even those of suffering are part of great and ultimately jubilant fellowship of all things connected in the cyclical unity of nature
after $siddhartha$ moment of illumination $vasudeva$ claims that his work is done and he must depart into the woods leaving $siddhartha$ peacefully fulfilled and alone once more
toward the end of his life $govinda$ hears about an enlightened ferryman and travels to $siddhartha$ not initially recognizing him as his old childhood friend
$govinda$ asks the now elderly $siddhartha$ to relate his wisdom and $siddhartha$ replies that for every true statement there is an opposite one that is also true that language and the confines of #time# lead people to adhere to one fixed belief that does not account for the fullness of the truth
after $kamala$ death $siddhartha$ attempts to console and raise the furiously resistant boy until one #day# the child flees altogether because nature works in self sustaining cycle every entity carries in it the potential for its opposite
and so the world must always be considered complete $siddhartha$ simply urges people to identify and love the world in its completeness
$siddhartha$ then requests that $govinda$ kiss his forehead and when he does $govinda$ experiences the visions of timelessness that $siddhartha$ himself saw with $vasudeva$ by the river
$govinda$ bows to his wise friend and $siddhartha$ smiles radiantly having found enlightenment $govinda$ friend and follower of gautama siddartha #father# brahmin who was unable to satisfy $siddhartha$ quest for enlightenment
the $samanas$ traveling ascetics who tell $siddhartha$ that deprivation leads to enlightenment gautama the $buddha$ whose #teaching# are rejected but whose power of self experience and self wisdom is completely praised by $siddhartha$
$kamala$ courtesan and $siddhartha$ sensual mentor mother of his child young $siddhartha$ $kamaswami$ merchant who instructs $siddhartha$ on business $vasudeva$ an enlightened ferryman and spiritual guide of $siddhartha$
in hesse novel experience the totality of conscious events of human life is shown as the best way to approach understanding of reality and attain enlightenment hesse crafting of $siddhartha$ journey shows that understanding is attained not through intellectual methods nor through immersing oneself in the carnal pleasures of the world and the accompanying pain of samsara
young siddartha son of $siddhartha$ and $kamala$ lives with $siddhartha$ for #time# but runs away to adan it is the completeness of these experiences that allows $siddhartha$ to attain understanding
thus the individual events are meaningless when considered by themselves $siddhartha$ stay with the shramanas and his immersion in the worlds of love and business do not lead to nirvana yet they cannot be considered distractions for every action and event gives $siddhartha$ experience which leads to understanding
a major preoccupation of hesse in writing $siddhartha$ was to cure his sickness with life lebenskrankheit by immersing himself in indian philosophy such as that expounded in the upanishads and the bhagavad gita
the reason the second half of the book took so long to write was that hesse had not experienced that transcendental state of unity to which $siddhartha$ aspires
in an attempt to do so hesse lived as virtual semi recluse and became totally immersed in the sacred #teaching# of both hindu and buddhist scriptures
the novel is structured on three of the traditional stages of life for hindu males student brahmacharin householder grihastha and recluse renunciate vanaprastha as well as the $buddha$ four noble truths part one and eight fold path part two which form twelve chapters the number in the novel
$siddhartha$ does not in the end learn true wisdom from any teacher but from river that roars in funny way and from kindly old fool who always smiles and is secretly saint
in lecture about $siddhartha$ hesse claimed $buddha$ way to salvation has often been criticized and doubted because it is thought to be wholly grounded in cognition
true but it not just intellectual cognition not just learning and knowing but spiritual experience that can be earned only through strict discipline in selfless life
freedman also points out how $siddhartha$ described hesse interior dialectic all of the contrasting poles of his life were sharply etched the restless departures and the search for stillness at home the diversity of experience and the harmony of unifying spirit the security of religious dogma and the anxiety of freedom
eberhard ostermann has shown how hesse while mixing the religious genre of the legend with that of the modern novel seeks to reconcile with the double edged effects of modernization such as individualization pluralism or self disciplining
his intention was to attain to that completeness which in the novel is the $buddha$ badge of distinction a film version entitled $siddhartha$ was released in
it stars shashi kapoor and was directed by conrad rooks in a surrealistic adaptation as musical western was released as zachariah
john rubinstein starred in the title role and george englund was the director don johnson played matthew the equivalent of $govinda$
