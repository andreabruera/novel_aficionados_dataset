<p/>In the shade of the house, in the sunshine of the riverbank near the boats, in the shade of the Sal-wood forest, in the shade of the fig tree is where Siddhartha grew up, the handsome son of the Brahman, the young falcon, together with his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) friend Govinda, son of a Brahman.
<p/>The sun tanned his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) light shoulders by the banks of the river when bathing, performing the sacred ablutions, the sacred offerings.
<p/>In the mango grove, shade poured into his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) black eyes, when playing as a boy, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mother sang, when the sacred offerings were made, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father, the scholar, taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), when the wise men talked.
<p/>For a long time, Siddhartha had been partaking in the discussions of the wise men, practising debate with Govinda, practising with Govinda the art of reflection, the service of meditation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) already knew how to speak the Om silently, the word of words, to speak it silently into himself while inhaling, to speak it silently out of himself while exhaling, with all the concentration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) soul, the forehead surrounded by the glow of the clear-thinking spirit.
<p/>Joy leapt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) father's heart for his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) son who was quick to learn, thirsty for knowledge; he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) growing up to become great wise man and priest, a prince among the Brahmans.
<p/>Bliss leapt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) mother's breast when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) walking, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bliss</b></font>) sit down and get up, Siddhartha, strong, handsome, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) who was walking on slender legs, greeting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with perfect respect.
<p/>Love touched the hearts of the Brahmans' young daughters when Siddhartha walked through the lanes of the town with the luminous forehead, with the eye of a king, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) slim hips.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) already knew to feel Atman in the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) being, indestructible, one with the universe. But more than all the others he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was loved by Govinda, his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) friend, the son of a Brahman.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) loved Siddhartha's eye and sweet voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) walk and the perfect decency of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) movements, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) loved everything Siddhartha did and said and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) loved most was his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) spirit, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) transcendent, fiery thoughts, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) ardent will, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) high calling.
<p/>Govinda knew: he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) would not become a common Brahman, not a lazy official in charge of offerings; not a greedy merchant with magic spells; not a vain, vacuous speaker; not a mean, deceitful priest; and also not a decent, stupid sheep in the herd of the many.
<p/>No, and he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), Govinda, as well did not want to become one of those, not one of those tens of thousands of Brahmans.
<p/>And in days to come, when Siddhartha would become a god, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) would join the glorious, then Govinda wanted to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) friend, his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) companion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) servant, his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) spear-carrier, his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) shadow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) wanted to follow Siddhartha, the beloved, the splendid. Siddhartha was thus loved by everyone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was a source of joy for everybody, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was a delight for them all.
<p/>Walking the rosy paths of the fig tree garden, sitting in the bluish shade of the grove of contemplation, washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) limbs daily in the bath of repentance, sacrificing in the dim shade of the mango forest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) gestures of perfect decency, everyone's love and joy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) still lacked all joy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Dreams and restless thoughts came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mind, flowing from the water of the river, sparkling from the stars of the night, melting from the beams of the sun, dreams came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) and a restlessness of the soul, fuming from the sacrifices, breathing forth from the verses of the Rig-Veda, being infused into him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), drop by drop, from the teachings of the old Brahmans.
<p/>Siddhartha had started to nurse discontent in himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had started to feel that the love of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father and the love of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mother, and also the love of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) friend, Govinda, would not bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) joy for ever and ever, would not nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), feed him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had started to suspect that his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) venerable father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) other teachers, that the wise Brahmans had already revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) the most and best of their wisdom, that they had already filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) expecting vessel with their richness, and the vessel was not full, the spirit was not content, the soul was not calm, the heart was not satisfied.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), Siddhartha, was not a source of joy for himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) found no delight in himself. The ablutions were good, but they were water
<p/>, they did not wash off the sin, they did not heal the spirit's thirst, they did not relieve the fear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart.
<p/>The sacrifices and the invocation of the gods were excellent--but was that all? Did the sacrifices give a happy fortune? And what about the gods?
<p/>Was it really Prajapati who had created the world? Was it not the Atman, He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), the only one, the singular one?
<p/>Were the gods not creations, created like me and you, subject to time, mortal? Was it therefore good , was it right, was it meaningful and the highest occupation to make offerings to the gods?
<p/>For whom else were offerings to be made, who else was to be worshipped but Him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), the only one, the Atman?
<p/>And where was Atman to be found, where did He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) reside, where did his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eternal heart beat, where else but in one's own self, in its innermost part, in its indestructible part, which everyone had in himself?
<p/>But where, where was this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part? It was not flesh and bone, it was neither thought nor consciousness, thus the wisest ones taught.
<p/>So, where, where was it? To reach this place, the self, myself, the Atman, there was another way, which was worthwhile looking for?
<p/>Alas, and nobody showed this way, nobody knew it, not the father, and not the teachers and wise men, not the holy sacrificial songs!
<p/>They knew everything, the Brahmans and their holy books, they knew everything, they had taken care of everything and of more than everything, the creation of the world, the origin of speech, of food, of inhaling, of exhaling, the arrangement of the senses, the acts of the gods, they knew infinitely much--but was it valuable to know all of this, not knowing that one and only thing, the most important thing, the solely important thing?
<p/>Surely, many verses of the holy books, particularly in the Upanishades of Samaveda, spoke of this innermost and ultimate thing, wonderful verses.
<p/>Your soul is the whole world'', was written there, and it was written that man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleep, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deep sleep, would meet with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) innermost part and would reside in the Atman.
<p/>Marvellous wisdom was in these verses, all knowledge of the wisest ones had been collected here in magic words, pure as honey collected by bees.
<p/>No, not to be looked down upon was the tremendous amount of enlightenment which lay here collected and preserved by innumerable generations of wise Brahmans.--
<p/>But where were the Brahmans, where the priests, where the wise men or penitents, who had succeeded in not just knowing this deepest of all knowledge but also to live it?
<p/>Where was the knowledgeable one who wove his (<font color='blue'><b>penitents</b></font>) spell to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>penitents</b></font>) familiarity with the Atman out of the sleep into the state of being awake, into the life, into every step of the way, into word and deed?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>penitents</b></font>) father was to be admired, quiet and noble were his (<font color='blue'><b>penitents</b></font>) manners, pure his (<font color='blue'><b>penitents</b></font>) life, wise his (<font color='blue'><b>penitents</b></font>) words, delicate and noble thoughts lived behind its brow
<p/>'' Siddhartha knew many venerable Brahmans, chiefly his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father, the pure one, the scholar, the most venerable one. --but even he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), who knew so much, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) live in blissfulness,
<p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) not, again and again, have to drink from holy sources, as a thirsty man, from the offerings, from the books, from the disputes of the Brahmans?
<p/>Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), the irreproachable one, have to wash off sins every day, strive for a cleansing every day, over and over every day?
<p/>did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have peace, was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not also just a searching man, a thirsty man? Was not Atman in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), did not the pristine source spring from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart?
<p/>It had to be found, the pristine source in one's own self, it had to be possessed! Everything else was searching, was a detour, was getting lost.
<p/>Thus were Siddhartha's thoughts, this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thirst, this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) suffering. Often he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) spoke to himself from a Chandogya-Upanishad the words:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly, the name of the Brahman is satyam--verily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) who knows such a thing, will enter the heavenly world every day.
<p/>Often, it seemed near, the heavenly world, but never he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had reached it completely, never he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had quenched the ultimate thirst.
<p/>And among all the wise and wisest men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) knew and whose instructions he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had received, among all of them there was no one, who had reached it completely, the heavenly world, who had quenched it completely, the eternal thirst.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Govinda,'' Siddhartha spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) friend, <div class="bookquote">``Govinda, my dear, come with me under the Banyan tree, let's practise meditation.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>They went to the Banyan tree, they sat down, Siddhartha right here, Govinda twenty paces away. While putting himself down, ready to speak the Om, Siddhartha repeated murmuring the verse:
<p/>Om is the bow, the arrow is soul, The Brahman is the arrow's target, That one should incessantly hit. After the usual time of the exercise in meditation had passed, Govinda rose.
<p/>Siddhartha sat there lost in thought, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes were rigidly focused towards a very distant target, the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) tongue was protruding a little between the teeth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) seemed not to breathe.
<p/>The evening had come, it was time to perform the evening's ablution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) called Siddhartha's name. Siddhartha did not answer. Thus sat he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), wrapped up in contemplation, thinking Om, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) soul sent after the Brahman as an arrow.
<p/>Once, Samanas had travelled through Siddhartha's town, ascetics on a pilgrimage, three skinny, withered men, neither old nor young, with dusty and bloody shoulders, almost naked, scorched by the sun, surrounded by loneliness, strangers and enemies to the world, strangers and lank jackals in the realm of humans.
<p/>In the evening, after the hour of contemplation, Siddhartha spoke to Govinda: <div class="bookquote">``Early tomorrow morning, my friend, Siddhartha will go to the Samanas.
<p/>Govinda turned pale, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) heard these words and read the decision in the motionless face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) friend, unstoppable like the arrow shot from the bow.
<p/>Behind them blew a hot scent of quiet passion, of destructive service, of merciless self-denial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) will become a Samana.''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>Soon and with the first glance, Govinda realized:
<p/>Now it is beginning, now Siddhartha is taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) own way, now his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) fate is beginning to sprout, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), my own.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) turned pale like a dry banana-skin. '' O Siddhartha,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``will your father permit you to do that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Siddhartha looked over as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was just waking up. Arrow-fast he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) read in Govinda's soul, read the fear, read the submission.
<p/>'' O Govinda,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) spoke quietly, <div class="bookquote">``let's not waste words. Tomorrow, at daybreak I will begin the life of the Samanas.
<p/>Siddhartha entered the chamber, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father was sitting on a mat of bast, and stepped behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father and remained standing there, until his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father felt that someone was standing behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>Speak no more of it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Quoth the Brahman: <div class="bookquote">``Is that you, Siddhartha? Then say what you came to say. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Brahman</b></font>)</div><p/>Quoth Siddhartha: <div class="bookquote">``With your permission, my father. I came to tell you that it is my longing to leave your house tomorrow and go to the ascetics.
<p/>The Brahman fell silent, and remained silent for so long that the stars in the small window wandered and changed their relative positions, `ere the silence was broken.
<p/>Silent and motionless stood the son with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) arms folded, silent and motionless sat the father on the mat, and the stars traced their paths in the sky.
<p/>My desire is to become a Samana. May my father not oppose this. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Quoth Siddhartha father</b></font>)</div>Then spoke the father: <div class="bookquote">``Not proper it is for a Brahman to speak harsh and angry words.
<p/>But indignation is in my heart. I wish not to hear this request for a second time from your mouth. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><p/>Slowly, the Brahman rose; Siddhartha stood silently, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) arms folded. '' What are you waiting for?'' asked the father. Quoth Siddhartha:
<p/>After an hour, since no sleep had come over his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes, the Brahman stood up, paced to and fro, and left the house.
<p/>Through the small window of the chamber he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) looked back inside, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw Siddhartha standing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) arms folded, not moving from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) spot.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>Indignant, the father left the chamber; indignant, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bed and lay down. Pale shimmered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bright robe.
<p/>After another hour, since no sleep had come over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes, the Brahman stood up again, paced to and fro, walked out of the house and saw that the moon had risen.
<p/>Through the window of the chamber he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked back inside; there stood Siddhartha, not moving from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) spot, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) arms folded, moonlight reflecting from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) bare shins.
<p/>With anxiety in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart, the father returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bed. With worry in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart, the father went back to bed.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came back after an hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came back after two hours, looked through the small window, saw Siddhartha standing, in the moon light, by the light of the stars, in the darkness.
<p/>, silently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) looked into the chamber, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) standing in the same place, filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart with anger, filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart with unrest, filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart with anguish, filled it with sadness.
<p/>And in the night's last hour, before the day began, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) returned, stepped into the room, saw the young man standing there, who seemed tall and like a stranger to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) came back hour after hour '' Siddhartha,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">``what are you waiting for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know what. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you always stand that way and wait, until it'll becomes morning, noon, and evening?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will stand and wait. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>You will become tired, Siddhartha.'' <div class="bookquote">``I will become tired.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will fall asleep, Siddhartha.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will not fall asleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will die, Siddhartha.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will die.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>'' And would you rather die, than obey your father?'' <div class="bookquote">``Siddhartha has always obeyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' So will you abandon your plan?'' <div class="bookquote">``Siddhartha will do what his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The first light of day shone into the room.
<p/>The Brahman saw that Siddhartha was trembling softly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) knees. In Siddhartha's face he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw no trembling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes were fixed on a distant spot.
<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father realized that even now Siddhartha no longer dwelt with him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) home, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had already left him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>The Father touched Siddhartha's shoulder. '' You will,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">``go into the forest and be a Samana. When you'll have found blissfulness in the forest, then come back and teach me to be blissful.
<p/>If you'll find disappointment, then return and let us once again make offerings to the gods together. Go now and kiss your mother, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) where you are going to.
<p/>But for me it is time to go to the river and to perform the first ablution. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hand from the shoulder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son and went outside.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) limbs back under control, bowed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father, and went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mother to do as his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father had said.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) slowly left on stiff legs in the first light of day the still quiet town, a shadow rose near the last hut, who had crouched there, and joined the pilgrim--Govinda.
<p/>Siddhartha wavered to the side, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) tried to walk. '' You have come,'' said Siddhartha and smiled. '' I have come,'' said Govinda.
<p/>In the evening of this day they caught up with the ascetics, the skinny Samanas, and offered them their companionship and--obedience.
<p/>WITH THE SAMANAS They were accepted. Siddhartha gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) garments to a poor Brahman in the street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wore nothing more than the loincloth and the earth-coloured, unsown cloak.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) ate only once a day, and never something cooked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) fasted for fifteen days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) fasted for twenty-eight days. The flesh waned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thighs and cheeks.
<p/>Feverish dreams flickered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) enlarged eyes, long nails grew slowly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) parched fingers and a dry, shaggy beard grew on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) chin.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) glance turned to ice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) encountered women; his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mouth twitched with contempt, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) walked through a city of nicely dressed people.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw merchants trading, princes hunting, mourners wailing for their dead, whores offering themselves, physicians trying to help the sick, priests determining the most suitable day for seeding, lovers loving, mothers nursing their children--and all of this was not worthy of one look from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eye, it all lied, it all stank, it all stank of lies, it all pretended to be meaningful and joyful and beautiful, and it all was just concealed putrefaction.
<p/>A goal stood before Siddhartha, a single goal: to become empty, empty of thirst, empty of wishing, empty of dreams, empty of joy and sorrow.
<p/>Dead to himself, not to be a self any more, to find tranquility with an emptied heart, to be open to miracles in unselfish thoughts, that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) goal.
<p/>Once all of my self was overcome and had died, once every desire and every urge was silent in the heart, then the ultimate part of me had to awake, the innermost of my being, which is no longer my self, the great secret.
<p/>Silently, Siddhartha exposed himself to burning rays of the sun directly above, glowing with pain, glowing with thirst, and stood there, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) neither felt any pain nor thirst any more.
<p/>Silently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) stood there in the rainy season, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hair the water was dripping over freezing shoulders, over freezing hips and legs, and the penitent stood there, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could not feel the cold in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) shoulders and legs any more, until they were silent, until they were quiet.
<p/>Silently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) cowered in the thorny bushes, blood dripped from the burning skin, from festering wounds dripped pus, and Siddhartha stayed rigidly, stayed motionless, until no blood flowed any more, until nothing stung any more, until nothing burned any more.
<p/>The world tasted bitter. Life was torture. Siddhartha sat upright and learned to breathe sparingly, learned to get along with only few breathes, learned to stop breathing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) learned, beginning with the breath, to calm the beat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart, leaned to reduce the beats of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart, until they were only a few and almost none.
<p/>A heron flew over the bamboo forest--and Siddhartha accepted the heron into his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) soul, flew over forest and mountains, was a heron, ate fish, felt the pangs of a heron's hunger, spoke the heron's croak, died a heron's death.
<p/>A dead jackal was lying on the sandy bank, and Siddhartha's soul slipped inside the body, was the dead jackal, lay on the banks, got bloated, stank, decayed, was dismembered by hyaenas, was skinned by vultures, turned into a skeleton, turned to dust, was blown across the fields.
<p/>And Siddhartha's soul returned, had died, had decayed, was scattered as dust, had tasted the gloomy intoxication of the cycle, awaited in new thirst like a hunter in the gap, where he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) could escape from the cycle, where the end of the causes, where an eternity without suffering began.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) killed his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) senses, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) killed his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) memory, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) slipped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) self into thousands of other forms, was an animal, was carrion, was stone, was wood, was water, and awoke every time to find his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) old self again, sun shone or moon, was his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) self again, turned round in the cycle, felt thirst, overcame the thirst, felt new thirst.
<p/>Siddhartha learned a lot when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was with the Samanas, many ways leading away from the self he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) learned to go.
<p/>Instructed by the oldest of the Samanas, Siddhartha practised self-denial, practised meditation, according to a new Samana rules. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) went the way of self-denial by means of pain, through voluntarily suffering and overcoming pain, hunger, thirst, tiredness.
<p/>These and other ways he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) learned to go, a thousand times he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) self, for hours and days he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) remained in the non-self.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) went the way of self-denial by means of meditation, through imagining the mind to be void of all conceptions. But though the ways led away from the self, their end nevertheless always led back to the self.
<p/>Though Siddhartha fled from the self a thousand times, stayed in nothingness, stayed in the animal, in the stone, the return was inevitable, inescapable was the hour, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) found himself back in the sunshine or in the moonlight, in the shade or in the rain, and was once again his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) self and Siddhartha, and again felt the agony of the cycle which had been forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>By his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) side lived Govinda, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) shadow, walked the same paths, undertook the same efforts. They rarely spoke to one another, than the service and the exercises required.
<p/>Occasionally the two of them went through the villages, to beg for food for themselves and their teachers. '' How do you think, Govinda,'' Siddhartha spoke one day while begging this way, <div class="bookquote">``how do you think did we progress?
<p/>Did we reach any goals?''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Govinda answered: <div class="bookquote">``We have learned, and we'll continue learning. You'll be a great Samana, Siddhartha. Quickly, you've learned every exercise, often the old Samanas have admired you.
<p/>One day, you'll be a holy man, oh Siddhartha. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>Quoth Siddhartha: <div class="bookquote">``I can't help but feel that it is not like this, my friend.
<p/>What I've learned, being among the Samanas, up to this day, this, oh Govinda, I could have learned more quickly and by simpler means.
<p/>In every tavern of that part of a town where the whorehouses are, my friend, among carters and gamblers I could have learned it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Quoth Siddhartha friend</b></font>)</div>Quoth Govinda: <div class="bookquote">``Siddhartha is putting me on. How could you have learned meditation, holding your breath, insensitivity against hunger and pain there among these wretched people?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div><p/>And Siddhartha said quietly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was talking to himself: <div class="bookquote">``What is meditation? What is leaving one's body? What is fasting?
<p/>It is fleeing from the self, it is a short escape of the agony of being a self, it is a short numbing of the senses against the pain and the pointlessness of life.
<p/>The same escape, the same short numbing is what the driver of an ox-cart finds in the inn, drinking a few bowls of rice-wine or fermented coconut-milk.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) won't feel his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) self any more, then he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) won't feel the pains of life any more, then he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) finds a short numbing of the senses.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) falls asleep over his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) bowl of rice-wine, he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)'ll find the same what Siddhartha and Govinda find when they escape their bodies through long exercises, staying in the non-self.
<p/>What is holding one's breath? This is how it is, oh Govinda. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Quoth Govinda: <div class="bookquote">``You say so, oh friend, and
<p/>It's true that a drinker numbs his (<font color='blue'><b>drinker</b></font>) senses, it's true that he (<font color='blue'><b>drinker</b></font>) briefly escapes and rests, but he (<font color='blue'><b>drinker</b></font>)'ll return from the delusion, finds everything to be unchanged, has not become wiser, has gathered no enlightenment,--has not risen several steps.
<p/>yet you know that Siddhartha is no driver of an ox-cart and a Samana is no drunkard. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>And Siddhartha spoke with a smile: ``I do not know, I've never been a drunkard.
<p/>But that I, Siddhartha, find only a short numbing of the senses in my exercises and meditations and that I am just as far removed from wisdom, from salvation, as a child in the mother's womb, this I know, oh
<p/>And once again, another time, when Siddhartha left the forest together with Govinda, to beg for some food in the village for their brothers and teachers, Siddhartha began to speak and said: <div class="bookquote">``What now, oh Govinda, might we be on the right path?
<p/>Govinda, this I know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Might we get closer to enlightenment? Might we get closer to salvation? Or do we perhaps live in a circle--
<p/>we, who have thought we were escaping the cycle? '' Quoth Govinda: <div class="bookquote">``We have learned a lot, Siddhartha, there is still much to learn.
<p/>We are not going around in circles, we are moving up, the circle is a spiral, we have already ascended many a level.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha answered: <div class="bookquote">``How old, would you think, is our oldest Samana, our venerable teacher? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Quoth Govinda: <div class="bookquote">``Our oldest one might be about sixty years of age.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>)'ll turn seventy and eighty, and you and me, we will grow just as old and will do our exercises, and will fast, and will meditate.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>And Siddhartha: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has lived for sixty years and has not reached the nirvana. But we will not reach the nirvana, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) won't and we won't.
<p/>Oh Govinda, I believe out of all the Samanas out there, perhaps not a single one, not a single one, will reach the nirvana.
<p/>We find comfort , we find numbness, we learn feats, to deceive others. But the most important thing, the path of paths, we will not find.
<p/>How could it be that among so many learned men, among so many Brahmans, among so many austere and venerable Samanas, among so many who are searching, so many who are eagerly trying, so many holy men, no one will find the path of paths?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div><p/>But Siddhartha said in a voice which contained just as much sadness as mockery, with a quiet, a slightly sad, a slightly mocking voice: <div class="bookquote">``Soon, Govinda, your friend will leave the path of the Samanas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) has walked along your side for so long.
<p/>I'm suffering of thirst, oh Govinda, and on this long path of a Samana, my thirst has remained as strong as ever.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>'' If you only,'' spoke Govinda, ``wouldn't speak such terrible words, Siddhartha! I always thirsted for knowledge, I have always been full of questions.
<p/>I have asked the Brahmans, year after year, and I have asked the holy Vedas, year after year, and I have asked the devote Samanas, year after year.
<p/>Perhaps, oh Govinda, it had been just as well, had been just as smart and just as profitable, if I had asked the hornbill-bird or the chimpanzee.
<p/>It took me a long time and am not finished learning this yet, oh Govinda: that there is nothing to be learned!
<p/>There is, oh my friend, just one knowledge, this is everywhere, this is Atman, this is within me and within you and within every creature.
<p/>And so I'm starting to believe that this knowledge has no worser enemy than the desire to know it, than learning.
<p/>At this, Govinda stopped on the path, rose his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) hands, and spoke: <div class="bookquote">``If you, Siddhartha, only would not bother your friend with this kind of talk!
<p/>There is indeed no such thing, so I believe, as what we refer to as `learning'. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>Truly, you words stir up fear in my heart.
<p/>And just consider: what would become of the sanctity of prayer, what of the venerability of the Brahmans' caste, what of the holiness of the Samanas, if it was as you say, if there was no learning?!
<p/>What, oh Siddhartha, what would then become of all of this what is holy, what is precious, what is venerable on earth?!
<p/>And Govinda mumbled a verse to himself, a verse from an Upanishad: He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) who ponderingly, of a purified spirit, loses himself in the meditation of Atman, unexpressable by words is his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) blissfulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) heart.
<p/>'' But Siddhartha remained silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought about the words which Govinda had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) and thought the words through to their end.
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) thought, standing there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) head low, what would remain of all that which seemed to us to be holy?
<p/>At one time, when the two young men had lived among the Samanas for about three years and had shared their exercises, some news, a rumour, a myth reached them after being retold many times: A man had appeared, Gotama by name, the exalted one, the Buddha, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) had overcome the suffering of the world in himself and had halted the cycle of rebirths.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) was said to wander through the land, teaching, surrounded by disciples, without possession, without home, without a wife, in the yellow cloak of an ascetic, but with a cheerful brow, a man of bliss, and Brahmans and princes would bow down before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and would become his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) students.
<p/>This myth, this rumour, this legend resounded, its fragrants rose up, here and there; in the towns, the Brahmans spoke of it and in the forest, the Samanas; again and again, the name of Gotama, the Buddha reached the ears of the young men, with good and with bad talk, with praise and with defamation.
<p/>It was as if the plague had broken out in a country and news had been spreading around that in one or another place there was a man, a wise man, a knowledgeable one, whose word and breath was enough to heal everyone who had been infected with the pestilence, and as such news would go through the land and everyone would talk about it, many would believe, many would doubt, but many would get on their way as soon as possible, to seek the wise man, the helper, just like this this myth ran through the land, that fragrant myth of Gotama, the Buddha, the wise man of the family of Sakya.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) possessed, so the believers said, the highest enlightenment, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) previous lives, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had reached the nirvana and never returned into the cycle, was never again submerged in the murky river of physical forms.
<p/>Many wonderful and unbelievable things were reported of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had performed miracles, had overcome the devil, had spoken to the gods.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) enemies and disbelievers said, this Gotama was a vain seducer, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) would spent his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) days in luxury, scorned the offerings, was without learning, and knew neither exercises nor self-castigation.
<p/>What remains? What can stand the test? And he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) head. The myth of Buddha sounded sweet. The scent of magic flowed from these reports.
<p/>After all, the world was sick, life was hard to bear--and behold, here a source seemed to spring forth, here a messenger seemed to call out, comforting, mild, full of noble promises.
<p/>Everywhere where the rumour of Buddha was heard, everywhere in the lands of India, the young men listened up, felt a longing, felt hope, and among the Brahmans' sons of the towns and villages every pilgrim and stranger was welcome, when he (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) brought news of him (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>), the exalted one, the Sakyamuni.
<p/>The myth had also reached the Samanas in the forest, and also Siddhartha, and also Govinda, slowly, drop by drop, every drop laden with hope, every drop laden with doubt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had heard that this alleged Buddha used to be an ascetic before and had lived in the forest, but had then turned back to luxury and worldly pleasures, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) had no high opinion of this Gotama.
<p/>They rarely talked about it, because the oldest one of the Samanas did not like this myth. '' Oh Siddhartha,'' Govinda spoke one day to his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) friend. ''
<p/>Today, I was in the village, and a Brahman invited me into his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) house, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) house, there was the son of a Brahman from Magadha, who has seen the Buddha with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) own eyes and has heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) teach.
<p/>If only I would too, if only we both would too, Siddhartha and me, live to see the hour when we will hear the teachings from the mouth of this perfected man!
<p/>Verily, this made my chest ache when I breathed, and thought to myself: Speak, friend, wouldn't we want to go there too and listen to the teachings from the Buddha's mouth?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Always, oh Govinda, I had thought, Govinda would stay with the Samanas, always I had believed his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) goal was to live to be sixty and seventy years of age and to keep on practising those feats and exercises, which are becoming a Samana.
<p/>So now you, my faithful friend, want to take a new path and go there, where the Buddha spreads his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) teachings.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Quoth Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Quoth Siddhartha: But behold, I had not known Govinda well enough, I knew little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) heart. '' Quoth Govinda: <div class="bookquote">``You're mocking me.
<p/>And have you not at one time said to me, you would not walk the path of the Samanas for much longer?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div><p/>At this, Siddhartha laughed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) very own manner, in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) voice assumed a touch of sadness and a touch of mockery, and said: <div class="bookquote">``Well, Govinda, you've spoken well, you've remembered correctly.
<p/>If you only remembered the other thing as well, you've heard from me, which is that I have grown distrustful and tired against teachings and learning, and that my faith in words, which are brought to us by teachers, is small.
<p/>But let's do it, my dear, I am willing to listen to these teachings--though in my heart I believe that we've already tasted the best fruit of these teachings.
<p/>Mock me if you like, Siddhartha! But have you not also developed a desire, an eagerness, to hear these teachings? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div><p/>Quoth Govinda: <div class="bookquote">``Your willingness delights my heart. But tell me, how should this be possible? How should the Gotama's teachings, even before we have heard them, have already revealed their best fruit to us?
<p/>But this fruit, which we already now received thanks to the Gotama, consisted in him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) calling us away from the Samanas!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>Quoth Siddhartha: <div class="bookquote">``Let us eat this fruit and wait for the rest, oh Govinda! Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) has also other and better things to give us, oh friend, let us await with calm hearts.
<p/>On this very same day, Siddhartha informed the oldest one of the Samanas of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) decision, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wanted to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>But the Samana became angry, because the two young men wanted to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and talked loudly and used crude swearwords.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Quoth Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) informed the oldest one with all the courtesy and modesty becoming to a younger one and a student. Govinda was startled and became embarrassed.
<p/>But Siddhartha put his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mouth close to Govinda's ear and whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Now, I want to show the old man that I've learned something from him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>).
<p/>Positioning himself closely in front of the Samana, with a concentrated soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) captured the old man's glance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) glances, deprived him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) power, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) mute, took away his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) free will, subdued him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) own will, commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), to do silently, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) demanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) to do.
<p/>The old man became mute, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes became motionless, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will was paralysed, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms were hanging down; without power, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had fallen victim to Siddhartha's spell.
<p/>And thus, the old man made several bows, performed gestures of blessing, spoke stammeringly a godly wish for a good journey.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But Siddhartha's thoughts brought the Samana under their control, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had to carry out, what they commanded. And the young men returned the bows with thanks, returned the wish, went on their way with salutations.
<p/>On the way, Govinda said: <div class="bookquote">``Oh Siddhartha, you have learned more from the Samanas than I knew. It is hard , it is very hard to cast a spell on an old Samana.
<p/>Truly, if you had stayed there, you would soon have learned to walk on water.''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do not seek to walk on water,''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>said Siddhartha.
<p/>In the town of Savathi, every child knew the name of the exalted Buddha, and every house was prepared to fill the alms-dish of Gotama's disciples, the silently begging ones.
<p/>Near the town was Gotama's favourite place to stay, the grove of Jetavana, which the rich merchant Anathapindika, an obedient worshipper of the exalted one, had given him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) people for a gift.
<p/>All tales and answers, which the two young ascetics had received in their search for Gotama's abode, had pointed them towards this area.
<p/>And arriving at Savathi, in the very first house, before the door of which they stopped to beg, food has been offered to them, and they accepted the food, and Siddhartha asked the woman, who handed them the food: <div class="bookquote">``We would like to know, oh charitable one, where the Buddha dwells, the most venerable one, for we are two Samanas from the forest and have come, to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>),
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Let old Samanas be content with such feats! '' GOTAMA the perfected one, and to hear the teachings from his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>'' Quoth the woman: <div class="bookquote">``Here, you have truly come to the right place, you Samanas from the forest. You should know, in Jetavana, in the garden of Anathapindika is where the exalted one dwells.
<p/>There you pilgrims shall spent the night, for there is enough space for the innumerable, who flock here, to hear the teachings from his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) mouth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>This made Govinda happy, and full of joy he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``Well so, thus we have reached our destination, and our path has come to an end!
<p/>But tell us, oh mother of the pilgrims, do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), the Buddha, have you seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) with your own eyes?
<p/>On many days, I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>), walking through the alleys in silence, wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) yellow cloak, presenting his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) alms-dish in silence at the doors of the houses, leaving with a filled dish.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Quoth the woman: <div class="bookquote">``Many times I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>), the exalted one. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Delightedly, Govinda listened and wanted to ask and hear much more.
<p/>They thanked and left and hardly had to ask for directions, for rather many pilgrims and monks as well from Gotama's community were on their way to the Jetavana.
<p/>And since they reached it at night, there were constant arrivals, shouts, and talk of those who sought shelter and got it.
<p/>The two Samanas, accustomed to life in the forest, found quickly and without making any noise a place to stay and rested there until the morning.
<p/>But Siddhartha urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to walk on. At sunrise, they saw with astonishment what a large crowd of believers and curious people had spent the night here.
<p/>On all paths of the marvellous grove, monks walked in yellow robes, under the trees they sat here and there, in deep contemplation--or in a conversation about spiritual matters, the shady gardens looked like a city, full of people, bustling like bees.
<p/>The majority of the monks went out with their alms-dish, to collect food in town for their lunch, the only meal of the day.
<p/>The Buddha himself, the enlightened one, was also in the habit of taking this walk to beg in the morning. Siddhartha saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) instantly recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), as if a god had pointed him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) out to him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), a simple man in a yellow robe, bearing the alms-dish in his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) hand, walking silently. <div class="bookquote">``Look here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha said quietly to Govinda.
<p/>Attentively, Govinda looked at the monk in the yellow robe, who seemed to be in no way different from the hundreds of other monks.
<p/>'' This one is the Buddha. '' And soon, Govinda also realized: This is the one. And they followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) and observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>).
<p/>The Buddha went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) way, modestly and deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) thoughts, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) calm face was neither happy nor sad, it seemed to smile quietly and inwardly.
<p/>With a hidden smile, quiet, calm, somewhat resembling a healthy child, the Buddha walked, wore the robe and placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) feet just as all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) monks did, according to a precise rule.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) face and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) walk, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) quietly lowered glance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) quietly dangling hand and even every finger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) quietly dangling hand expressed peace, expressed perfection, did not search, did not imitate, breathed softly in an unwhithering calm, in an unwhithering light, an untouchable peace.
<p/>Thus Gotama walked towards the town, to collect alms, and the two Samanas recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) solely by the perfection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) calm, by the quietness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) appearance, in which there was no searching, no desire,
<p/>no imitation, no effort to be seen, only light and peace. '' Today, we'll hear the teachings from his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) mouth.'' said Govinda.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) felt little curiosity for the teachings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) did not believe that they would teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) anything new, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had, just as Govinda had, heard the contents of this Buddha's teachings again and again, though these reports only represented second- or third-hand information.
<p/>But attentively he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) looked at Gotama's head, his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) shoulders, his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) feet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) quietly dangling hand, and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) as if every joint of every finger of this hand was of these teachings, spoke of, breathed of, exhaled the fragrant of, glistened of truth.
<p/>Siddhartha did not answer. This man, this Buddha was truthful down to the gesture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) last finger. This man was holy.
<p/>Never before, Siddhartha had venerated a person so much, never before he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had loved a person as much as this one.
<p/>They both followed the Buddha until they reached the town and then returned in silence, for they themselves intended to abstain from on this day.
<p/>They saw Gotama returning--what he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) ate could not even have satisfied a bird's appetite, and they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) retiring into the shade of the mango-trees.
<p/>But in the evening, when the heat cooled down and everyone in the camp started to bustle about and gathered around, they heard the Buddha teaching.
<p/>They heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) voice, and it was also perfected, was of perfect calmness, was full of peace. Gotama taught the teachings of suffering, of the origin of suffering, of the way to relieve suffering.
<p/>Suffering was life, full of suffering was the world, but salvation from suffering had been found: salvation was obtained by him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) who would walk the path of the Buddha.
<p/>With a soft, yet firm voice the exalted one spoke, taught the four main doctrines, taught the eightfold path, patiently he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) went the usual path of the teachings, of the examples, of the repetitions, brightly and quietly his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) voice hovered over the listeners, like a light, like a starry sky.
<p/>When the Buddha--night had already fallen--ended his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) speech, many a pilgrim stepped forward and asked to accepted into the community, sought refuge in the teachings.
<p/>Calmly and clearly his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) quiet speech flowed on. And Gotama accepted them by speaking: ``You have heard the teachings well, it has come to you well.
<p/>Behold, then Govinda, the shy one, also stepped forward and spoke: <div class="bookquote">``I also take my refuge in the exalted one and his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) teachings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) asked to accepted into the community of his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) disciples and was accepted.
<p/>Right afterwards, when the Buddha had retired for the night, Govinda turned to Siddhartha and spoke eagerly: <div class="bookquote">``Siddhartha, it is not my place to scold you.
<p/>Thus join us and walk in holiness, to put an end to all suffering. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>We have both heard the exalted one, we have both perceived the teachings.
<p/>Govinda has heard the teachings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) has taken refuge in it. But you, my honoured friend, don't you also want to walk the path of salvation?
<p/>Would you want to hesitate, do you want to wait any longer?'' Siddhartha awakened as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had been asleep, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heard Govinda's words.
<p/>For a long time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) looked into Govinda's face. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) spoke quietly, in a voice without mockery: <div class="bookquote">``Govinda, my friend, now you have taken this step, now you have chosen this path.
<p/>Often I have thought: Won't Govinda for once also take a step by himself, without me, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) own soul?
<p/>Always, oh Govinda, you've been my friend, you've always walked one step behind me. Behold, now you've turned into a man and are choosing your path for yourself.
<p/>I wish that you would go it up to its end, oh my friend, that you shall find salvation!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Govinda, not completely understanding it yet, repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) question in an impatient tone: <div class="bookquote">``Speak up, I beg you, my dear!
<p/>Tell me, since it could not be any other way, that you also, my learned friend, will take your refuge with the exalted Buddha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div><p/>Siddhartha placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hand on Govinda's shoulder: <div class="bookquote">``You failed to hear my good wish for you, oh Govinda. I'm repeating it: I wish that you would go this path up to its end, that you shall find salvation!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div><p/>In this moment, Govinda realized that his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) friend had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) started to weep. <div class="bookquote">``Siddhartha! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) exclaimed lamentingly.
<p/>Siddhartha kindly spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Don't forget, Govinda, that you are now one of the Samanas of the Buddha! You have renounced your home and your parents, renounced your birth and possessions, renounced your free will, renounced all friendship.
<p/>This is what the teachings require, this is what the exalted one wants. This is what you wanted for yourself. Tomorrow, oh Govinda, I'll leave you.
<p/>For a long time, the friends continued walking in the grove; for a long time, they lay there and found no sleep.
<p/>And over and over again, Govinda urged his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) should tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) would not want to seek refuge in Gotama's teachings, what fault he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) would find in these teachings.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But Siddhartha turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) away every time and said: <div class="bookquote">``Be content, Govinda! Very good are the teachings of the exalted one, how could I find a fault in them?
<p/>Very early in the morning, a follower of Buddha, one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) oldest monks, went through the garden and called all those to him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) who had as novices taken their refuge in the teachings, to dress them up in the yellow robe and to instruct them in the first teachings and duties of their position.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then Govinda broke loose, embraced once again his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) childhood friend and left with the novices. But Siddhartha walked through the grove, lost in thought.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) happened to meet Gotama, the exalted one, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) with respect and the Buddha's glance was so full of kindness and calm, the young man summoned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) courage and asked the venerable one for the permission to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Silently the exalted one nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) approval. Quoth Siddhartha: <div class="bookquote">``Yesterday, oh exalted one, I had been privileged to hear your wondrous teachings.
<p/>Together with my friend, I had come from afar, to hear your teachings. And now my friend is going to stay with your people, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has taken his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) refuge with you.
<p/>Too bold is my speech,''  (<font color='red'><b>Quoth Siddhartha Yesterday</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha continued, <div class="bookquote">``but I do not want to leave the exalted one without having honestly told him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) my thoughts.
<p/>But I will again start on my pilgrimage. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>'' As you please,'' the venerable one spoke politely. '' Does it please the venerable one to listen to me for one moment longer?''
<p/>Silently, the Buddha nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) approval. Quoth Siddhartha: ``One thing, oh most venerable one, I have admired in your teachings most of all.
<p/>Everything in your teachings is perfectly clear, is proven; you are presenting the world as a perfect chain, a chain which is never and nowhere broken, an eternal chain the links of which are causes and effects.
<p/>Never before, this has been seen so clearly; never before, this has been presented so irrefutably; truly, the heart of every Brahman has to beat stronger with love, once he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has seen the world through your teachings perfectly connected, without gaps, clear as a crystal, not depending on chance, not depending on gods.
<p/>Whether it may be good or bad, whether living according to it would be suffering or joy, I do not wish to discuss, possibly this is not essential--but the uniformity of the world, that everything which happens is connected, that the great and the small things are all encompassed by the same forces of time, by the same law of causes, of coming into being and of dying, this is what shines brightly out of your exalted teachings, oh perfected one.
<p/>But according to your very own teachings, this unity and necessary sequence of all things is nevertheless broken in one place, through a small gap, this world of unity is invaded by something alien, something new, something which had not been there before, and which cannot be demonstrated and cannot be proven: these are your teachings of overcoming the world, of salvation.
<p/>But with this small gap, with this small breach, the entire eternal and uniform law of the world is breaking apart again and becomes void.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>alien</b></font>) spoke, the perfected one, with his (<font color='blue'><b>alien</b></font>) kind, with his (<font color='blue'><b>alien</b></font>) polite and clear voice: <div class="bookquote">``You've heard the teachings, oh son of a Brahman, and good for you that you've thought about it thus deeply.
<p/>Please forgive me for expressing this objection. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Quietly, Gotama had listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), unmoved. You've found a gap in it, an error.
<p/>You should think about this further. But be warned, oh seeker of knowledge, of the thicket of opinions and of arguing about words.
<p/>There is nothing to opinions, they may be beautiful or ugly, smart or foolish, everyone can support them or discard them.
<p/>But the teachings, you've heard from me, are no opinion, and their goal is not to explain the world to those who seek knowledge.
<p/>They have a different goal; their goal is salvation from suffering. This is what Gotama teaches, nothing else.'' <div class="bookquote">``I wish that you, oh exalted one, would not be angry with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man.
<p/>'' I have not spoken to you like this to argue with you, to argue about words. You are truly right, there is little to opinions.
<p/>I have not doubted for a single moment that you are Buddha, that you have reached the goal, the highest goal towards which so many thousands of Brahmans and sons of Brahmans are on their way.
<p/>But let me say this one more thing: I have not doubted in you for a single moment. You have found salvation from death.
<p/>It has come to you in the course of your own search, on your own path, through thoughts, through meditation, through realizations, through enlightenment.
<p/>It has not come to you by means of teachings! And--thus is my thought, oh exalted one,--nobody will obtain salvation by means of teachings!
<p/>You will not be able to convey and say to anybody, oh venerable one, in words and through teachings what has happened to you in the hour of enlightenment!
<p/>But there is one thing which these so clear, these so venerable teachings do not contain: they do not contain the mystery of what the exalted one has experienced for himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) alone among hundreds of thousands.
<p/>The teachings of the enlightened Buddha contain much, it teaches many to live righteously, to avoid evil. This is what I have thought and realized, when I have heard the teachings.
<p/>This is why I am continuing my travels--not to seek other, better teachings, for I know there are none, but to depart from all teachings and all teachers and to reach my goal by myself or to die.
<p/>But often, I'll think of this day, oh exalted one, and of this hour, when my eyes beheld a holy man.
<p/>I wish,'' the venerable one spoke slowly, <div class="bookquote">``that your thoughts shall not be in error, that you shall reach the goal!
<p/>But tell me: Have you seen the multitude of my Samanas, my many brothers, who have taken refuge in the teachings?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The Buddha's eyes quietly looked to the ground; quietly, in perfect equanimity his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) inscrutable face was smiling. '' And do you believe, oh stranger,
<p/>oh Samana, do you believe that it would be better for them all the abandon the teachings and to return into the life the world and of desires?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Far is such a thought from my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Siddhartha. '' I wish that they shall all stay with the teachings, that they shall reach their goal!
<p/>It is not my place to judge another person's life. Only for myself, for myself alone, I must decide, I must chose, I must refuse.
<p/>If I merely were one of your disciples, oh venerable one, I'd fear that it might happen to me that only seemingly, only deceptively my self would be calm and be redeemed, but that in truth it would live on and grow, for then I had replaced my self with the teachings, my duty to follow you, my love for you, and the community of the monks!
<p/>With half of a smile, with an unwavering openness and kindness, Gotama looked into the stranger's eyes and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) to leave with a hardly noticeable gesture.
<p/>Salvation from the self is what we Samanas search for, oh exalted one. '' '' You are wise, oh Samana. '', the venerable one spoke.
<p/>'' You know how to talk wisely, my friend. Be aware of too much wisdom!'' The Buddha turned away, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) glance and half of a smile remained forever etched in Siddhartha's memory.
<p/>I have never before seen a person glance and smile, sit and walk this way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought; truly, I wish to be able to glance and smile, sit and walk this way, too, thus free, thus venerable, thus concealed, thus open, thus child-like and mysterious.
<p/>Truly, only a person who has succeeded in reaching the innermost part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) self would glance and walk this way.
<p/>Well so, I also will seek to reach the innermost part of my self. I saw a man, Siddhartha thought, a single man, before whom I would have to lower my glance.
<p/>I do not want to lower my glance before any other, not before any other. No teachings will entice me any more, since this man's teachings have not enticed me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has deprived me of my friend, the one who had believed in me and now believes in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), who had been my shadow and is now Gotama's shadow.
<p/>I am deprived by the Buddha, thought Siddhartha, I am deprived, and even more he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has given to me. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has given me Siddhartha, myself.
<p/>When Siddhartha left the grove, where the Buddha, the perfected one, stayed behind, where Govinda stayed behind, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) felt that in this grove his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) past life also stayed behind and parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) pondered deeply, like diving into a deep water he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) let himself sink down to the ground of the sensation, down to the place where the causes lie, because to identify the causes, so it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), is the very essence of thinking, and by this alone sensations turn into realizations and are not lost, but become entities and start to emit like rays of light what is inside of them.
<p/>AWAKENING He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) pondered about this sensation, which filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) completely, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) was slowly walking along. Slowly walking along, Siddhartha pondered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) realized that one thing had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), as a snake is left by its old skin, that one thing no longer existed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), which had accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) throughout his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) youth and used to be a part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>): the wish to have teachers and to listen to teachings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had also left the last teacher who had appeared on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) path, even him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), the highest and wisest teacher, the most holy one, Buddha, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>), had to part with him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>), was not able to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) teachings.
<p/>Slower, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) walked along in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) thoughts and asked himself: <div class="bookquote">``But what is this, what you have sought to learn from teachings and from teachers, and what they, who have taught you much, were still unable to teach you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) was no youth any more, but had turned into a man. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found: ``It was the self, the purpose and essence of which I sought to learn.
<p/>But I was not able to overcome it, could only deceive it, could only flee from it, only hide from it.
<p/>Truly, no thing in this world has kept my thoughts thus busy, as this my very own self, this mystery of me being alive, of me being one and being separated and isolated from all others, of me being Siddhartha!
<p/>It was the self, I wanted to free myself from, which I sought to overcome. And there is no thing in this world I know less about than about me, about Siddhartha!
<p/>Having been pondering while slowly walking along, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) now stopped as these thoughts caught hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and right away another thought sprang forth from these, a new thought, which was: <div class="bookquote">``That I know nothing about myself, that Siddhartha has remained thus alien and unknown to me, stems from one cause, a single cause: I was afraid of myself, I was fleeing from myself!
<p/>I searched Atman, I searched Brahman, I was willing to dissect my self and peel off all of its layers, to find the core of all peels in its unknown interior, the Atman, life, the divine part, the ultimate part.
<p/>Siddhartha opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes and looked around, a smile filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) face and a feeling of awakening from long dreams flowed through him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) head down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) toes.
<p/>And it was not long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) walked again, walked quickly like a man who knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has got to do.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But I have lost myself in the process. '' '' Oh,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought, taking a deep breath, <div class="bookquote">``now I would not let Siddhartha escape from me again!
<p/>No longer, I want to begin my thoughts and my life with Atman and with the suffering of the world. I do not want to kill and dissect myself any longer, to find a secret behind the ruins.
<p/>I want to learn from myself, want to be my student, want to get to know myself, the secret of Siddhartha.
<p/>Neither Yoga-Veda shall teach me any more, nor Atharva-Veda, nor the ascetics, nor any kind of teachings. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) looked around, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was seeing the world for the first time.
<p/>Here was blue, here was yellow, here was green, the sky and the river flowed, the forest and the mountains were rigid, all of it was beautiful, all of it was mysterious and magical, and in its midst was he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), Siddhartha, the awakening one, on the path to himself.
<p/>All of this, all this yellow and blue, river and forest, entered Siddhartha for the first time through the eyes, was no longer a spell of Mara, was no longer the veil of Maya, was no longer a pointless and coincidental diversity of mere appearances, despicable to the deeply thinking Brahman, who scorns diversity, who seeks unity.
<p/>Blue was blue, river was river, and if also in the blue and the river, in Siddhartha, the singular and divine lived hidden, so it was still that very divinity's way and purpose, to be here yellow, here blue, there sky, there forest, and here Siddhartha.
<p/>Beautiful was the world, colourful was the world, strange and mysterious was the world! The purpose and the essential properties were not somewhere behind the things, they were in them, in everything.
<p/>When someone reads a text, wants to discover its meaning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) will not scorn the symbols and letters and call them deceptions, coincidence, and worthless hull, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) will read them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) will study and love them, letter by letter.
<p/>But I, who wanted to read the book of the world and the book of my own being, I have, for the sake of a meaning I had anticipated before I read, scorned the symbols and letters, I called the visible world a deception, called my eyes and my tongue coincidental and worthless forms without substance.
<p/>'' How deaf and stupid have I been! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought, walking swiftly along. '' No, this is over, I have awakened, I have indeed awakened and have not been born before this very day.
<p/>In thinking these thoughts, Siddhartha stopped once again, suddenly, as if there was a snake lying in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) on the path.
<p/>Because suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had also become aware of this: He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), who was indeed like someone who had just woken up or like a new-born baby, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had to start his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life anew and start again at the very beginning.
<p/>the grove of that exalted one, already awakening, already on the path towards himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had every intention, regarded as natural and took for granted, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), after years as an ascetic, would return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) home and his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father.
<p/>But now, only in this moment, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) stopped as if a snake was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) path, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) also awoke to this realization:
<p/>'' When he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had left in this very morning from the grove Jetavana, <div class="bookquote">``But I am no longer the one I was
<p/>, I am no ascetic any more, I am not a priest any more, I am no Brahman any more. Whatever should I do at home and at my father's place?
<p/>Motionless, Siddhartha remained standing there, and for the time of one moment and breath, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart felt cold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt a cold in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) chest, as a small animal, a bird or a rabbit, would when seeing how alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was.
<p/>Study? Make offerings? Practise meditation? But all this is over, all of this is no longer alongside my path. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For many years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had been without home and had felt nothing.
<p/>Still, even in the deepest meditation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father's son, had been a Brahman, of a high caste, a cleric.
<p/>Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt it. Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was nothing but Siddhartha, the awoken one, nothing else was left. Deeply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) inhaled, and for a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt cold and shivered.
<p/>There was no nobleman who did not belong to the noblemen, no worker that did not belong to the workers, and found refuge with them, shared their life, spoke their language.
<p/>No Brahman, who would not be regarded as Brahmans and lived with them, no ascetic who would not find his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) refuge in the caste of the Samanas, and even the most forlorn hermit in the forest was not just one and alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) was also surrounded by a place he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) belonged to, he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) also belonged to a caste, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) was at home.
<p/>Govinda had become a monk, and a thousand monks were his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) brothers, wore the same robe as he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) faith, spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) language.
<p/>Nobody was thus alone as he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) was. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), Siddhartha, where did he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) belong to? With whom would he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) share his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life?
<p/>Out of this moment, when the world melted away all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) stood alone like a star in the sky, out of this moment of a cold and despair, Siddhartha emerged, more a self than before, more firmly concentrated.
<p/>Whose language would he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) speak? He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt: This had been the last tremor of the awakening, the last struggle of this birth.
<p/>And it was not long until he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) walked again in long strides, started to proceed swiftly and impatiently, heading no longer for home, no longer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father, no longer back.
<p/>SECOND PART Dedicated to Wilhelm Gundert, my cousin in Japan KAMALA Siddhartha learned something new on every step of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) path, for the world was transformed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart was enchanted.
<p/>At night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw the stars in the sky in their fixed positions and the crescent of the moon floating like a boat in the blue.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw trees, stars, animals, clouds, rainbows, rocks, herbs, flowers, stream and river, the glistening dew in the bushes in the morning, distant high mountains which were blue and pale, birds sang and bees, wind silverishly blew through the rice-field.
<p/>All of this, a thousand-fold and colourful, had always been there, always the sun and the moon had shone, always rivers had roared and bees had buzzed, but in former times all of this had been nothing more to Siddhartha than a fleeting, deceptive veil before his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes, looked upon in distrust, destined to be penetrated and destroyed by thought, since it was not the essential existence, since this essence lay beyond, on the other side of, the visible.
<p/>But now, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) liberated eyes stayed on this side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw and became aware of the visible, sought to be at home in this world, did not search for the true essence, did not aim at a world beyond.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw the sun rising over the mountains with their forests and setting over the distant beach with its palm-trees. Beautiful was this world, looking at it thus, without searching, thus simply, thus childlike.
<p/>Beautiful were the moon and the stars, beautiful was the stream and the banks, the forest and the rocks, the goat and the gold-beetle, the flower and the butterfly.
<p/>Beautiful and lovely it was, thus to walk through the world, thus childlike, thus awoken, thus open to what is near, thus without distrust.
<p/>Differently the sun burnt the head, differently the shade of the forest cooled him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) down, differently the stream and the cistern, the pumpkin and the banana tasted.
<p/>Short were the days, short the nights, every hour sped swiftly away like a sail on the sea, and under the sail was a ship full of treasures, full of joy.
<p/>Siddhartha saw a group of apes moving through the high canopy of the forest, high in the branches, and heard their savage, greedy song.
<p/>In a lake of reeds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw the pike hungrily hunting for its dinner; propelling themselves away from it, in fear, wiggling and sparkling, the young fish jumped in droves out of the water; the scent of strength and passion came forcefully out of the hasty eddies of the water, which the pike stirred up, impetuously hunting.
<p/>Siddhartha saw a male sheep following a female one and mating with her (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>). All of this had always existed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had not seen it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had not been with it.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was with it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was part of it. Light and shadow ran through his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes, stars and moon ran through his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart.
<p/>On the way, Siddhartha also remembered everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had experienced in the Garden Jetavana, the teaching he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had heard there, the divine Buddha, the farewell from Govinda, the conversation with the exalted one.
<p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) own words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had spoken to the exalted one, every word, and with astonishment he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) became aware of the fact that there he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had said things which he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had not really known yet at this time.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had said to Gotama: his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), the Buddha's, treasure and secret was not the teachings, but the unexpressable and not teachable, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) had experienced in the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) enlightenment--it was nothing but this very thing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) had now gone to experience, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) now began to experience.
<p/>It is true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) had already known for a long time that his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) self was Atman, in its essence bearing the same eternal characteristics as Brahman.
<p/>Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) had to experience his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) self. But never, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) had really found this self, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) had wanted to capture it in the net of thought.
<p/>With the body definitely not being the self, and not the spectacle of the senses, so it also was not the thought, not the rational mind, not the learned wisdom, not the learned ability to draw conclusions and to develop previous thoughts in to new ones.
<p/>No, this world of thought was also still on this side, and nothing could be achieved by killing the random self of the senses, if the random self of thoughts and learned knowledge was fattened on the other hand.
<p/>Both, the thoughts as well as the senses, were pretty things, the ultimate meaning was hidden behind both of them, both had to be listened to, both had to be played with, both neither had to be scorned nor overestimated, from both the secret voices of the innermost truth had to be attentively perceived.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wanted to strive for nothing, except for what the voice commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to strive for, dwell on nothing, except where the voice would advise him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to do so.
<p/>Why had Gotama, at that time, in the hour of all hours, sat down under the bo-tree, where the enlightenment hit him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had heard a voice, a voice in his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own heart, which had commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to seek rest under this tree, and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had neither preferred self-castigation, offerings, ablutions, nor prayer, neither food nor drink, neither sleep nor dream, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had obeyed the voice.
<p/>To obey like this, not to an external command, only to the voice, to be ready like this, this was good, this was necessary, nothing else was necessary.
<p/>In the night when he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) slept in the straw hut of a ferryman by the river, Siddhartha had a dream: Govinda was standing in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), dressed in the yellow robe of an ascetic.
<p/>At this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) embraced Govinda, wrapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) arms around him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) was pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) chest and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), it was not Govinda any more, but a woman, and a full breast popped out of the woman's dress, at which Siddhartha lay and drank, sweetly and strongly tasted the milk from this breast.
<p/>It tasted of woman and man, of sun and forest, of animal and flower, of every fruit, of every joyful desire.
<p/>It intoxicated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unconscious.--When Siddhartha woke up, the pale river shimmered through the door of the hut, and in the forest, a dark call of an owl resounded deeply and pleasantly.
<p/>Sad was how Govinda looked like, sadly he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) asked: Why have you forsaken me? When the day began, Siddhartha asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) host, the ferryman, to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) across the river.
<p/>The ferryman got him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) across the river on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) bamboo-raft, the wide water shimmered reddishly in the light of the morning.
<p/>'' This is a beautiful river,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) companion. '' Yes,'' said the ferryman, <div class="bookquote">``a very beautiful river, I love it more than anything.
<p/>Often I have listened to it, often I have looked into its eyes, and always I have learned from it. Much can be learned from a river.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the ferryman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you, my benefactor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>spoke Siddhartha, disembarking on the other side of the river. '' I have no gift I could give you for your hospitality, my dear, and also no payment for your work.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ferryman</b></font>)</div>spoke the ferryman, <div class="bookquote">``and I haven't expected any payment from you and no gift which would be the custom for guests to bear.
<p/>I am a man without a home, a son of a Brahman and a Samana. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the ferryman</b></font>)</div>You will give me the gift another time.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>asked Siddhartha amusedly. '' Surely. This too, I have learned from the river: everything is coming back!
<p/>You too, Samana, will come back. Now farewell! Let your friendship be my reward. Commemorate me, when you'll make offerings to the gods.
<p/>'' Smiling, they parted. Smiling, Siddhartha was happy about the friendship and the kindness of the ferryman. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is like Govinda,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) thought with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``all I meet on my path are like Govinda.
<p/>All are thankful, though they are the ones who would have a right to receive thanks. All are submissive, all would like to be friends, like to obey, think little.
<p/>In front of the mud cottages, children were rolling about in the street, were playing with pumpkin-seeds and sea-shells, screamed and wrestled, but they all timidly fled from the unknown Samana.
<p/>In the end of the village, the path led through a stream, and by the side of the stream, a young woman was kneeling and washing clothes.
<p/>When Siddhartha greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head and looked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) with a smile, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw the white in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes glistening.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) called out a blessing to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), as it is the custom among travellers, and asked how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) still had to go to reach the large city.
<p/>Like children are all people. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At about noon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) came through a village. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got up and came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), beautifully her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wet mouth was shimmering in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) young face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exchanged humorous banter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), asked whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had eaten already, and whether it was true that the Samanas slept alone in the forest at night and were not allowed to have any women with them.
<p/>While talking, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left foot on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) right one and made a movement as a woman does who would want to initiate that kind of sexual pleasure with a man, which the textbooks call <div class="bookquote">``climbing a tree'' (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>.
<p/>Siddhartha felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) blood heating up, and since in this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) dream again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) bend slightly down to the woman and kissed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) lips the brown nipple of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breast.
<p/>Siddhartha also felt desire and felt the source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) sexuality moving; but since he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had never touched a woman before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hesitated for a moment, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hands were already prepared to reach out for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Looking up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face smiling full of lust and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, with contracted pupils, begging with desire. And in this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heard, shuddering with awe, the voice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) innermost self, and this voice said No.
<p/>Then, all charms disappeared from the young woman's smiling face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) no longer saw anything else but the damp glance of a female animal in heat.
<p/>Politely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) petted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheek, turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and disappeared away from the disappointed woman with light steps into the bamboo-wood.
<p/>On this day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) reached the large city before the evening, and was happy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt the need to be among people.
<p/>For a long time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had lived in the forests, and the straw hut of the ferryman, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had slept that night, had been the first roof for a long time he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has had over his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) head.
<p/>Before the city, in a beautifully fenced grove, the traveller came across a small group of servants, both male and female, carrying baskets.
<p/>In their midst, carried by four servants in an ornamental sedan-chair, sat a woman, the mistress, on red pillows under a colourful canopy.
<p/>Siddhartha stopped at the entrance to the pleasure-garden and watched the parade, saw the servants, the maids, the baskets, saw the sedan-chair and saw the lady in it.
<p/>Under black hair, which made to tower high on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw a very fair, very delicate, very smart face, a brightly red mouth, like a freshly cracked fig, eyebrows which were well tended and painted in a high arch, smart and watchful dark eyes, a clear, tall neck rising from a green and golden garment, resting fair hands, long and thin, with wide golden bracelets over the wrists.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) bowed deeply, when the sedan-chair came closer, and straightening up again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) looked at the fair, charming face, read for a moment in the smart eyes with the high arcs above, breathed in a slight fragrant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) did not know.
<p/>With a smile, the beautiful women nodded for a moment and disappeared into the grove, and then the servant as well.
<p/>Siddhartha saw how beautiful she (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) was, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart rejoiced. Thus I am entering this city, Siddhartha thought, with a charming omen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) instantly felt drawn into the grove, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought about it, and only now he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) became aware of how the servants and maids had looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) at the entrance, how despicable, how distrustful, how rejecting.
<p/>I am still a Samana, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought, I am still an ascetic and beggar. I must not remain like this, I will not be able to enter the grove like this.
<p/>The next person who came along this path he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) asked about the grove and for the name of the woman, and was told that this was the grove of Kamala, the famous courtesan, and that, aside from the grove, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) owned a house in the city.
<p/>Pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) goal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) allowed the city to suck him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) in, drifted through the flow of the streets, stood still on the squares, rested on the stairs of stone by the river.
<p/>When the evening came, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) made friends with barber's assistant, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had seen working in the shade of an arch in a building, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) found again praying in a temple of Vishnu, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vishnu</b></font>) told about stories of Vishnu and the Lakshmi.
<p/>Among the boats by the river, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vishnu</b></font>) slept this night, and early in the morning, before the first customers came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vishnu</b></font>) shop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vishnu</b></font>) had the barber's assistant shave his (<font color='blue'><b>Vishnu</b></font>) beard and cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Vishnu</b></font>) hair, comb his (<font color='blue'><b>Vishnu</b></font>) hair and anoint it with fine oil.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Vishnu</b></font>) laughed. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vishnu</b></font>) entered the city. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Vishnu</b></font>) had a goal. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vishnu</b></font>) went to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Vishnu</b></font>) bath in the river.
<p/>When late in the afternoon, beautiful Kamala approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) grove in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) sedan-chair, Siddhartha was standing at the entrance, made a bow and received the courtesan's greeting.
<p/>But that servant who walked at the very end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) train he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) motioned to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to inform his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) mistress that a young Brahman would wish to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>).
<p/>After a while, the servant returned, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), who had been waiting, to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) conducted him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), who was following him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), without a word into a pavilion, where Kamala was lying on a couch, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>).
<p/>'' Weren't you already standing out there yesterday, greeting me?'' asked Kamala. '' It's true that I've already seen and greeted you yesterday.''
<p/>'' But didn't you yesterday wear a beard, and long hair, and dust in your hair?'' <div class="bookquote">``You have observed well, you have seen everything.
<p/>You have seen Siddhartha, the son of a Brahman, who has left his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) home to become a Samana, and who has been a Samana for three years.
<p/>But now, I have left that path and came into this city, and the first one I met, even before I had entered the city, was you.
<p/>To say this, I have come to you, oh Kamala! You are the first woman whom Siddhartha is not addressing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes turned to the ground.
<p/>Never again I want to turn my eyes to the ground, when I'm coming across a beautiful woman. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Kamala</b></font>)</div>Kamala smiled and played with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) fan of peacocks' feathers.
<p/>And asked: <div class="bookquote">``And only to tell me this, Siddhartha has come to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' To tell you this and to thank you for being so beautiful.
<p/>And if it doesn't displease you, Kamala, I would like to ask you to be my friend and teacher, for I know nothing yet of that art which you have mastered in the highest degree.
<p/>Never before this has happened to me, my friend, that a Samana from the forest came to me and wanted to learn from me!
<p/>Never before this has happened to me, that a Samana came to me with long hair and an old, torn loin-cloth!
<p/>Many young men come to me, and there are also sons of Brahmans among them, but they come in beautiful clothes, they come in fine shoes, they have perfume in their hair and money in their pouches.
<p/>'' At this, Kamala laughed aloud. '' This is, oh Samana, how the young men are like who come to me.
<p/>'' Quoth Siddhartha: <div class="bookquote">``Already I am starting to learn from you. Even yesterday, I was already learning. I have already taken off my beard, have combed the hair, have oil in my hair.
<p/>There is little which is still missing in me, oh excellent one: fine clothes, fine shoes, money in my pouch. You shall know, Siddhartha has set harder goals for himself than such trifles, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has reached them.
<p/>How shouldn't I reach that goal, which I have set for myself yesterday: to be your friend and to learn the joys of love from you!
<p/>You'll see that I'll learn quickly, Kamala, I have already learned harder things than what you're supposed to teach me. And now let's get to it
<p/>: You aren't satisfied with Siddhartha as he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is, with oil in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hair, but without clothes, without shoes, without money?
<p/>Clothes are what he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) must have, pretty clothes, and shoes, pretty shoes, and lots of money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) pouch, and gifts for Kamala.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Quoth Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Laughing, Kamala exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) doesn't satisfy me yet. Do you know it now, Samana from the forest?
<p/>Did you mark my words?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kamala</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, I have marked your words,'' Siddhartha exclaimed. '' How should I not mark words which are coming from such a mouth!
<p/>Your mouth is like a freshly cracked fig, Kamala. My mouth is red and fresh as well, it will be a suitable match for yours,
<p/>see.--But tell me, beautiful Kamala, aren't you at all afraid of the Samana from the forest, who has come to learn how to make love?''
<p/>should I be afraid of a Samana, a stupid Samana from the forest, who is coming from the jackals and doesn't even know yet what women are?''
<p/>you'll '' Whatever for '' Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samana</b></font>)'s strong, the Samana, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Samana</b></font>) isn't afraid of anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samana</b></font>) could force you, beautiful girl.
<p/>Did any Samana or Brahman ever fear, someone might come and grab him (<font color='blue'><b>Samana</b></font>) and steal his (<font color='blue'><b>Samana</b></font>) learning, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samana</b></font>) religious devotion, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samana</b></font>) depth of thought?
<p/>No, for they are his (<font color='blue'><b>Samana</b></font>) very own, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Samana</b></font>) would only give away from those whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Samana</b></font>) is willing to give and to whomever he (<font color='blue'><b>Samana</b></font>) is willing to give.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samana</b></font>) could kidnap you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samana</b></font>) could hurt you.'' <div class="bookquote">``No, Samana, I am not afraid of this. Like this it is, precisely like this it is also with Kamala and with the pleasures of love.
<p/>Beautiful and red is Kamala's mouth, but just try to kiss it against Kamala's will, and you will not obtain a single drop of sweetness from it, which knows how to give so many sweet things!
<p/>You are learning easily, Siddhartha, thus you should also learn this: love can be obtained by begging, buying, receiving it as a gift, finding it in the street, but it cannot be stolen.
<p/>No, it would be a pity, if a pretty young man like you would want to tackle it in such a wrong manner.
<p/>In this, you have come up with the wrong path. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha bowed with a smile. '' It would be a pity, Kamala, you are so right!
<p/>It would be such a great pity. No, I shall not lose a single drop of sweetness from your mouth, nor you from mine!
<p/>So it is settled: Siddhartha will return, once he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)'ll have what he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) still lacks: clothes, shoes, money. But speak, lovely Kamala, couldn't you still give me one small advice?''
<p/>Who wouldn't like to give an advice to a poor, ignorant Samana, who is coming from the jackals of the forest?''
<p/>``An advice? Why not? <div class="bookquote">``Dear Kamala, thus advise me where I should go to, that I'll find these three things most quickly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Friend, many would like to know this. You must do what you've learned and ask for money, clothes, and shoes in return.
<p/>There is no other way for a poor man to obtain money. What might you be able to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can think.
<p/>I can wait. I can fast. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing else?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. But yes, I can also write poetry. Would you like to give me a kiss for a poem?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div><p/>Siddhartha spoke, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had thought about it for a moment, these verses: Into her (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) shady grove stepped the pretty Kamala,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would like to, if I'll like your poem. What would be its title?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kamala</b></font>)</div>At the grove's entrance stood the brown Samana.
<p/>Deeply, seeing the lotus's blossom, Bowed that man, and smiling Kamala thanked. More lovely, thought the young man, than offerings for gods, More lovely is offering to pretty Kamala.
<p/>Kamala loudly clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) hands, so that the golden bracelets clanged. '' Beautiful are your verses, oh brown Samana, and truly, I'm losing nothing when I'm giving you a kiss for them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tilted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head so that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face touched hers and placed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth on that mouth which was like a freshly cracked fig.
<p/>how wise she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) was, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) controlled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), rejected him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), lured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and how after this first one there was to be a long, a well ordered, well tested sequence of kisses, everyone different from the others, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still to receive.
<p/>Breathing deeply, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained standing where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, and was in this moment astonished like a child about the cornucopia of knowledge and things worth learning, which revealed itself before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' For a long time, Kamala kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and with a deep astonishment Siddhartha felt how she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), '' Very beautiful are your verses,'' exclaimed Kamala, <div class="bookquote">``if I was rich, I would give you pieces of gold for them.
<p/>But it will be difficult for you to earn thus much money with verses as you need. For you need a lot of money, if you want to be Kamala's friend.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kamala</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The way you're able to kiss, Kamala!'' stammered Siddhartha. '' Yes, this I am able to do, therefore I do not lack clothes, shoes, bracelets, and all beautiful things.
<p/>But what will become of you? Aren't you able to do anything else but thinking, fasting, making poetry?'' <div class="bookquote">``I also know the sacrificial songs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>said Siddhartha, <div class="bookquote">``but I do not want to sing them any more.
<p/>I also know magic spells, but I do not want to speak them any more. I have read the scriptures-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kamala</b></font>)</div>Kamala interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>'' You're able to read? And write?'' <div class="bookquote">``Certainly, I can do this. Many people can do this.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Most people can't. I also can't do it.
<p/>It is very good that you're able to read and write, very good. You will also still find use for the magic spells.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a maid</b></font>)</div>In this moment, a maid came running in and whispered a message into her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) mistress's ear. '' There's a visitor for me,'' exclaimed Kamala.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurry and get yourself away, Siddhartha, nobody may see you in here, remember this! Tomorrow, I'll see you again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div>But to the maid she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) gave the order to give the pious Brahman white upper garments.
<p/>Without fully understanding what was happening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), Siddhartha found himself being dragged away by the maid, brought into a garden-house avoiding the direct path, being given upper garments as a gift, led into the bushes, and urgently admonished to get himself out of the grove as soon as possible without being seen.
<p/>Being accustomed to the forest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) managed to get out of the grove and over the hedge without making a sound.
<p/>Contently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had been told. Contently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) returned to the city, carrying the rolled up garments under his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) arm.
<p/>At the inn, where travellers stay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) positioned himself by the door, without words he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) asked for food, without a word he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) accepted a piece of rice-cake.
<p/>Perhaps as soon as tomorrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought, I will ask no one for food any more. Suddenly, pride flared up in him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was no Samana any more, it was no longer becoming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to beg. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) gave the rice-cake to a dog and remained without food.
<p/>'' Simple is the life which people lead in this world here,'' thought Siddhartha. '' It presents no difficulties. Everything was difficult, toilsome, and ultimately hopeless, when I was still a Samana.
<p/>Now, everything is easy, easy like that lessons in kissing, which Kamala is giving me. I need clothes and money, nothing else; this a small, near goals, they won't make a person lose any sleep.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had already discovered Kamala's house in the city long before, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) turned up the following day. '' Things are working out well,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) called out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>'' They are expecting you at Kamaswami's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is the richest merchant of the city. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)'ll like you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)'ll accept you into his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) service.
<p/>Be smart, brown Samana. I had others tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) about you. Be polite towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is very powerful. But don't be too modest!
<p/>I do not want you to become his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) servant, you shall become his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) equal, or else I won't be satisfied with you.
<p/>Siddhartha thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) and laughed, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) found out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had not eaten anything yesterday and today, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) sent for bread and fruits and treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to it.
<p/>Kamaswami is starting to get old and lazy. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)'ll like you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)'ll entrust you with a lot. '' '' You've been lucky,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) said when they parted, ``I'm opening one door after another for you.
<p/>Siddhartha said: <div class="bookquote">``Yesterday, I told you I knew how to think, to wait, and to fast, but you thought this was of no use.
<p/>You'll see that the stupid Samanas are learning and able to do many pretty things in the forest, which the likes of you aren't capable of.
<p/>The day before yesterday, I was still a shaggy beggar, as soon as yesterday I have kissed Kamala, and soon I'll be a merchant and have money and all those things you insist upon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div><p/>How come? Do you have a spell?'' But it is useful for many things, Kamala, you'll see. '' Well yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) admitted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Kamala,''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>said Siddhartha and straightened up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) full height, <div class="bookquote">``when I came to you into your grove, I did the first step.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>But where would you be without me? What would you be, if Kamala wasn't helping you?'' It was my resolution to learn love from this most beautiful woman.
<p/>I knew that you would help me, at your first glance at the entrance of the grove I already knew it.''
<p/>From that moment on when I had made this resolution, I also knew that I would carry it out. '' But what if I hadn't been willing?''
<p/>Look, Kamala: When you throw a rock into the water, it will speed on the fastest course to the bottom of the water.
<p/>Siddhartha does nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) waits, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thinks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) fasts, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is drawn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) lets himself fall.
<p/>'' You were willing. This is how it is when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolution. His (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) goal attracts him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) doesn't let anything enter his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) soul which might oppose the goal.
<p/>This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas. This is what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by means of the daemons.
<p/>Everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) goals, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is able to think, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is able to wait, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is able to fast.
<p/>Nothing is effected by daemons, there are no daemons. '' Kamala listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) loved the look from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>But perhaps it is also like this: that Siddhartha is a handsome man, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) glance pleases the women, that therefore good fortune is coming towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>'' Perhaps it is so,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``as you say, friend. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>With one kiss, Siddhartha bid his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) farewell. ''
<p/>I wish that it should be this way, my teacher; that my glance shall please you, that always good fortune shall come to me out of your direction!''
<p/>WITH THE CHILDLIKE PEOPLE Siddhartha went to Kamaswami the merchant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was directed into a rich house, servants led him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) between precious carpets into a chamber, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) awaited the master of the house.
<p/>Kamaswami entered, a swiftly, smoothly moving man with very gray hair, with very intelligent, cautious eyes, with a greedy mouth. Politely, the host and the guest greeted one another.
<p/>I have been told,'' the merchant began, <div class="bookquote">``that you were a Brahman, a learned man, but that you seek to be in the service of a merchant.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the merchant</b></font>)</div>Might you have become destitute, Brahman, so that you seek to serve?'' '' No,'' said Siddhartha, <div class="bookquote">``I have not become destitute and have never been destitute.
<p/>You should know that I'm coming from the Samanas, with whom I have lived for a long time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>'' If you're coming from the Samanas, how could you be anything but destitute?
<p/>Aren't the Samanas entirely without possessions?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am without possessions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>said Siddhartha, <div class="bookquote">``if this is what you mean. Surely, I am without possessions.
<p/>But I am so voluntarily, and therefore I am not destitute. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>'' But what are you planning to live of, being without possessions?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't thought of this yet, sir. For more than three years, I have been without possessions, and have never thought about of what I should live.''
 (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div><p/>'' So you've lived of the possessions of others. '' <div class="bookquote">``Presumable this is how it is. After all, a merchant also lives of what other people own.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well said. But he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) wouldn't take anything from another person for nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) would give his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) merchandise in return.''
<p/>'' So it seems to be indeed. Everyone takes, everyone gives, such is life.'' '' But if you don't mind me asking: being without possessions, what would you like to give?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everyone gives what he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) has. The warrior gives strength, the merchant gives merchandise, the teacher teachings, the farmer rice, the fisher fish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes indeed. And what is it now what you've got to give? What is it that you've learned, what you're able to do?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can think. I can wait. I can fast.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That's everything?'' <div class="bookquote">``I believe, that's everything!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And what's the use of that?
<p/>For example, the fasting--what is it good for?'' ``It is very good, sir. When a person has nothing to eat, fasting is the smartest thing he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could do.
<p/>When, for example, Siddhartha hadn't learned to fast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) would have to accept any kind of service before this day is up, whether it may be with you or wherever, because hunger would force him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to do so.
<p/>But like this, Siddhartha can wait calmly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) knows no impatience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) knows no emergency, for a long time he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) can allow hunger to besiege him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) and can laugh about it.
<p/>Kamaswami left the room and returned with a scroll, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) handed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) guest while asking: <div class="bookquote">``Can you read this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>guest</b></font>)</div><p/>This, sir, is what fasting is good for.'' '' You're right, Samana. Wait for a moment. '' Siddhartha looked at the scroll, on which a sales-contract had been written down, and began to read out its contents.
<p/>'' Excellent,'' said Kamaswami. '' And would you write something for me on this piece of paper? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) a piece of paper and a pen, and Siddhartha wrote and returned the paper.
<p/>Kamaswami read: <div class="bookquote">``Writing is good, thinking is better. Being smart is good, being patient is better.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kamaswami</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is excellent how you're able to write,''  (<font color='red'><b>the merchant</b></font>)</div>the merchant praised him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>).
<p/>'' Many a thing we will still have to discuss with one another. For today, I'm asking you to be my guest and to live in this house.
<p/>'' Siddhartha thanked and accepted, and lived in the dealers house from now on. Clothes were brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and shoes, and every day, a servant prepared a bath for him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).
<p/>Twice a day, a plentiful meal was served, but Siddhartha only ate once a day, and ate neither meat nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) drink wine.
<p/>Kamaswami told him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) trade, showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) the merchandise and storage-rooms, showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) calculations. Siddhartha got to know many new things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heard a lot and spoke little.
<p/>And thinking of Kamala's words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was never subservient to the merchant, forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) as an equal, yes even more than an equal.
<p/>Kamaswami conducted his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) business with care and often with passion, but Siddhartha looked upon all of this as if it was a game, the rules of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) tried hard to learn precisely, but the contents of which did not touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart.
<p/>But daily, at the hour appointed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) visited beautiful Kamala, wearing pretty clothes, fine shoes, and soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) gifts as well.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was not in Kamaswami's house for long, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) already took part in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) landlords business. Much he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) learned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) red, smart mouth.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), who was, regarding love, still a boy and had a tendency to plunge blindly and insatiably into lust like into a bottomless pit, him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) taught, thoroughly starting with the basics, about that school of thought which teaches that pleasure cannot be taken without giving pleasure, and that every gesture, every caress, every touch, every look, every spot of the body, however small it was, had its secret, which would bring happiness to those who know about it and unleash it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) taught him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), that lovers must not part from one another after celebrating love, without one admiring the other, without being just as defeated as they have been victorious, so that with none of them should start feeling fed up or bored and get that evil feeling of having abused or having been abused.
<p/>Much he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) learned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) tender, supple hand. Wonderful hours he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spent with the beautiful and smart artist, became her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) student, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) lover, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) friend.
<p/>The merchant passed to duties of writing important letters and contracts on to him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) and got into the habit of discussing all important affairs with him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) soon saw that Siddhartha knew little about rice and wool, shipping and trade, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) acted in a fortunate manner, and that Siddhartha surpassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), the merchant, in calmness and equanimity, and in the art of listening and deeply understanding previously unknown people.
<p/>This Brahman,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) said to a friend, ``is no proper merchant and will never be one, there is never any passion in his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) soul when he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) conducts our business.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) has that mysterious quality of those people to whom success comes all by itself, whether this may be a good star of his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) birth, magic, or something he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) has learned among Samanas.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) always seems to be merely playing with out business-affairs, they never fully become a part of him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>), they never rule over him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) is never afraid of failure, he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) is never upset by a loss.
<p/>The friend advised the merchant: <div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) from the business he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) conducts for you a third of the profits, but let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) also be liable for the same amount of the losses, when there is a loss.
<p/>Here with Kamala was the worth and purpose of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) present life, nt with the business of Kamaswami. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the merchant</b></font>)</div>'' Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'ll become more zealous.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) made a profit, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) accepted it with equanimity; when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) made losses, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) laughed and said: <div class="bookquote">``Well, look at this, so this one turned out badly!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Kamaswami followed the advice. But Siddhartha cared little about this. '' It seemed indeed, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) did not care about the business.
<p/>At one time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) travelled to a village to buy a large harvest of rice there. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) got there, the rice had already been sold to another merchant.
<p/>Nevertheless, Siddhartha stayed for several days in that village, treated the farmers for a drink, gave copper-coins to their children, joined in the celebration of a wedding, and returned extremely satisfied from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) trip.
<p/>Kamaswami held against him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had not turned back right away, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had wasted time and money. Siddhartha answered: <div class="bookquote">``Stop scolding, dear friend!
<p/>Nothing was ever achieved by scolding. If a loss has occurred, let me bear that loss. I am very satisfied with this trip.
<p/>I have gotten to know many kinds of people, a Brahman has become my friend, children have sat on my knees, farmers have shown me their fields, nobody knew that I was a merchant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That's all very nice,'' exclaimed Kamaswami indignantly, <div class="bookquote">``but in fact, you are a merchant after all, one ought to think!
<p/>Or might you have only travelled for your amusement?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kamaswami</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha laughed, <div class="bookquote">``surely I have travelled for my amusement. For what else?
<p/>Look, my dear, if I had been Kamaswami, I would have travelled back, being annoyed and in a hurry, as soon as I had seen that my purchase had been rendered impossible, and time and money would indeed have been lost.
<p/>I have gotten to know people and places, I have received kindness and trust, I have found friendship. But like this, I've had a few good days, I've learned, had joy
<p/>And if I'll ever return there again, perhaps to buy an upcoming harvest, or for whatever purpose it might be, friendly people will receive me in a friendly and happy manner, and I will praise myself for not showing any hurry and displeasure at that time.
<p/>, I've neither harmed myself nor others by annoyance and hastiness. So, leave it as it is, my friend, and don't harm yourself by scolding!
<p/>If the day will come, when you will see: this Siddhartha is harming me, then speak a word and Siddhartha will go on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) own path.
<p/>But until then, let's be satisfied with one another. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Futile were also the merchant's attempts, to convince Siddhartha that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) should eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) bread.
<p/>Siddhartha ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) own bread, or rather they both ate other people's bread, all people's bread. Siddhartha never listened to Kamaswami's worries and Kamaswami had many worries.
<p/>Whether there was a business-deal going on which was in danger of failing, or whether a shipment of merchandise seemed to have been lost, or a debtor seemed to be unable to pay, Kamaswami could never convince his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) partner that it would be useful to utter a few words of worry or anger, to have wrinkles on the forehead, to sleep badly.
<p/>When, one day, Kamaswami held against him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had learned everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) knew from him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) replied: <div class="bookquote">``Would you please not kid me with such jokes!
<p/>What I've learned from you is how much a basket of fish costs and how much interests may be charged on loaned money.
<p/>I haven't learned to think from you, my dear Kamaswami, you ought to be the one seeking to learn from me.
<p/>The business was good enough to provide him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) with the money for Kamala, and it earned him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) needed.
<p/>Besides from this, Siddhartha's interest and curiosity was only concerned with the people, whose businesses, crafts, worries, pleasures, and acts of foolishness used to be as alien and distant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) as the moon.
<p/>However easily he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) succeeded in talking to all of them, in living with all of them, in learning from all of them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was still aware that there was something which separated him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) from them and
<p/>These are your areas of expertise. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Indeed his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) soul was not with the trade. this separating factor was him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) being a Samana.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw mankind going through life in a childlike or animallike manner, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) loved and also despised at the same time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw them toiling, saw them suffering, and becoming gray for the sake of things which seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to entirely unworthy of this price, for money, for little pleasures, for being slightly honoured, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw them scolding and insulting each other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw them complaining about pain at which a Samana would only smile, and suffering because of deprivations which a Samana would not feel.
<p/>Welcome was the merchant who offered him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) linen for sale, welcome was the debtor who sought another loan, welcome was the beggar who told him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) for one hour the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) poverty and who was not half as poor as any given Samana.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) did not treat the rich foreign merchant any different than the servant who shaved him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) and the street-vendor whom he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) let cheat him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) out of some small change when buying bananas.
<p/>When Kamaswami came to him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), to complain about his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) worries or to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) concerning his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) business, he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) listened curiously and happily, was puzzled by him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), tried to understand him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), consented that he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was a little bit right, only as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) considered indispensable, and turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), towards the next person who would ask for him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>).
<p/>And there were many who came to him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), many to do business with him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), many to cheat him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), many to draw some secret out of him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), many to appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) sympathy, many to get his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) advice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) gave advice, he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) pitied, he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) made gifts, he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) let them cheat him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) a bit, and this entire game and the passion with which all people played this game occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) thoughts just as much as the gods and Brahmans used to occupy them.
<p/>At times he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) felt, deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) chest, a dying, quiet voice, which admonished him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) quietly, lamented quietly; he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) hardly perceived it.
<p/>And then, for an hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) became aware of the strange life he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was leading, of him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) doing lots of things which were only a game, of, though being happy and feeling joy at times, real life still passing him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) by and not touching him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>).
<p/>As a ball-player plays with his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) balls, he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) played with his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) business-deals, with the people around him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), watched them, found amusement in them; with his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) heart, with the source of his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) being, he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was not with them.
<p/>The source ran somewhere, far away from him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), ran and ran invisibly, had nothing to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) life any more.
<p/>And at several times he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) suddenly became scared on account of such thoughts and wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) would also be gifted with the ability to participate in all of this childlike-naive occupations of the daytime with passion and with his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) heart, really to live, really to act, really to enjoy and to live instead of just standing by as a spectator.
<p/>But again and again, he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) came back to beautiful Kamala, learned the art of love, practised the cult of lust, in which more than in anything else giving and taking becomes one, chatted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>), learned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>), gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) advice, received advice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) was open to everything, these people brought his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) understood him (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) better than Govinda used to understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) was more similar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>).
<p/>You are Kamala, nothing else, and inside of you, there is a peace and refuge, to which you can go at every hour of the day and be at home at yourself, as I can also do.
<p/>Once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``You are like me, you are different from most people. Few people have this, and yet all could have it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not all people are smart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kamala</b></font>)</div>said Kamala. '' No,'' said Siddhartha, <div class="bookquote">``that's not the reason why. Kamaswami is just as smart as I, and still has no refuge in himself.
<p/>Most people, Kamala, are like a falling leaf, which is blown and is turning around through the air, and wavers, and tumbles to the ground.
<p/>But others, a few, are like stars, they go on a fixed course, no wind reaches them, in themselves they have their law and their course.
<p/>Among all the learned men and Samanas, of which I knew many, there was one of this kind, a perfected one, I'll never be able to forget him (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>).
<p/>Others have it, who are small children with respect to their mind. It is that Gotama, the exalted one, who is spreading that teachings.
<p/>Thousands of followers are listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) teachings every day, follow his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) instructions every hour, but they are all falling leaves, not in themselves they have teachings and a law.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Kamala looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) with a smile. '' Again, you're talking about him (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``again, you're having a Samana's thoughts.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha said nothing, and they played the game of love, one of the thirty or forty different games Kamala knew.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) body was flexible like that of a jaguar and like the bow of a hunter; he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) who had learned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) how to make love, was knowledgeable of many forms of lust, many secrets.
<p/>For a long time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) played with Siddhartha, enticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), rejected him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>): enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) masterful skills, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was defeated and rested exhausted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) side.
<p/>The courtesan bent over him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), took a long look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) face, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes, which had grown tired. '' You are the best lover,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) said thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``I ever saw.
<p/>You're stronger than others, more supple, more willing. You've learned my art well, Siddhartha. At some time, when I'll be older, I'd want to bear your child.
<p/>And yet, my dear, you've remained a Samana, and yet you do not love me, you love nobody. Isn't it so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It might very well be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha said tiredly. '' I am like you. You also do not love--how else could you practise love as a craft?
<p/>SANSARA For a long time, Siddhartha had lived the life of the world and of lust, though without being a part of it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) senses, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had killed off in hot years as a Samana, had awoken again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had tasted riches, had tasted lust, had tasted power; nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had still remained in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart for a long time a Samana; Kamala, being smart, had realized this quite right.
<p/>It was still the art of thinking, of waiting, of fasting, which guided his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life; still the people of the world, the childlike people, had remained alien to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was alien to them.
<p/>Perhaps, people of our kind can't love. The childlike people can; that's their secret. '' Years passed by; surrounded by the good life, Siddhartha hardly felt them fading away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had become rich, for quite a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) possessed a house of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) own and his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) own servants, and a garden before the city by the river.
<p/>The people liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), they came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), whenever they needed money or advice, but there was nobody close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), except Kamala.
<p/>That high, bright state of being awake, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had experienced that one time at the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) youth, in those days after Gotama's sermon, after the separation from Govinda, that tense expectation, that proud state of standing alone without teachings and without teachers, that supple willingness to listen to the divine voice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) own heart, had slowly become a memory, had been fleeting; distant and quiet, the holy source murmured, which used to be near, which used to murmur within himself.
<p/>Nevertheless, many things he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had learned from the Samanas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had learned from Gotama, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had learned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) father the Brahman, had remained within him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) for a long time afterwards: moderate living, joy of thinking, hours of meditation, secret knowledge of the self, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) eternal entity, which is neither body nor consciousness.
<p/>Just as a potter's wheel, once it has been set in motion, will keep on turning for a long time and only slowly lose its vigour and come to a stop, thus Siddhartha's soul had kept on turning the wheel of asceticism, the wheel of thinking, the wheel of differentiation for a long time, still turning, but it turned slowly and hesitantly and was close to coming to a standstill.
<p/>Slowly, like humidity entering the dying stem of a tree, filling it slowly and making it rot, the world and sloth had entered Siddhartha's soul, slowly it filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) soul, made it heavy, made it tired, put it to sleep.
<p/>Many a part of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) still had, but one part after another had been submerged and had gathered dust. On the other hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) senses had become alive, there was much they had learned, much they had experienced.
<p/>Siddhartha had learned to trade, to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) power over people, to enjoy himself with a woman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had learned to wear beautiful clothes, to give orders to servants, to bathe in perfumed waters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had learned to eat tenderly and carefully prepared food, even fish, even meat and poultry, spices and sweets, and to drink wine, which causes sloth and forgetfulness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had learned to play with dice and on a chess-board, to watch dancing girls, to have himself carried about in a sedan-chair, to sleep on a soft bed.
<p/>But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had felt different from and superior to the others; always he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had watched them with some mockery, some mocking disdain, with the same disdain which a Samana constantly feels for the people of the world.
<p/>When Kamaswami was ailing, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was annoyed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt insulted, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was vexed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) worries as a merchant, Siddhartha had always watched it with mockery.
<p/>Just slowly and imperceptibly, as the harvest seasons and rainy seasons passed by, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mockery had become more tired, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) superiority had become more quiet.
<p/>Just slowly, among his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) growing riches, Siddhartha had assumed something of the childlike people's ways for himself, something of their childlikeness and of their fearfulness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) envied them for the one thing that was missing from him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) and that they had, the importance they were able to attach to their lives, the amount of passion in their joys and fears, the fearful but sweet happiness of being constantly in love.
<p/>These people were all of the time in love with themselves, with women, with their children, with honours or money, with plans or hopes.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) did not learn this from them, this out of all things, this joy of a child and this foolishness of a child; he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) learned from them out of all things the unpleasant ones, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) himself despised.
<p/>It happened more and more often that, in the morning after having had company the night before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) stayed in bed for a long time, felt unable to think and tired.
<p/>And yet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) envied them, envied them just the more, the more similar he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) became to them. It happened that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) became angry and impatient, when Kamaswami bored him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) worries.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) face was still smarter and more spiritual than others, but it rarely laughed, and assumed, one after another, those features which are so often found in the faces of rich people, those features of discontent, of sickliness, of ill-humour, of sloth, of a lack of love.
<p/>It happened that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) laughed just too loud, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) lost a game of dice. Slowly the disease of the soul, which rich people have, grabbed hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>Like a veil, like a thin mist, tiredness came over Siddhartha, slowly, getting a bit denser every day, a bit murkier every month, a bit heavier every year.
<p/>As a new dress becomes old in time, loses its beautiful colour in time, gets stains, gets wrinkles, gets worn off at the seams, and starts to show threadbare spots here and there, thus Siddhartha's new life, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had started after his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) separation from Govinda, had grown old, lost colour and splendour as the years passed by, was gathering wrinkles and stains, and hidden at bottom, already showing its ugliness here and there, disappointment and disgust were waiting.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) only noticed that this bright and reliable voice inside of him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), which had awoken in him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) at that time and had ever guided him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) best times, had become silent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had been captured by the world, by lust, covetousness, sloth, and finally also by that vice which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had used to despise and mock the most as the most foolish one of all vices: greed.
<p/>Property, possessions, and riches also had finally captured him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>); they were no longer a game and trifles to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), had become a shackle and a burden.
<p/>In a strange and devious way, Siddhartha had gotten into this final and most base of all dependencies, by means of the game of dice.
<p/>It was since that time, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had stopped being a Samana in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart, that Siddhartha began to play the game for money and precious things, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) at other times only joined with a smile and casually as a custom of the childlike people, with an increasing rage and passion.
<p/>Siddhartha did not notice it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was a feared gambler, few dared to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) on, so high and audacious were his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) stakes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) played the game due to a pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart, losing and wasting his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wretched money in the game brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) an angry joy, in no other way he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could demonstrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) disdain for wealth, the merchants' false god, more clearly and more mockingly.
<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) gambled with high stakes and mercilessly, hating himself, mocking himself, won thousands, threw away thousands, lost money, lost jewelry, lost a house in the country, won again, lost again.
<p/>That fear, that terrible and petrifying fear, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt while he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was rolling the dice, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was worried about losing high stakes, that fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) loved and sought to always renew it, always increase it, always get it to a slightly higher level, for in this feeling alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) still felt something like happiness, something like an intoxication, something like an elevated form of life in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saturated, lukewarm, dull life.
<p/>And after each big loss, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mind was set on new riches, pursued the trade more zealously, forced his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) debtors more strictly to pay, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wanted to continue gambling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wanted to continue squandering, continue demonstrating his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) disdain of wealth.
<p/>Siddhartha lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) calmness when losses occurred, lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) patience when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was not payed on time, lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) kindness towards beggars, lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) disposition for giving away and loaning money to those who petitioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), who gambled away tens of thousands at one roll of the dice and laughed at it, became more strict and more petty in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) business, occasionally dreaming at night about money!
<p/>And whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) woke up from this ugly spell, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) face in the mirror at the bedroom's wall to have aged and become more ugly, whenever embarrassment and disgust came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) continued fleeing, fleeing into a new game, fleeing into a numbing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mind brought on by sex, by wine, and from there he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) fled back into the urge to pile up and obtain possessions.
<p/>In this pointless cycle he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) ran, growing tired, growing old, growing ill. Then the time came when a dream warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>They had been sitting under the trees, talking, and Kamala had said thoughtful words, words behind which a sadness and tiredness lay hidden.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) about Gotama, and could not hear enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), how clear his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes, how still and beautiful
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had spent the hours of the evening with Kamala, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) beautiful pleasure-garden. his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mouth, how kind his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) smile, how peaceful his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) walk had been.
<p/>For a long time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) about the exalted Buddha, and Kamala had sighed and had said: <div class="bookquote">``One day, perhaps soon, I'll also follow that Buddha.
<p/>But after this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) had aroused him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>), and had tied him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) in the act of making love with painful fervour, biting and in tears, as if, once more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) wanted to squeeze the last sweet drop out of this vain, fleeting pleasure.
<p/>I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) my pleasure-garden for a gift and take my refuge in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) teachings. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Kamala</b></font>)</div>Never before, it had become so strangely clear to Siddhartha,
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had lain by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) side, and Kamala's face had been close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and under her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) eyes and next to the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) mouth he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had, as clearly as never before, read a fearful inscription, an inscription of small lines, of slight grooves, an inscription reminiscent of autumn and old age, just as Siddhartha himself, who was only in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) forties, had already noticed, here and there, gray hairs among his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) black ones.
<p/>Tiredness was written on Kamala's beautiful face, tiredness from walking a long path, which has no happy destination, tiredness and the beginning of withering, and concealed, still unsaid, perhaps not even conscious anxiety: fear of old age, fear of the autumn, fear of having to die.
<p/>how closely lust was akin to death. With a sigh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had bid his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) farewell to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>), the soul full of reluctance, and full of concealed anxiety.
<p/>Then, Siddhartha had spent the night in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) house with dancing girls and wine, had acted as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was superior to them towards the fellow-members of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) caste, though this was no longer true, had drunk much wine and gone to bed a long time after midnight, being tired and yet excited, close to weeping and despair, and had for a long time sought to sleep in vain, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart full of misery which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could not bear any longer, full of a disgust which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt penetrating his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) entire body like the lukewarm, repulsive taste of the wine, the just too sweet, dull music, the just too soft smile of the dancing girls, the just too sweet scent of their hair and breasts.
<p/>But more than by anything else, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was disgusted by himself, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) perfumed hair, by the smell of wine from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mouth, by the flabby tiredness and listlessness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) skin.
<p/>Like when someone, who has eaten and drunk far too much, vomits it back up again with agonising pain and is nevertheless glad about the relief, thus this sleepless man wished to free himself of these pleasures, these habits and all of this pointless life and himself, in an immense burst of disgust.
<p/>Not until the light of the morning and the beginning of the first activities in the street before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) city-house, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had slightly fallen asleep, had found for a few moments a half unconsciousness, a hint of sleep.
<p/>In those moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a dream: Kamala owned a small, rare singing bird in a golden cage. Of this bird, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dreamt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dreamt: this bird had become mute, who at other times always used to sing in the morning, and since this arose his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attention, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stepped in front of the cage and looked inside; there the small bird was dead and lay stiff on the ground.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took it out, weighed it for a moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and then threw it away, out in the street, and in the same moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt terribly shocked, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart hurt, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had thrown away from himself all value and everything good by throwing out this dead bird.
<p/>Worthless, so it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), worthless and pointless was the way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been going through life; nothing which was alive, nothing which was in some way delicious or worth keeping he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Starting up from this dream, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt encompassed by a deep sadness. Alone he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood there and empty like a castaway on the shore.
<p/>With a gloomy mind, Siddhartha went to the pleasure-garden he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) owned, locked the gate, sat down under a mango-tree, felt death in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart and horror in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) chest, sat and sensed how everything died in him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), withered in him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), came to an end in him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>By and by, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) gathered his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thoughts, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) once again went the entire path of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life, starting with the first days he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could remember.
<p/>When was there ever a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had experienced happiness, felt a true bliss? Oh yes, several times he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had experienced such a thing.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) years as a boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has had a taste of it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had obtained praise from the Brahmans, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had felt it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart:
<p/>``There is a path in front of the one who has distinguished himself in the recitation of the holy verses, in the dispute with the learned ones, as an assistant in the offerings.
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) had felt it in his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) heart: ``There is a path in front of you, you are destined for, the gods are awaiting you.
<p/>And again, as a young man, when the ever rising, upward fleeing, goal of all thinking had ripped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of and up from the multitude of those seeking the same goal, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrestled in pain for the purpose of Brahman, when every obtained knowledge only kindled new thirst in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), then again he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, in the midst of the thirst, in the midst of the pain felt this very same thing: <div class="bookquote">``Go on!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard this voice when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home and had chosen the life of a Samana, and again when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone away from the Samanas to that perfected one, and also when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the uncertain.
<p/>For how long had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not heard this voice any more, for how long had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached no height any more, how even and dull was the manner in which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) path had passed through life, for many long years, without a high goal, without thirst, without elevation, content with small lustful pleasures and yet never satisfied!
<p/>For all of these many years, without knowing it himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had tried hard and longed to become a man like those many, like those children, and in all this, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life had been much more miserable and poorer than theirs, and their goals were not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), nor their worries; after all, that entire world of the Kamaswami-people had only been a game to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), a dance he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would watch, a comedy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>'' Go on! You are called upon! '' Only Kamala had been dear, had been valuable to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--but was she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) still thus?
<p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still need her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>), or she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Did they not play a game without an ending? Was it necessary to live for this?
<p/>The name of this game was Sansara, a game for children, a game which was perhaps enjoyable to play once, twice, ten times--but for ever and ever over again?
<p/>No, it was not necessary! Then, Siddhartha knew that the game was over, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could not play it any more.
<p/>Shivers ran over his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) body, inside of him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), so he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt, something had died. That entire day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) sat under the mango-tree, thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father, thinking of Govinda, thinking of Gotama.
<p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) have to leave them to become a Kamaswami? He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) still sat there, when the night had fallen. When, looking up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) caught sight of the stars, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought: <div class="bookquote">``Here I'm sitting under my mango-tree, in my pleasure-garden.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) smiled a little --was it really necessary, was it right, was it not as foolish game, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) owned a mango-tree, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) owned a garden?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) also put an end to this, this also died in him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) rose, bid his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) farewell to the mango-tree, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) farewell to the pleasure-garden.
<p/>Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had been without food this day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt strong hunger, and thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) house in the city, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) chamber and bed, of the table with the meals on it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) smiled tiredly, shook himself, and bid his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) farewell to these things. In the same hour of the night, Siddhartha left his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) garden, left the city, and never came back.
<p/>For a long time, Kamaswami had people look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had fallen into the hands of robbers. Kamala had no one look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) was told that Siddhartha had disappeared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) was not astonished. Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) not always expect it? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) not a Samana, a man who was at home nowhere, a pilgrim?
<p/>And most of all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) had felt this the last time they had been together, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) was happy, in spite of all the pain of the loss, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) had pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) so affectionately to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) heart for this last time, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) had felt one more time to be so completely possessed and penetrated by him (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>).
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) received the first news of Siddhartha's disappearance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) went to the window, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) held a rare singing bird captive in a golden cage.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) opened the door of the cage, took the bird out and let it fly. For a long time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) gazed after it, the flying bird.
<p/>From this day on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) received no more visitors and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) house locked. But after some time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) became aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) was pregnant from the last time she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) was together with Siddhartha.
<p/>BY THE RIVER Siddhartha walked through the forest, was already far from the city, and knew nothing but that one thing, that there was no going back for him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), that this life, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had lived it for many years until now, was over and done away with, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had tasted all of it, sucked everything out of it until he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was disgusted with it.
<p/>Deeply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had been entangled in Sansara, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had sucked up disgust and death from all sides into his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) body, like a sponge sucks up water until it is full.
<p/>And full he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was, full of the feeling of been sick of it, full of misery, full of death, there was nothing left in this world which could have attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), given him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) joy, given him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) comfort.
<p/>Dead was the singing bird, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had dreamt of. Dead was the bird in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart. Passionately he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wished to know nothing about himself anymore, to have rest, to be dead.
<p/>If there only was a wine, a poison which would numb his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) senses, bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) forgetfulness and sleep, and no awakening from that!
<p/>Was there still any kind of filth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had not soiled himself with, a sin or foolish act he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had not committed, a dreariness of the soul he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had not brought upon himself?
<p/>If there only was a lightning-bolt to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) dead! If there only was a tiger to devour him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)! Was it still at all possible to be alive?
<p/>Was it possible, to breathe in again and again, to breathe out, to feel hunger, to eat again, to sleep again, to sleep with a woman again?
<p/>Siddhartha reached the large river in the forest, the same river over which a long time ago, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had still been a young man and came from the town of Gotama, a ferryman had conducted him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>Was this cycle not exhausted and brought to a conclusion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)? By this river he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) stopped, hesitantly he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) stood at the bank.
<p/>No, there were no more goals, there was nothing left but the deep, painful yearning to shake off this whole desolate dream, to spit out this stale wine, to put an end to this miserable and shameful life.
<p/>A hang bent over the bank of the river, a coconut-tree; Siddhartha leaned against its trunk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) shoulder, embraced the trunk with one arm, and looked down into the green water, which ran and ran under him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), looked down and found himself to be entirely filled with the wish to let go and to drown in these waters.
<p/>Tiredness and hunger had weakened him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and whatever for should he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) walk on, wherever to, to which goal? A frightening emptiness was reflected back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) by the water, answering to the terrible emptiness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) soul.
<p/>There was nothing left for him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), except to annihilate himself, except to smash the failure into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had shaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life, to throw it away, before the feet of mockingly laughing gods.
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had reached the end. This was the great vomiting he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had longed for: death, the smashing to bits of the form he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hated!
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) be food for fishes, this dog Siddhartha, this lunatic, this depraved and rotten body, this weakened and abused soul!
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) be food for fishes and crocodiles, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) be chopped to bits by the daemons! With a distorted face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) stared into the water, saw the reflection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) face and spit at it.
<p/>In deep tiredness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) arm away from the trunk of the tree and turned a bit, in order to let himself fall straight down, in order to finally drown.
<p/>Then, out of remote areas of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) soul, out of past times of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) now weary life, a sound stirred up.
<p/>It was a word, a syllable, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), without thinking, with a slurred voice, spoke to himself, the old word which is the beginning and the end of all prayers of the Brahmans, the holy <div class="bookquote">``Om'' (<font color='red'><b>the Brahmans Om</b></font>)</div>, which roughly means <div class="bookquote">``that what is perfect''  (<font color='red'><b>the Brahmans Om</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``the completion'' (<font color='red'><b>the Brahmans Om</b></font>)</div>.
<p/>And in the moment when the sound of <div class="bookquote">``Om''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>touched Siddhartha's ear, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) dormant spirit suddenly woke up and realized the foolishness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) actions.
<p/>So this was how things were with him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), so doomed was he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), so much he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) way and was forsaken by all knowledge, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had been able to seek death, that this wish, this wish of a child, had been able to grow in him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>): to find rest by annihilating his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) body!
<p/>What all agony of these recent times, all sobering realizations, all desperation had not brought about, this was brought on by this moment, when the Om entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) consciousness: he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) became aware of himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) misery and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) error.
<p/>and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) knew about Brahman, knew about the indestructibility of life, knew about all that is divine, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had forgotten.
<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes closed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) slipped towards death. Siddhartha was deeply shocked. Om! he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) spoke to himself: Om! But this was only a moment, flash.
<p/>By the foot of the coconut-tree, Siddhartha collapsed, struck down by tiredness, mumbling Om, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) head on the root of the tree and fell into a deep sleep.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) woke up after many hours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt as if ten years had passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heard the water quietly flowing, did not know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was and who had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) here, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes, saw with astonishment that there were trees and the sky above him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) remembered where he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) got here.
<p/>But it took him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) a long while for this, and the past seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) as if it had been covered by a veil, infinitely distant, infinitely far away, infinitely meaningless.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) only knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) previous life -LRB-in the first moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought about it, this past life seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) like a very old, previous incarnation, like an early pre-birth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) present self-RRB---that his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) previous life had been abandoned by him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), that, full of disgust and wretchedness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had even intended to throw his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life away, but that by a river, under a coconut-tree, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) senses, the holy word Om on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) lips, that then he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had fallen asleep and had now woken up and was looking at the world as a new man.
<p/>Quietly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke the word Om to himself, speaking which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had fallen asleep, and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as if his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entire long sleep had been nothing but a long meditative recitation of Om, a thinking of Om, a submergence and complete entering into Om, into the nameless, the perfected.
<p/>Deep was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleep and without dreams, for a long time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not known such a sleep any more. What a wonderful sleep had this been!
<p/>Never before by sleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been thus refreshed, thus renewed, thus rejuvenated! Perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had really died, had drowned and was reborn in a new body?
<p/>But no, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, knew the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay, knew this self in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chest, this Siddhartha, the eccentric, the weird one, but this Siddhartha was nevertheless transformed, was renewed, was strangely well rested, strangely awake, joyful and curious.
<p/>Siddhartha straightened up, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw a person sitting opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), an unknown man, a monk in a yellow robe with a shaven head, sitting in the position of pondering.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) observed the man, who had neither hair on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) head nor a beard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had not observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) for long when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) recognised this monk as Govinda, the friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) youth, Govinda who had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) refuge with the exalted Buddha.
<p/>But when Govinda now, sensing his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) gaze, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) eyes and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), Siddhartha saw that Govinda did not recognise him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>).
<p/>Govinda was happy to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) awake; apparently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had been sitting here for a long time and been waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) to wake up, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>).
<p/>Govinda had aged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) too, but still his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) face bore the same features, expressed zeal, faithfulness, searching, timidness. '' I have been sleeping,'' said Siddhartha.
<p/>It is not good to be sleeping in such places, where snakes often are and the animals of the forest have their paths.
<p/>I, oh sir, am a follower of the exalted Gotama, the Buddha, the Sakyamuni, and have been on a pilgrimage together with several of us on this path, when I saw you lying and sleeping in a place where it is dangerous to sleep.
<p/>Therefore, I sought to wake you up, oh sir, and since I saw that your sleep was very deep, I stayed behind from my group and sat with you.
<p/>'' However did you get here?'' '' You have been sleeping,'' answered Govinda. '' And then, so it seems, I have fallen asleep myself,
<p/>I who wanted to guard your sleep. Badly, I have served you, tiredness has overwhelmed me. But now that you're awake, let me go to catch up with my brothers.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I thank you, Samana, for watching out over my sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>spoke Siddhartha. '' You're friendly, you followers of the exalted one.
<p/>Now you may go then.'' <div class="bookquote">``I'm going, sir. May you, sir, always be in good health. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I thank you, Samana.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div><p/>Govinda made the gesture of a salutation and said: <div class="bookquote">``Farewell.''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Farewell, Govinda,''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>said Siddhartha. The monk stopped. <div class="bookquote">``Permit me to ask, sir, from where do you know my name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div><p/>oh Govinda, from your father's hut, and from the school of the Brahmans, and from the offerings, and from our walk to the Samanas, and from that hour when you took your refuge with the exalted one in the grove Jetavana.
<p/>Now, Siddhartha smiled. '' I know you, '' <div class="bookquote">``You're Siddhartha,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Govinda exclaimed loudly. '' Now, I'm recognising you, and don't comprehend any more how I couldn't recognise you right away.
<p/>Be welcome, Siddhartha, my joy is great, to see you again. '' <div class="bookquote">``It also gives me joy, to see you again.
<p/>You've been the guard of my sleep, again I thank you for this, though I wouldn't have required any guard. Where are you going to, oh friend?''
 (<font color='red'><b>monks</b></font>)</div><p/>We monks are always travelling, whenever it is not the rainy season, we always move from one place to another, live according to the rules if the teachings passed on to us, accept alms, move on.
<p/>'' I'm going nowhere. It is always like this. But you, Siddhartha, where are you going to? '' Quoth Siddhartha: <div class="bookquote">``With me too, friend, it is as it is with you.
<p/>I'm going nowhere. I'm just travelling. I'm on a pilgrimage. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Quoth Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Govinda spoke: <div class="bookquote">``You're saying: you're on a pilgrimage, and I believe in you.
<p/>You're wearing a rich man's garments, you're wearing the shoes of a distinguished gentleman, and your hair, with the fragrance of perfume, is not a pilgrim's hair, not the hair of a Samana.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div><p/>But, forgive me, oh Siddhartha, you do not look like a pilgrim. '' Right so, my dear, you have observed well, your keen eyes see everything.
<p/>But I haven't said to you that I was a Samana. I said: I'm on a pilgrimage. And so it is: I'm on a pilgrimage.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're on a pilgrimage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>said Govinda. '' But few would go on a pilgrimage in such clothes, few in such shoes, few with such hair.
<p/>Never I have met such a pilgrim, being a pilgrim myself for many years. '' <div class="bookquote">``I believe you, my dear Govinda.
<p/>Remember, my dear: Not eternal is the world of appearances, not eternal, anything but eternal are our garments and the style of our hair, and our hair and bodies themselves.
<p/>But now, today, you've met a pilgrim just like this, wearing such shoes, such a garment. I'm wearing a rich man's clothes, you've seen this quite right.
<p/>I'm wearing them, because I have been a rich man, and I'm wearing my hair like the worldly and lustful people, for I have been one of them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>'' And now, Siddhartha, what are you now? '' '' I don't know it, I don't know it just like you.
<p/>I'm travelling. I was a rich man and am no rich man any more, and what I'll be tomorrow, I don't know.
<p/>'' '' You've lost your riches?'' <div class="bookquote">``I've lost them or they me. They somehow happened to slip away from me. The wheel of physical manifestations is turning quickly, Govinda.
<p/>Where is Siddhartha the Brahman? Where is Siddhartha the Samana? Where is Siddhartha the rich man? Non-eternal things change quickly, Govinda, you know it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>Govinda looked at the friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) youth for a long time, with doubt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) eyes. After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) the salutation which one would use on a gentleman and went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) way.
<p/>And how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) not have loved everybody and everything in this moment, in the glorious hour after his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) wonderful sleep, filled with Om!
<p/>The enchantment, which had happened inside of him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) sleep and by means of the Om, was this very thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) loved everything, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) was full of joyful love for everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) saw.
<p/>And it was this very thing, so it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) now, which had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) sickness before, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) was not able to love anybody or anything.
<p/>With a smiling face, Siddhartha watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) leave, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) still, this faithful man, this fearful man. With a smiling face, Siddhartha watched the leaving monk.
<p/>The sleep had strengthened him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) much, but hunger gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) much pain, for by now he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had not eaten for two days, and the times were long past when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had been tough against hunger.
<p/>In those days, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) remembered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had boasted of three things to Kamala, had been able to do three noble and undefeatable feats: fasting--waiting--thinking.
<p/>These had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) possession, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) power and strength, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) solid staff; in the busy, laborious years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) youth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had learned these three feats, nothing else.
<p/>With sadness, and yet also with a smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought of that time. And now, they had abandoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), none of them was his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) any more, neither fasting, nor waiting, nor thinking.
<p/>For the most wretched things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had given them up, for what fades most quickly, for sensual lust, for the good life, for riches!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life had indeed been strange. And now, so it seemed, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had really become a childlike person. Siddhartha thought about his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) situation.
<p/>Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought, since all these most easily perishing things have slipped from me again, now I'm standing here under the sun again just as I have been standing here a little child, nothing is mine,
<p/>Thinking was hard on him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) did not really feel like it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) forced himself. I have no abilities, there is nothing I could bring about, I have learned nothing.
<p/>Now, that I'm no longer young, that my hair is already half gray, that my strength is fading, now I'm starting again at the beginning and as a child!
<p/>How wondrous is this! Again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had to smile. Yes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) fate had been strange! Things were going downhill with him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was again facing the world void and naked and stupid.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could not feed sad about this, no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) even felt a great urge to laugh, to laugh about himself, to laugh about this strange, foolish world.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) said to himself, and laughed about it, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was saying it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) happened to glance at the river, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) also saw the river going downhill, always moving on downhill, and singing and being happy through it all.
<p/>Was this not the river in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had intended to drown himself, in past times, a hundred years ago, or had he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) dreamed this?
<p/>'' Things are going downhill with you!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) liked this well, kindly he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) smiled at the river. Wondrous indeed was my life, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought, wondrous detours it has taken.
<p/>As a youth, I had only to do with asceticism, with thinking and meditation, was searching for Brahman, worshipped the eternal in the Atman.
<p/>But as a young man, I followed the penitents, lived in the forest, suffered of heat and frost, learned to hunger, taught my body to become dead.
<p/>Wonderfully, soon afterwards, insight came towards me in the form of the great Buddha's teachings, I felt the knowledge of the oneness of the world circling in me like my own blood.
<p/>As a boy, I had only to do with gods and offerings. But I also had to leave Buddha and the great knowledge.
<p/>I went and learned the art of love with Kamala, learned trading with Kamaswami, piled up money, wasted money, learned to love my stomach, learned to please my senses.
<p/>Isn't it just as if I had turned slowly and on a long detour from a man into a child, from a thinker into a childlike person?
<p/>I had to spend many years losing my spirit, to unlearn thinking again, to forget the oneness. And yet, this path has been very good; and yet, the bird in my chest has not died.
<p/>I had to pass through so much stupidity, through so much vices, through so many errors, through so much disgust and disappointments and woe, just to become a child again and to be able to start over.
<p/>But what a path has this been! But it was right so, my heart says <div class="bookquote">``Yes''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>to it, my eyes smile to it.
<p/>I've had to experience despair, I've had to sink down to the most foolish one of all thoughts, to the thought of suicide, in order to be able to experience divine grace, to hear Om again, to be able to sleep properly and awake properly again.
<p/>I had to become a fool, to find Atman in me again. I had to sin, to be able to live again.
<p/>Where else might my path lead me to? It is foolish, this path, it moves in loops, perhaps it is going around in a circle.
<p/>Let it go as it likes, I want to take it. Wonderfully, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) felt joy rolling like waves in his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) chest.
<p/>Wherever from, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) heart, where from did you get this happiness? Might it come from that long, good sleep, which has done me so good?
<p/>Or from the fact that I have escaped, that I have completely fled, that I am finally free again and am standing like a child under the sky?
<p/>Or from the word Om, which I said? Oh how good is it to have fled, to have become free! How clean and beautiful is the air here, how good to breathe!
<p/>There, where I ran away from, there everything smelled of ointments, of spices, of wine, of excess, of sloth. How did I hate this world of the rich, of those who revel in fine food, of the gamblers!
<p/>How did I hate myself for staying in this terrible world for so long! How did I hate myself, have deprive, poisoned, tortured myself, have made myself old and evil!
<p/>No, never again I will, as I used to like doing so much, delude myself into thinking that Siddhartha was wise!
<p/>But this one thing I have done well, this I like, this I must praise, that there is now an end to that hatred against myself, to that foolish and dreary life!
<p/>I praise you, Siddhartha, after so many years of foolishness, you have once again had an idea, have done something, have heard the bird in your chest singing and have followed it!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had now, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt, in these recent times and days, completely tasted and spit out, devoured up to the point of desperation and death, a piece of suffering, a piece of misery.
<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) praised himself, found joy in himself, listened curiously to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) stomach, which was rumbling with hunger. Like this, it was good.
<p/>For much longer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could have stayed with Kamaswami, made money, wasted money, filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) stomach, and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) soul die of thirst; for much longer he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could have lived in this soft, well upholstered hell, if this had not happened: the moment of complete hopelessness and despair, that most extreme moment, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hung over the rushing waters and was ready to destroy himself.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had felt this despair, this deep disgust, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had not succumbed to it, that the bird, the joyful source and voice in him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was still alive after all, this was why he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt joy, this was why he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) laughed, this was why his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) face was smiling brightly under his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hair which had turned gray.
<p/>That lust for the world and riches do not belong to the good things, I have already learned as a child.
<p/>'' It is good,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``to get a taste of everything for oneself, which one needs to know. I have known it for a long time, but I have experienced only now.
<p/>And now I know it, don't just know it in my memory, but in my eyes, in my heart, in my stomach.
<p/>Good for me, to know this!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For a long time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) pondered his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) transformation, listened to the bird, as it sang for joy.
<p/>Had not this bird died in him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), had he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) not felt its death? No, something else from within him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had died, something which already for a long time had yearned to die.
<p/>Was this not his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) self, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) small, frightened, and proud self, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had wrestled with for so many years, which had defeated him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) again and again, which was back again after every killing, prohibited joy, felt fear?
<p/>Was it not this what he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) used to intend to kill in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) ardent years as a penitent? Was it not this, which today had finally come to its death, here in the forest, by this lovely river?
<p/>Was it not due to this death, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was now like a child, so full of trust, so without fear, so full of joy?
<p/>Now Siddhartha also got some idea of why he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had fought this self in vain as a Brahman, as a penitent.
<p/>Too much knowledge had held him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) back, too many holy verses, too many sacrificial rules, to much self-castigation, so much doing and striving for that goal!
<p/>Full of arrogance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had been, always the smartest, always working the most, always one step ahead of all others, always the knowing and spiritual one, always the priest or wise one.
<p/>Into being a priest, into this arrogance, into this spirituality, his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) self had retreated, there it sat firmly and grew, while he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) would kill it by fasting and penance.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) saw it and saw that the secret voice had been right, that no teacher would ever have been able to bring about his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) salvation.
<p/>Therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had to go out into the world, lose himself to lust and power, to woman and money, had to become a merchant, a dice-gambler, a drinker, and a greedy person, until the priest and Samana in him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was dead.
<p/>Therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had to continue bearing these ugly years, bearing the disgust, the teachings, the pointlessness of a dreary and wasted life up to the end, up to bitter despair, until Siddhartha the lustful, Siddhartha the greedy could also die.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had died, a new Siddhartha had woken up from the sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) would also grow old, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) would also eventually have to die, mortal was Siddhartha, mortal was every physical form.
<p/>But today he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was young, was a child, the new Siddhartha, and was full of joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought these thoughts, listened with a smile to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) stomach, listened gratefully to a buzzing bee.
<p/>Cheerfully, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) looked into the rushing river, never before he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had liked a water so well as this one, never before he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had perceived the voice and the parable of the moving water thus strongly and beautifully.
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), as if the river had something special to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), something he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) did not know yet, which was still awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>But the new Siddhartha felt a deep love for this rushing water, and decided for himself, not to leave it very soon.
<p/>In this river, Siddhartha had intended to drown himself, in it the old, tired, desperate Siddhartha had drowned today. THE FERRYMAN
<p/>By this river I want to stay, thought Siddhartha, it is the same which I have crossed a long time ago on my way to the childlike people
<p/>, a friendly ferryman had guided me then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is the one I want to go to, starting out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hut, my path had led me at that time into a new life, which had now grown old and is dead--my present path, my present new life, shall also take its start there!
<p/>Tenderly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) looked into the rushing water, into the transparent green, into the crystal lines of its drawing, so rich in secrets.
<p/>Bright pearls he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw rising from the deep, quiet bubbles of air floating on the reflecting surface, the blue of the sky being depicted in it.
<p/>With a thousand eyes, the river looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), with green ones, with white ones, with crystal ones, with sky-blue ones.
<p/>How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) love this water , how did it delight him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), how grateful was he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to it! In his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heard the voice talking, which was newly awaking, and it told him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>): Love this water!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) who would understand this water and its secrets, so it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), would also understand many other things, many secrets, all secrets.
<p/>Stay near it! Learn from it! Oh yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wanted to learn from it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wanted to listen to it. But out of all secrets of the river, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) today only saw one, this one touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) soul.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw: this water ran and ran, incessantly it ran, and was nevertheless always there, was always at all times the same and yet new in every moment!
<p/>Great be he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) who would grasp this, understand this! He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) understood and grasped it not, only felt some idea of it stirring, a distant memory, divine voices.
<p/>In a daze he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) walked on, up the path by the bank, upriver, listened to the current, listened to the rumbling hunger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) body.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) reached the ferry, the boat was just ready, and the same ferryman who had once transported the young Samana across the river, stood in the boat, Siddhartha recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had also aged very much.
<p/>Siddhartha rose, the workings of hunger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) body became unbearable. '' Would you like to ferry me over? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) asked.
<p/>The ferryman, being astonished to see such an elegant man walking along and on foot, took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boat and pushed it off the bank.
<p/>'' It's a beautiful life you have chosen for yourself,'' the passenger spoke. '' It must be beautiful to live by this water every day and to cruise on it.
<p/>'' With a smile, the man at the oar moved from side to side: <div class="bookquote">``It is beautiful, sir, it is as you say.
<p/>But isn't every life, isn't every work beautiful?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This may be true. But I envy you for yours.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you would soon stop enjoying it.
<p/>This is nothing for people wearing fine clothes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha laughed. '' Once before, I have been looked upon today because of my clothes, I have been looked upon with distrust.
<p/>Wouldn't you, ferryman, like to accept these clothes, which are a nuisance to me, from me? For you must know, I have no money to pay your fare.''
<p/>Behold, once before you have ferried me across this water in your boat for the immaterial reward of a good deed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're joking, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ferryman</b></font>)</div>the ferryman laughed. '' I'm not joking, friend. Thus, do it today as well, and accept my clothes for it.''
<p/>'' And do you, sir, intent to continue travelling without clothes?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, most of all I wouldn't want to continue travelling at all.
<p/>Most of all I would like you, ferryman, to give me an old loincloth and kept me with you as your assistant, or rather as your trainee, for I'll have to learn first how to handle the boat.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the ferryman</b></font>)</div>For a long time, the ferryman looked at the stranger, searching. '' Now I recognise you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) finally said. ''
<p/>At one time, you've slept in my hut, this was a long time ago, possibly more than twenty years ago, and you've been ferried across the river by me, and we parted like good friends.
<p/>Haven't you've been a Samana? I can't think of your name any more.'' '' My name is Siddhartha, and I was a Samana, when you've last seen me.''
<p/>You will, so I hope, be my guest today as well and sleep in my hut, and tell me, where you're coming from and why these beautiful clothes are such a nuisance to you.
<p/>They had reached the middle of the river, and Vasudeva pushed the oar with more strength, in order to overcome the current.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So be welcome, Siddhartha. My name is Vasudeva. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) worked calmly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes fixed in on the front of the boat, with brawny arms.
<p/>Siddhartha sat and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and remembered, how once before, on that last day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) time as a Samana, love for this man had stirred in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart.
<p/>When they had reached the bank, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to tie the boat to the stakes; after this, the ferryman asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to enter the hut, offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) bread and water, and Siddhartha ate with eager pleasure, and also ate with eager pleasure of the mango fruits, Vasudeva offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>Afterwards, it was almost the time of the sunset, they sat on a log by the bank, and Siddhartha told the ferryman about where he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) originally came from and about his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had seen it before his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes today, in that hour of despair.
<p/>Listening carefully, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) let everything enter his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mind, birthplace and childhood, all that learning, all that searching, all joy, all distress.
<p/>Gratefully, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) accepted Vasudeva's invitation. Until late at night, lasted his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) tale. Vasudeva listened with great attention. This was among the ferryman's virtues one of the greatest: like only a few, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) knew how to listen.
<p/>Without him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) having spoken a word, the speaker sensed how Vasudeva let his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) words enter his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) mind, quiet, open, waiting, how he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) did not lose a single one, awaited not a single one with impatience, did not add his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) praise or rebuke, was just listening.
<p/>Siddhartha felt, what a happy fortune it is, to confess to such a listener, to bury in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) own life, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) own search, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) own suffering.
<p/>But in the end of Siddhartha's tale, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) spoke of the tree by the river, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) deep fall, of the holy Om, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had felt such a love for the river after his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) slumber, the ferryman listened with twice the attention, entirely and completely absorbed by it, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes closed.
<p/>But when Siddhartha fell silent, and a long silence had occurred, then Vasudeva said: <div class="bookquote">``It is as I thought. The river has spoken to you.
<p/>It is your friend as well , it speaks to you as well. That is good, that is very good. Stay with me, Siddhartha, my friend.
<p/>I used to have a wife, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bed was next to mine, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has died a long time ago, for a long time, I have lived alone.
<p/>Now, you shall live with me, there is space and food for both.''  (<font color='red'><b>Vasudeva</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>said Siddhartha, <div class="bookquote">``I thank you and accept.
<p/>And I also thank you for this, Vasudeva, for listening to me so well! These people are rare who know how to listen.
<p/>And I did not meet a single one who knew it as well as you did. I will also learn in this respect from you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will learn it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vasudeva</b></font>)</div>spoke Vasudeva, <div class="bookquote">``but not from me. The river has taught me to listen, from it you will learn it as well.
<p/>See, you've already learned this from the water too, that it is good to strive downwards, to sink, to seek depth.
<p/>The rich and elegant Siddhartha is becoming an oarsman's servant, the learned Brahman Siddhartha becomes a ferryman: this has also been told to you by the river.
<p/>It knows everything, the river, everything can be learned from it. You'll learn that other thing from it as well. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vasudeva</b></font>)</div><p/>Quoth Siddhartha after a long pause: <div class="bookquote">``What other thing, Vasudeva? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Quoth Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Vasudeva rose. '' It is late,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``let's go to sleep.
<p/>I can't tell you that other thing, oh friend. You'll learn it, or perhaps you know it already. See, I'm no learned man, I have no special skill in speaking, I also have no special skill in thinking.
<p/>If I was able to say and teach it, I might be a wise man, but like this I am only a ferryman, and it is my task to ferry people across the river.
<p/>I have transported many, thousands; and to all of them, my river has been nothing but an obstacle on their travels.
<p/>They travelled to seek money and business, and for weddings, and on pilgrimages, and the river was obstructing their path, and the ferryman's job was to get them quickly across that obstacle.
<p/>But for some among thousands, a few, four or five, the river has stopped being an obstacle, they have heard its voice, they have listened to it, and the river has become sacred to them, as it has become sacred to me.
<p/>All I'm able to do is to listen and to be godly, I have learned nothing else. Let's rest now, Siddhartha.
<p/>Siddhartha stayed with the ferryman and learned to operate the boat, and when there was nothing to do at the ferry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) worked with Vasudeva in the rice-field, gathered wood, plucked the fruit off the banana-trees.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) learned to build an oar, and learned to mend the boat, and to weave baskets, and was joyful because of everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) learned, and the days and months passed quickly.
<p/>Most of all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) learned from it to listen, to pay close attention with a quiet heart, with a waiting, opened soul, without passion, without a wish, without judgement, without an opinion.
<p/>In a friendly manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) lived side by side with Vasudeva, and occasionally they exchanged some words, few and at length thought about words.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But more than Vasudeva could teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was taught by the river. Incessantly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) learned from it. Vasudeva was no friend of words; rarely, Siddhartha succeeded in persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to speak.
<p/>Did you,'' so he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) at one time, <div class="bookquote">``did you too learn that secret from the river: that there is no time?
<p/>It is this what you mean, isn't it: that the river is everywhere at once, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the sea, in the mountains, everywhere at once, and that there is only the present time for it, not the shadow of the past, not the shadow of the future?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Vasudeva's face was filled with a bright smile. '' Yes, Siddhartha,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) spoke. '' '' This it is,'' said Siddhartha.
<p/>And when I had learned it, I looked at my life, and it was also a river, and the boy Siddhartha was only separated from the man Siddhartha and from the old man Siddhartha by a shadow, not by something real.
<p/>'' Also, Siddhartha's previous births were no past, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) death and his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) return to Brahma was no future. Nothing was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has existence and is present.''
<p/>Oh, was not all suffering time, were not all forms of tormenting oneself and being afraid time, was not everything hard, everything hostile in the world gone and overcome as soon as one had overcome time, as soon as time would have been put out of existence by one's thoughts?
<p/>In ecstatic delight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had spoken, but Vasudeva smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) brightly and nodded in confirmation; silently he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) nodded, brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hand over Siddhartha's shoulder, turned back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) work.
<p/>And once again, when the river had just increased its flow in the rainy season and made a powerful noise, then said Siddhartha: <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it so, oh friend, the river has many voices, very many voices?
<p/>Hasn't it the voice of a king, and of a warrior, and of a bull, and of a bird of the night, and of a woman giving birth, and of a sighing man, and a thousand other voices more?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div><p/>Siddhartha spoke with ecstasy; deeply, this enlightenment had delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>). '' So it is,'' Vasudeva nodded, <div class="bookquote">``all voices of the creatures are in its voice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Vasudeva</b></font>)</div><p/>And do you know,'' Siddhartha continued, <div class="bookquote">``what word it speaks, when you succeed in hearing all of its ten thousand voices at once?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Happily, Vasudeva's face was smiling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) bent over to Siddhartha and spoke the holy Om into his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) ear. And this had been the very thing which Siddhartha had also been hearing.
<p/>And time after time, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) smile became more similar to the ferryman's, became almost just as bright, almost just as throughly glowing with bliss, just as shining out of thousand small wrinkles, just as alike to a child's, just as alike to an old man's.
<p/>Often, they sat in the evening together by the bank on the log, said nothing and both listened to the water, which was no water to them, but the voice of life, the voice of what exists, of what is eternally taking shape.
<p/>And it happened from time to time that both, when listening to the river, thought of the same things, of a conversation from the day before yesterday, of one of their travellers, the face and fate of whom had occupied their thoughts, of death, of their childhood, and that they both in the same moment, when the river had been saying something good to them, looked at each other, both thinking precisely the same thing, both delighted about the same answer to the same question.
<p/>There was something about this ferry and the two ferrymen which was transmitted to others, which many of the travellers felt.
<p/>It happened occasionally that a traveller, after having looked at the face of one of the ferrymen, started to tell the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) life, told about pains, confessed evil things, asked for comfort and advice.
<p/>Many travellers, seeing the two ferrymen, thought they were brothers. It happened occasionally that someone asked for permission to stay for a night with them to listen to the river.
<p/>It also happened that curious people came, who had been told that there were two wise men, or sorcerers, or holy men living by that ferry.
<p/>The curious people asked many questions, but they got no answers, and they found neither sorcerers nor wise men, they only found two friendly little old men, who seemed to be mute and to have become a bit strange and gaga.
<p/>And the curious people laughed and were discussing how foolishly and gullibly the common people were spreading such empty rumours. The years passed by, and nobody counted them.
<p/>Then, at one time, monks came by on a pilgrimage, followers of Gotama, the Buddha, who were asking to be ferried across the river, and by them the ferrymen were told that they were most hurriedly walking back to their great teacher, for the news had spread
<p/>the exalted one was deadly sick and would soon die his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) last human death, in order to become one with the salvation.
<p/>It was not long, until a new flock of monks came along on their pilgrimage, and another one, and the monks as well as most of the other travellers and people walking through the land spoke of nothing else than of Gotama and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) impending death.
<p/>And as people are flocking from everywhere and from all sides, when they are going to war or to the coronation of a king, and are gathering like ants in droves, thus they flocked, like being drawn on by a magic spell, to where the great Buddha was awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) death, where the huge event was to take place and the great perfected one of an era was to become one with the glory.
<p/>Often, Siddhartha thought in those days of the dying wise man, the great teacher, whose voice had admonished nations and had awoken hundreds of thousands, whose voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had also once heard, whose holy face he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had also once seen with respect.
<p/>Kindly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) path to perfection before his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes, and remembered with a smile those words which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had once, as a young man, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), the exalted one.
<p/>For a long time he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) knew that there was nothing standing between Gotama and him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) any more, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was still unable to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) teachings.
<p/>They had been, so it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), proud and precocious words; with a smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) remembered them. No, there was no teaching a truly searching person, someone who truly wanted to find, could accept.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) who had found, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could approve of any teachings, every path, every goal, there was nothing standing between him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) and all the other thousand any more who lived in that what is eternal, who breathed what is divine.
<p/>On one of these days, when so many went on a pilgrimage to the dying Buddha, Kamala also went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>), who used to be the most beautiful of the courtesans.
<p/>A long time ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) had retired from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) previous life, had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) garden to the monks of Gotama as a gift, had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) refuge in the teachings, was among the friends and benefactors of the pilgrims.
<p/>Together with Siddhartha the boy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) son, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) had gone on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) way due to the news of the near death of Gotama, in simple clothes, on foot.
<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) little son, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) was travelling by the river; but the boy had soon grown tired, desired to go back home, desired to rest, desired to eat, became disobedient and started whining.
<p/>Kamala often had to take a rest with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was accustomed to having his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way against her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) had to feed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), had to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), had to scold him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not comprehend why he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had to go on this exhausting and sad pilgrimage with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, to an unknown place, to a stranger, who was holy and about to die.
<p/>So what if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) died, how did this concern the boy? The pilgrims were getting close to Vasudeva's ferry, when little Siddhartha once again forced his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mother to rest.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Kamala herself, had also become tired, and while the boy was chewing a banana, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) crouched down on the ground, closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) eyes a bit, and rested.
<p/>But suddenly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) uttered a wailing scream, the boy looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) in fear and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) face having grown pale from horror; and from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) dress, a small, black snake fled, by which Kamala had been bitten.
<p/>Hurriedly, they now both ran along the path, in order to reach people, and got near to the ferry, there Kamala collapsed, and was not able to go any further.
<p/>But the boy started crying miserably, only interrupting it to kiss and hug his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) also joined his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) loud screams for help, until the sound reached Vasudeva's ears, who stood at the ferry.
<p/>Quickly, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came walking, took the woman on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arms, carried her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into the boat, the boy ran along, and soon they all reached the hut, were Siddhartha stood by the stove and was just lighting the fire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) looked up and first saw the boy's face, which wondrously reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) of something, like a warning to remember something he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had forgotten.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw Kamala, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) instantly recognised, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) lay unconscious in the ferryman's arms, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own son, whose face had been such a warning reminder to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and the heart stirred in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chest.
<p/>Kamala's wound was washed, but had already turned black and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) body was swollen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) was made to drink a healing potion.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) consciousness returned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) lay on Siddhartha's bed in the hut and bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) stood Siddhartha, who used to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) so much.
<p/>It seemed like a dream to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>); with a smile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) friend's face; just slowly she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>), realized her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) situation, remembered the bite, called timidly for the boy.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s with you, don't worry,'' said Siddhartha. Kamala looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) spoke with a heavy tongue, paralysed by the poison.
<p/>But you are like the young Samana, who at one time came without clothes, with dusty feet, to me into the garden.
<p/>You are much more like him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), than you were like him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) at that time when you had left me and Kamaswami.
<p/>'' You've become old, my dear,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you've become gray. In the eyes, you're like him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), Siddhartha. Alas, I have also grown old, old--could you still recognise me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Siddhartha smiled: <div class="bookquote">``Instantly, I recognised you, Kamala, my dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Kamala pointed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) boy and said: <div class="bookquote">``Did you recognise him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as well?
<p/>The boy wept, Siddhartha took him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) knees, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) weep, petted his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hair, and at the sight of the child's face, a Brahman prayer came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mind, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had learned a long time ago, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had been a little boy himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is your son. ''  (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) eyes became confused and fell shut. Slowly, with a singing voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) started to speak; from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) past and childhood, the words came flowing to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>And with that singsong, the boy became calm, was only now and then uttering a sob and fell asleep. Siddhartha placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) on Vasudeva's bed.
<p/>Vasudeva stood by the stove and cooked rice. Siddhartha gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) a look, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) returned with a smile. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Vasudeva</b></font>)'ll die,'' Siddhartha said quietly.
<p/>Vasudeva nodded; over his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) friendly face ran the light of the stove's fire. Once again, Kamala returned to consciousness. Pain distorted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) face, Siddhartha's eyes read the suffering on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) mouth, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) pale cheeks.
<p/>Quietly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) read it, attentively, waiting, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mind becoming one with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) suffering. Kamala felt it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) gaze sought his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Now I see that your eyes have changed as well. They've become completely different. By what do I still recognise that you're Siddhartha?
<p/>It's you, and it's not you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha said nothing, quietly his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes looked at hers. '' You have achieved it?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) asked. '' You have found peace?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) smiled and placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hand on hers. '' I'm seeing it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm seeing it.
<p/>I too will find peace.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have found it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha spoke in a whisper. Kamala never stopped looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) thought about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) pilgrimage to Gotama, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) wanted to take, in order to see the face of the perfected one, to breathe his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) peace, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) had now found him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) place, and that it was good, just as good, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) had seen the other one.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) wanted to tell this to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), but the tongue no longer obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) will. Without speaking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw the life fading from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>When the final pain filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) eyes and made them grow dim, when the final shiver ran through her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) limbs, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) finger closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) eyelids.
<p/>For a long time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) mouth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) old, tired mouth, with those lips, which had become thin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) remembered, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) used to, in the spring of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) years, compare this mouth with a freshly cracked fig.
<p/>For a long time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) sat, read in the pale face, in the tired wrinkles, filled himself with this sight, saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) own face lying in the same manner, just as white, just as quenched out, and saw at the same time his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) face and hers being young, with red lips, with fiery eyes, and the feeling of this both being present and at the same time real, the feeling of eternity, completely filled every aspect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) being.
<p/>Deeply he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt, more deeply than ever before, in this hour, the indestructibility of every life, the eternity of every moment.
<p/>For a long time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) sat and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) peacefully dead face. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) rose, Vasudeva had prepared rice for him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>In the stable, where their goat stood, the two old men prepared beds of straw for themselves, and Vasudeva lay himself down to sleep.
<p/>But Siddhartha went outside and sat this night before the hut, listening to the river, surrounded by the past, touched and encircled by all times of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life at the same time.
<p/>But Siddhartha did not eat. But occasionally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) rose, stepped to the door of the hut and listened, whether the boy was sleeping.
<p/>Early in the morning, even before the sun could be seen, Vasudeva came out of the stable and walked over to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) friend.
<p/>'' You haven't slept,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. '' No, Vasudeva. I sat here, I was listening to the river. A lot it has told me, deeply it has filled me with the healing thought, with the thought of oneness.''
<p/>'' You've experienced suffering, Siddhartha, but I see: no sadness has entered your heart.'' '' No, my dear, how should I be sad?
<p/>I, who have been rich and happy, have become even richer and happier now. My son has been given to me.''
<p/>'' Your son shall be welcome to me as well. But now, Siddhartha, let's get to work, there is much to be done.
<p/>Let us also build Kamala's funeral pile on the same hill on which I had then built my wife's funeral pile.
<p/>Kamala has died on the same bed, on which my wife had died a long time ago. '' While the boy was still asleep, they built the funeral pile.
<p/>THE SON Timid and weeping, the boy had attended his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother's funeral; gloomy and shy, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had listened to Siddhartha, who greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son and welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) place in Vasudeva's hut.
<p/>Pale, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) sat for many days by the hill of the dead, did not want to eat, gave no open look, did not open his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart, met his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) fate with resistance and denial.
<p/>Siddhartha spared him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) pleased, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) honoured his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mourning. Siddhartha understood that his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) like a father.
<p/>Slowly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) also saw and understood that the eleven-year-old was a pampered boy, a mother's boy, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had grown up in the habits of rich people, accustomed to finer food, to a soft bed, accustomed to giving orders to servants.
<p/>Siddhartha understood that the mourning, pampered child could not suddenly and willingly be content with a life among strangers and in poverty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) did not force him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) did many a chore for him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), always picked the best piece of the meal for him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>Slowly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hoped to win him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) over, by friendly patience. Rich and happy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) had called himself, when the boy had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>Since time had passed on in the meantime, and the boy remained a stranger and in a gloomy disposition, since he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) displayed a proud and stubbornly disobedient heart, did not want to do any work, did not pay his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) respect to the old men, stole from Vasudeva's fruit-trees, then Siddhartha began to understand that his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son had not brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) happiness and peace, but suffering and worry.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) preferred the suffering and worries of love over happiness and joy without the boy. Since young Siddhartha was in the hut, the old men had split the work.
<p/>Vasudeva had again taken on the job of the ferryman all by himself, and Siddhartha, in order to be with his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son, did the work in the hut and the field.
<p/>For a long time, for long months, Siddhartha waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son to understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) love, to perhaps reciprocate it.
<p/>One day, when Siddhartha the younger had once again tormented his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father very much with spite and an unsteadiness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wishes and had broken both of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) rice-bowls, Vasudeva took in the evening his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) friend aside and talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>For long months, Vasudeva waited, watching, waited and said nothing. '' Pardon me. '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``from a friendly heart, I'm talking to you.
<p/>I'm seeing that you are tormenting yourself, I'm seeing that you're in grief. Your son, my dear, is worrying you, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is also worrying me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has not, like you, ran away from riches and the city, being disgusted and fed up with it; against his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had to leave all this behind.
<p/>That young bird is accustomed to a different life, to a different nest. I asked the river, oh friend, many times I have asked it.
<p/>But the river laughs, it laughs at me, it laughs at you and me, and is shaking with laughter at our foolishness.
<p/>Water wants to join water, youth wants to join youth, your son is not in the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) can prosper.
<p/>You too should ask the river; you too should listen to it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Troubled, Siddhartha looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) friendly face, in the many wrinkles of which there was incessant cheerfulness.
<p/>See, I'm fighting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), I'm seeking to win his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart, with love and with friendly patience I intent to capture it.
<p/>'' How could I part with him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) said quietly, ashamed. <div class="bookquote">``Give me some more time, my dear! One day, the river shall also talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) also is called upon.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Vasudeva</b></font>)</div>Vasudeva's smile flourished more warmly. '' Oh yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) too is called upon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) too is of the eternal life.
<p/>But do we, you and me, know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is called upon to do, what path to take, what actions to perform, what pain to endure?
<p/>Not a small one, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) pain will be; after all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart is proud and hard, people like this have to suffer a lot, err a lot, do much injustice, burden themselves with much sin.
<p/>Tell me, my dear: you're not taking control of your son's upbringing? You don't force him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)? You don't beat him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)? You don't punish him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)?''
<p/>You don't force him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), don't beat him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), don't give him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) orders, because you know that `soft' is stronger than `hard', water stronger than rocks, love stronger than force.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Vasudeva, I don't do anything of this.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I knew it. Very good, I praise you. But aren't you mistaken in thinking that you wouldn't force him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), wouldn't punish him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)?
<p/>Don't you make him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) feel inferior every day, and don't you make it even harder on him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with your kindness and patience?
<p/>Don't you force him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), the arrogant and pampered boy, to live in a hut with two old banana-eaters, to whom even rice is a delicacy, whose thoughts can't be his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), whose hearts are old and quiet and beats in a different pace than his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)?
<p/>Don't you shackle him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with your love? Isn't forced, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) punished by all this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Troubled, Siddhartha looked to the ground.
<p/>: ``Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) into the city, bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mother's house, there'll still be servants around, give him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to them.
<p/>And when there aren't any around any more, bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to a teacher, not for the teachings' sake, but so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) shall be among other boys, and among girls, and in the world which is his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) own.
<p/>Quietly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) asked: <div class="bookquote">``What do you think should I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Quoth Vasudeva Have you never thought of this?'' '' You're seeing into my heart,'' Siddhartha spoke sadly.
<p/>'' Often, I have thought of this. But look, how shall I put him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), who had no tender heart anyhow, into this world?
<p/>Won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) become exuberant, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) lose himself to pleasure and power, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) repeat all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father's mistakes, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) perhaps get entirely lost in Sansara?''
<p/>Brightly, the ferryman's smile lit up; softly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) touched Siddhartha's arm and said: <div class="bookquote">``Ask the river about it, my friend! Hear it laugh about it!
<p/>Would you actually believe that you had committed your foolish acts in order to spare your son from committing them too?
<p/>My dear, have you entirely forgotten that story, that story containing so many lessons, that story about Siddhartha, a Brahman's son, which you once told me here on this very spot?
<p/>And could you in any way protect your son from Sansara? How could you? By means of teachings, prayer, admonition? Who has kept the Samana Siddhartha safe from Sansara, from sin, from greed, from foolishness?
<p/>Which father, which teacher had been able to protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) from living his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life for himself, from soiling himself with life, from burdening himself with guilt, from drinking the bitter drink for himself, from finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) path for himself?
<p/>Were his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father's religious devotion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) teachers warnings, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) own knowledge, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) own search able to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) safe? Would you think, my dear, anybody might perhaps be spared from taking this path?
<p/>That perhaps your little son would be spared, because you love him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), because you would like to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) from suffering and pain and disappointment?
<p/>But even if you would die ten times for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), you would not be able to take the slightest part of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) destiny upon yourself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Never before, Vasudeva had spoken so many words. Kindly, Siddhartha thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), went troubled into the hut, could not sleep for a long time.
<p/>Vasudeva had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had not already thought and known for himself. But this was a knowledge he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could not act upon, stronger than the knowledge
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) ever lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart so much to something, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) ever loved any person thus, thus blindly, thus sufferingly, thus unsuccessfully, and yet thus happily?
<p/>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) love for the boy, stronger was his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) tenderness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) fear to lose him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>). Siddhartha could not heed his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) friend's advice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could not give up the boy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) let the boy give him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) orders, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) disregard him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) said nothing and waited; daily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) began the mute struggle of friendliness, the silent war of patience.
<p/>At one time, when the boy's face reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) very much of Kamala, Siddhartha suddenly had to think of a line which Kamala a long time ago, in the days of their youth, had once said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>You cannot love,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) and had compared himself with a star, while comparing the childlike people with falling leaves, and nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had also sensed an accusation in that line.
<p/>Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had never been able to lose or devote himself completely to another person, to forget himself, to commit foolish acts for the love of another person; never he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had been able to do this, and this was, as it had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) at that time, the great distinction which set him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) apart from the childlike people.
<p/>But now, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son was here, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), Siddhartha, had also become completely a childlike person, suffering for the sake of another person, loving another person, lost to a love, having become a fool on account of love.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) too felt, late, once in his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) lifetime, this strongest and strangest of all passions, suffered from it, suffered miserably, and was nevertheless in bliss, was nevertheless renewed in one respect, enriched by one thing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) did sense very well that this love, this blind love for his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) son, was a passion, something very human, that it was Sansara, a murky source, dark waters.
<p/>Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) felt at the same time, it was not worthless, it was necessary, came from the essence of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own being.
<p/>This pleasure also had to be atoned for, this pain also had to be endured, these foolish acts also had to be committed.
<p/>Through all this, the son let him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) commit his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) foolish acts, let him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) court for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) affection, let him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) humiliate himself every day by giving in to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) moods.
<p/>Vasudeva also said nothing and waited, friendly, knowing, patient. They were both masters of patience. '' This father had nothing which would have delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and nothing which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have feared.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a good man, this father, a good, kind, soft man, perhaps a very devout man, perhaps a saint, all these were no attributes which could win the boy over.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was bored by this father, who kept him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) prisoner here in this miserable hut of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was bored by him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to answer every naughtiness with a smile, every insult with friendliness, every viciousness with kindness, this very thing was the hated trick of this old sneak.
<p/>Much more the boy would have liked it if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been threatened by him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been abused by him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>A day came, when what young Siddhartha had on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mind came bursting forth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) openly turned against his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father.
<p/>But the boy did not leave the hut, in stubborn disobedience and rage he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stayed where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was, thumped on the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feet, clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fists, and screamed in a powerful outburst his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hatred and contempt into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's face.
<p/>The latter had given him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a task, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to gather brushwood. '' Get the brushwood for yourself!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shouted foaming at the mouth, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not your servant.
<p/>I do know, that you won't hit me, you don't dare; I do know, that you constantly want to punish me and put me down with your religious devotion and your indulgence.
<p/>But I, listen up, just to make you suffer, I rather want to become a highway-robber and murderer, and go to hell, than to become like you!
<p/>You want me to become like you, just as devout, just as soft, just as wise! I hate you, you're not my father, and if you've ten times been my mother's fornicator!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Rage and grief boiled over in him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), foamed at the father in a hundred savage and evil words. Then the boy ran away and only returned late at night.
<p/>What had also disappeared was a small basket, woven out of bast of two colours, in which the ferrymen kept those copper and silver coins which they received as a fare.
<p/>But the next morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had disappeared. The boat had also disappeared, Siddhartha saw it lying by the opposite bank. The boy had ran away.
<p/>I must follow him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),'' said Siddhartha, who had been shivering with grief since those ranting speeches, the boy had made yesterday.
<p/>'' '' A child can't go through the forest all alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll perish. We must build a raft, Vasudeva, to get over the water.''
<p/>But him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), you shall let run along, my friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is no child any more, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knows how to get around.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will build a raft,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vasudeva</b></font>)</div>said Vasudeva, <div class="bookquote">``to get our boat back, which the boy has taken away. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s looking for the path to the city, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is right, don't forget that.
<p/>Alas, Siddhartha, I see you suffering, but you're suffering a pain at which one would like to laugh, at which you'll soon laugh for yourself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)'s doing what you've failed to do yourself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)'s taking care of himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)'s taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) course. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Vasudeva</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha did not answer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) already held the axe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hands and began to make a raft of bamboo, and Vasudeva helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to tie the canes together with ropes of grass.
<p/>Then they crossed over, drifted far off their course, pulled the raft upriver on the opposite bank. '' Why did you take the axe along?'' asked Siddhartha.
<p/>Vasudeva said: <div class="bookquote">``It might have been possible that the oar of our boat got lost.''  (<font color='red'><b>Vasudeva</b></font>)</div>But Siddhartha knew what his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) friend was thinking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought, the boy would have thrown away or broken the oar in order to get even and in order to keep them from following him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>Vasudeva pointed to the bottom of the boat and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) friend with a smile, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wanted to say: <div class="bookquote">``Don't you see what your son is trying to tell you?
<p/>And in fact, there was no oar left in the boat. Don't you see that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) doesn't want to be followed?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did not say this in words. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) started making a new oar. But Siddhartha bid his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) farewell, to look for the run-away.
<p/>When Siddhartha had already been walking through the forest for a long time, the thought occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) search was useless.
<p/>Either, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought, the boy was far ahead and had already reached the city, or, if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should still be on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would conceal himself from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), the pursuer.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) continued thinking, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) also found that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) part, was not worried for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) son, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew deep inside that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had neither perished nor was in any danger in the forest.
<p/>Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ran without stopping, no longer to save him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), just to satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) desire, just to perhaps see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) one more time.
<p/>When, near the city, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) reached a wide road, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stopped, by the entrance of the beautiful pleasure-garden, which used to belong to Kamala, where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>) sedan-chair.
<p/>The past rose up in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) soul, again he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw himself standing there, young, a bearded, naked Samana, the hair full of dust.
<p/>For a long time, Siddhartha stood there and looked through the open gate into the garden, seeing monks in yellow robes walking among the beautiful trees.
<p/>Vasudeva did not stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) ran up to just outside of the city. For a long time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) stood there, pondering, seeing images, listening to the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life.
<p/>For a long time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) stood there, looked at the monks, saw young Siddhartha in their place, saw young Kamala walking among the high trees.
<p/>Clearly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw himself being served food and drink by Kamala, receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) first kiss from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kamala</b></font>), looking proudly and disdainfully back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) Brahmanism, beginning proudly and full of desire his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) worldly life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw Kamaswami, saw the servants, the orgies, the gamblers with the dice, the musicians, saw Kamala's song-bird in the cage, lived through all this once again, breathed Sansara, was once again old and tired, felt once again disgust, felt once again the wish to annihilate himself, was once again healed by the holy Om.
<p/>After having been standing by the gate of the garden for a long time, Siddhartha realised that his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) desire was foolish, which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) go up to this place, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could not help his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was not allowed to cling him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>Deeply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt the love for the run-away in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart, like a wound, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt at the same time that this wound had not been given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) in order to turn the knife in it, that it had to become a blossom and had to shine.
<p/>That this wound did not blossom yet, did not shine yet, at this hour, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) sad. Instead of the desired goal, which had drawn him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) here following the runaway son, there was now emptiness.
<p/>Sadly, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sat down, felt something dying in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heart, experienced emptiness, saw no joy any more, no goal. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sat lost in thought and waited.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sat and listened, in the dust of the road, listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heart, beating tiredly and sadly, waited for a voice.
<p/>Many an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) crouched, listening, saw no images any more, fell into emptiness, let himself fall, without seeing a path.
<p/>This he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had learned by the river, this one thing: waiting, having patience, listening attentively. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) felt the wound burning, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) silently spoke the Om, filled himself with Om.
<p/>The monks in the garden saw him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and since he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) crouched for many hours, and dust was gathering on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) gray hair, one of them came to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and placed two bananas in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>The old man did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). From this petrified state, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was awoken by a hand touching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder. Instantly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognised this touch, this tender, bashful touch, and regained his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked into Vasudeva's friendly face, into the small wrinkles, which were as if they were filled with nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smile, into the happy eyes, then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled too.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the bananas lying in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), picked them up, gave one to the ferryman, ate the other one himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose and greeted Vasudeva, who had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). After this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) silently went back into the forest with Vasudeva, returned home to the ferry.
<p/>Neither one talked about what had happened today, neither one mentioned the boy's name, neither one spoke about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) running away, neither one spoke about the wound.
<p/>In the hut, Siddhartha lay down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) bed, and when after a while Vasudeva came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) a bowl of coconut-milk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) already found him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) asleep.
<p/>Many a traveller Siddhartha had to ferry across the river who was accompanied by a son or a daughter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw none of them without envying him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), without thinking: <div class="bookquote">``So many, so many thousands possess this sweetest of good fortunes--
<p/>Even bad people, even thieves and robbers have children and love them, and are being loved by them, all except for me.
<p/>OM For a long time, the wound continued to burn. why don't I? ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Thus simply, thus without reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) now thought, thus similar to the childlike people he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had become.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) ferried travellers of the ordinary kind, childlike people, businessmen, warriors, women, these people did not seem alien to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) as they used to: he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) understood them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) understood and shared their life, which was not guided by thoughts and insight, but solely by urges and wishes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt like them.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was near perfection and was bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) final wound, it still seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) as if those childlike people were his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) brothers, their vanities, desires for possession, and ridiculous aspects were no longer ridiculous to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), became understandable, became lovable, even became worthy of veneration to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>).
<p/>The blind love of a mother for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child, the stupid, blind pride of a conceited father for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only son, the blind, wild desire of a young, vain woman for jewelry and admiring glances from men, all of these urges, all of this childish stuff, all of these simple, foolish, but immensely strong, strongly living, strongly prevailing urges and desires were now no childish notions for Siddhartha any more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw people living for their sake, saw them achieving infinitely much for their sake, travelling, conducting wars, suffering infinitely much, bearing infinitely much, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could love them for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw life, that what is alive, the indestructible, the Brahman in each of their passions, each of their acts.
<p/>Differently than before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) now looked upon people, less smart, less proud, but instead warmer, more curious, more involved. Worthy of love and admiration were these people in their blind loyalty, their blind strength and tenacity.
<p/>They lacked nothing, there was nothing the knowledgeable one, the thinker, had to put him (<font color='blue'><b>thinker</b></font>) above them except for one little thing, a single, tiny, small thing: the consciousness, the conscious thought of the oneness of all life.
<p/>And Siddhartha even doubted in many an hour, whether this knowledge, this thought was to be valued thus highly, whether it might not also perhaps be a childish idea of the thinking people, of the thinking and childlike people.
<p/>In all other respects, the worldly people were of equal rank to the wise men, were often far superior to them, just as animals too can, after all, in some moments, seem to be superior to humans in their tough, unrelenting performance of what is necessary.
<p/>Slowly blossomed, slowly ripened in Siddhartha the realisation, the knowledge, what wisdom actually was, what the goal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) long search was.
<p/>It was nothing but a readiness of the soul, an ability, a secret art, to think every moment, while living his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life, the thought of oneness, to be able to feel and inhale the oneness.
<p/>Slowly this blossomed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), was shining back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) from Vasudeva's old, childlike face: harmony, knowledge of the eternal perfection of the world, smiling, oneness.
<p/>But the wound still burned, longingly and bitterly Siddhartha thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son, nurtured his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) love and tenderness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart, allowed the pain to gnaw at him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), committed all foolish acts of love.
<p/>And one day, when the wound burned violently, Siddhartha ferried across the river, driven by a yearning, got off the boat and was willing to go to the city and to look for his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son.
<p/>Not by itself, this flame would go out. The river flowed softly and quietly, it was the dry season, but its voice sounded strange: it laughed!
<p/>Siddhartha stopped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) bent over the water, in order to hear even better, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) face reflected in the quietly moving waters, and in this reflected face there was something, which reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), something he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had forgotten, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) found it:
<p/>It laughed clearly. The river laughed, it laughed brightly and clearly at the old ferryman. this face resembled another face, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) used to know and love and also fear.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), a long time ago, as a young man, had forced his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father to let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go to the penitents, how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had bid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) farewell to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone and had never come back.
<p/>It resembled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's face, the Brahman. Had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father not also suffered the same pain for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now suffered for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son?
<p/>Had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father not long since died, alone, without having seen his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son again? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not have to expect the same fate for himself?
<p/>Was it not a comedy, a strange and stupid matter, this repetition, this running around in a fateful circle? The river laughed.
<p/>Yes, so it was, everything came back, which had not been suffered and solved up to its end, the same pain was suffered over and over again.
<p/>But Siddhartha want back into the boat and ferried back to the hut, thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father, thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son, laughed at by the river, at odds with himself, tending towards despair, and not less tending towards laughing along at himself and the entire world.
<p/>Alas, the wound was not blossoming yet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart was still fighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) fate, cheerfulness and victory were not yet shining from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) suffering.
<p/>Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt hope, and once he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had returned to the hut, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt an undefeatable desire to open up to Vasudeva, to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) everything, the master of listening, to say everything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) no longer used the ferry-boat, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes were starting to get weak, and not just his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes; his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) arms and hands as well.
<p/>Vasudeva was sitting in the hut and weaving a basket. Unchanged and flourishing was only the joy and the cheerful benevolence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) face.
<p/>What they had never talked about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) now told him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) of, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) walk to the city, at that time, of the burning wound, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) envy at the sight of happy fathers, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) knowledge of the foolishness of such wishes, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) futile fight against them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) reported everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was able to say everything, even the most embarrassing parts, everything could be said, everything shown, everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could tell.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) presented his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wound, also told how he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) fled today, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) ferried across the water, a childish run-away, willing to walk to the city, how the river had laughed.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) spoke, spoke for a long time, while Vasudeva was listening with a quiet face, Vasudeva's listening gave Siddhartha a stronger sensation than ever before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) sensed how his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) pain, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) fears flowed over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), how his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) secret hope flowed over, came back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) counterpart.
<p/>To show his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wound to this listener was the same as bathing it in the river, until it had cooled and become one with the river.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was still speaking, still admitting and confessing, Siddhartha felt more and more that this was no longer Vasudeva, no longer a human being, who was listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), that this motionless listener was absorbing his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) confession into himself like a tree the rain, that this motionless man was the river itself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was God himself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the eternal itself.
<p/>And while Siddhartha stopped thinking of himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wound, this realisation of Vasudeva's changed character took possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt it and entered into it, the less wondrous it became, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) realised that everything was in order and natural, that Vasudeva had already been like this for a long time, almost forever, that only he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had not quite recognised it, yes, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) himself had almost reached the same state.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) felt, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was now seeing old Vasudeva as the people see the gods, and that this could not last; in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) started bidding his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) farewell to Vasudeva.
<p/>Siddhartha sat down next to the old man, slowly he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) started talking. Throughout all this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) talked incessantly. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had finished talking, Vasudeva turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) friendly eyes, which had grown slightly weak, at him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)
<p/>, said nothing, let his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) silent love and cheerfulness, understanding and knowledge, shine at him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) took Siddhartha's hand, led him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) to the seat by the bank, sat down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), smiled at the river.
<p/>'' You've heard it laugh,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) said. '' But you haven't heard everything. Let's listen, you'll hear more. '' They listened.
<p/>Siddhartha looked into the water, and images appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) in the moving water: his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father appeared, lonely, mourning for his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son; he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) himself appeared, lonely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) also being tied with the bondage of yearning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) distant son; his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son appeared, lonely as well, the boy, greedily rushing along the burning course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) young wishes, each one heading for his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) goal, each one obsessed by the goal, each one suffering.
<p/>The river sang with a voice of suffering, longingly it sang, longingly, it flowed towards its goal, lamentingly its voice sang.
<p/>Softly sounded the river, singing in many voices. '' Do you hear? '' Vasudeva's mute gaze asked. Siddhartha nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Listen better!''
 (<font color='red'><b>father image image</b></font>)</div><p/>The image of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) father, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) own image, the image of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) son merged, Kamala's image also appeared and was dispersed, and the image of Govinda, and other images, and they merged with each other, turned all into the river, headed all, being the river, for the goal, longing, desiring, suffering, and the river's voice sounded full of yearning, full of burning woe, full of unsatisfiable desire.
<p/>For the goal, the river was heading, Siddhartha saw it hurrying, the river, which consisted of him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) loved ones and of all people, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had ever seen, all of these waves and waters were hurrying, suffering, towards goals, many goals, the waterfall, the lake, the rapids, the sea, and all goals were reached, and every goal was followed by a new one, and the water turned into vapour and rose to the sky, turned into rain and poured down from the sky, turned into a source, a stream, a river, headed forward once again, flowed on once again.
<p/>It still resounded, full of suffering, searching, but other voices joined it, voices of joy and of suffering, good and bad voices, laughing and sad ones, a hundred voices, a thousand voices.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was now nothing but a listener, completely concentrated on listening, completely empty, he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) felt, that he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had now finished learning to listen.
<p/>Vasudeva whispered. Siddhartha made an effort to listen better. But the longing voice had changed. Siddhartha listened. Often before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had heard all this, these many voices in the river, today it sounded new.
<p/>Already, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) could no longer tell the many voices apart, not the happy ones from the weeping ones, not the ones of children from those of men, they all belonged together, the lamentation of yearning and the laughter of the knowledgeable one, the scream of rage and the moaning of the dying ones, everything was one, everything was intertwined and connected, entangled a thousand times.
<p/>And everything together, all voices, all goals, all yearning, all suffering, all pleasure, all that was good and evil, all of this together was the world.
<p/>And when Siddhartha was listening attentively to this river, this song of a thousand voices, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) neither listened to the suffering nor the laughter, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) did not tie his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) soul to any particular voice and submerged his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) self into it, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) heard them all, perceived the whole, the oneness, then the great song of the thousand voices consisted of a single word, which was Om: the perfection.
<p/>All of it together was the flow of events, was the music of life. '' Do you hear,'' Vasudeva's gaze asked again.
<p/>Brightly, Vasudeva's smile was shining, floating radiantly over all the wrinkles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) old face, as the Om was floating in the air over all the voices of the river.
<p/>Brightly his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) smile was shining, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) friend, and brightly the same smile was now starting to shine on Siddhartha's face as well.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) wound blossomed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) suffering was shining, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) self had flown into the oneness. In this hour, Siddhartha stopped fighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) fate, stopped suffering.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) face flourished the cheerfulness of a knowledge, which is no longer opposed by any will, which knows perfection, which is in agreement with the flow of events, with the current of life, full of sympathy for the pain of others, full of sympathy for the pleasure of others, devoted to the flow, belonging to the oneness.
<p/>When Vasudeva rose from the seat by the bank, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) looked into Siddhartha's eyes and saw the cheerfulness of the knowledge shining in them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) softly touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) shoulder with his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hand, in this careful and tender manner, and said: <div class="bookquote">``I've been waiting for this hour, my dear.
<p/>Now that it has come, let me leave. For a long time, I've been waiting for this hour; for a long time, I've been Vasudeva the ferryman.
<p/>Now it's enough. Farewell, hut, farewell, river, farewell, Siddhartha! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha made a deep bow before him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) who bid his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) farewell.
<p/>'' I've known it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) said quietly. '' You'll go into the forests?'' '' I'm going into the forests, I'm going into the oneness,'' spoke Vasudeva with a bright smile.
<p/>With deep joy, with deep solemnity he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) leave, saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) steps full of peace, saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) head full of lustre, saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) body full of light.
<p/>GOVINDA Together with other monks, Govinda used to spend the time of rest between pilgrimages in the pleasure-grove, which the courtesan Kamala had given to the followers of Gotama for a gift.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) heard talk of an old ferryman, who lived one day's journey away by the river, and who was regarded as a wise man by many.
<p/>With a bright smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left; Siddhartha watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) leaving. When Govinda went back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) chose the path to the ferry, eager to see the ferryman.
<p/>Because, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had lived his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) entire life by the rules, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) was also looked upon with veneration by the younger monks on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) age and his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) modesty, the restlessness and the searching still had not perished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) came to the river and asked the old man to ferry him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) over, and when they got off the boat on the other side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) said to the old man: <div class="bookquote">``You're very good to us monks and pilgrims, you have already ferried many of us across the river.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Quoth Siddhartha, smiling from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) old eyes: <div class="bookquote">``Do you call yourself a searcher, oh venerable one, though you are already of an old in years and are wearing the robe of Gotama's monks?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div><p/>Aren't you too, ferryman, a searcher for the right path? '' It's true, I'm old,'' spoke Govinda, <div class="bookquote">``but I haven't stopped searching.
<p/>Never I'll stop searching, this seems to be my destiny. You too, so it seems to me, have been searching. Would you like to tell me something, oh honourable one?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>Quoth Siddhartha: <div class="bookquote">``What should I possibly have to tell you, oh venerable one? Perhaps that you're searching far too much?
<p/>When someone is searching,''  (<font color='red'><b>Quoth Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>said Siddhartha, <div class="bookquote">``then it might easily happen that the only thing his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes still see is that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) searches for, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is unable to find anything, to let anything enter his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) mind, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) always thinks of nothing but the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) search, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) has a goal, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) is obsessed by the goal.
<p/>That in all that searching, you don't find the time for finding?''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How come? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>asked Govinda. '' Searching means: having a goal.
<p/>You, oh venerable one, are perhaps indeed a searcher, because, striving for your goal, there are many things you don't see, which are directly in front of your eyes.
<p/>But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't quite understand yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>asked Govinda, ``what do you mean by this?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A long time ago, oh venerable one, many years ago, you've once before been at this river and have found a sleeping man by the river, and have sat down with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to guard his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleep.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Quoth Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Quoth Siddhartha: But, oh Govinda, you did not recognise the sleeping man. '' Astonished, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had been the object of a magic spell, the monk looked into the ferryman's eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you Siddhartha? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) asked with a timid voice. '' I wouldn't have recognised you this time as well! From my heart, I'm greeting you, Siddhartha; from my heart, I'm happy to see you once again!
<p/>You've changed a lot, my friend.--And so you've now become a ferryman?'' In a friendly manner, Siddhartha laughed. '' A ferryman, yes.
<p/>Many people, Govinda, have to change a lot, have to wear many a robe, I am one of those, my dear.
<p/>Be welcome, Govinda, and spend the night in my hut.'' Govinda stayed the night in the hut and slept on the bed which used to be Vasudeva's bed.
<p/>When in the next morning the time had come to start the day's journey, Govinda said, not without hesitation, these words: <div class="bookquote">``Before I'll continue on my path, Siddhartha, permit me to ask one more question.
<p/>Many questions he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) posed to the friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) youth, many things Siddhartha had to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) life. Do you have a teaching?
<p/>Do you have a faith, or a knowledge, you follow, which helps you to live and to do right? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>Quoth Siddhartha: <div class="bookquote">``You know, my dear, that
<p/>I already as a young man, in those days when we lived with the penitents in the forest, started to distrust teachers and teachings and to turn my back to them.
<p/>A beautiful courtesan has been my teacher for a long time, and a rich merchant was my teacher, and some gamblers with dice.
<p/>Once, even a follower of Buddha, travelling on foot, has been my teacher; he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) sat with me when I had fallen asleep in the forest, on the pilgrimage.
<p/>I have stuck with this. Nevertheless, I have had many teachers since then. I've also learned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>), I'm also grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>), very grateful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) was a very simple person, Vasudeva, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) was no thinker, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) knew what is necessary just as well as Gotama
<p/>But most of all, I have learned here from this river and from my predecessor, the ferryman Vasudeva. , he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) was a perfect man, a saint.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Quoth Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Govinda said: <div class="bookquote">``Still, oh Siddhartha, you love a bit to mock people, as it seems to me. I believe in you and know that you haven't followed a teacher.
<p/>But haven't you found something by yourself, though you've found no teachings, you still found certain thoughts, certain insights, which are your own and which help you to live?
<p/>If you would like to tell me some of these, you would delight my heart. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>Quoth Siddhartha: <div class="bookquote">``I've had thoughts, yes, and insight, again and again.
<p/>Sometimes, for an hour or for an entire day, I have felt knowledge in me, as one would feel life in one's heart.
<p/>There have been many thoughts, but it would be hard for me to convey them to you. Look, my dear Govinda, this is one of my thoughts, which I have found: wisdom cannot be passed on.
<p/>Wisdom which a wise man tries to pass on to someone always sounds like foolishness.''  (<font color='red'><b>Quoth Siddhartha insight</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you kidding?''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>asked Govinda. ''
<p/>It can be found, it can be lived, it is possible to be carried by it, miracles can be performed with it, but it cannot be expressed in words and taught.
<p/>I'm not kidding. I'm telling you what I've found. Knowledge can be conveyed, but not wisdom. This was what I, even as a young man, sometimes suspected, what has driven me away from the teachers.
<p/>I have found a thought, Govinda, which you'll again regard as a joke or foolishness, but which is my best thought.
<p/>It says: The opposite of every truth is just as true! That's like this: any truth can only be expressed and put into words when it is one-sided.
<p/>Everything is one-sided which can be thought with thoughts and said with words, it's all one-sided, all just one half, all lacks completeness, roundness, oneness.
<p/>When the exalted Gotama spoke in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) teachings of the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had to divide it into Sansara and Nirvana, into deception and truth, into suffering and salvation.
<p/>It cannot be done differently, there is no other way for him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) who wants to teach. But the world itself, what exists around us and inside of us, is never one-sided.
<p/>A person or an act is never entirely Sansara or entirely Nirvana, a person is never entirely holy or entirely sinful.
<p/>It does really seem like this, because we are subject to deception, as if time was something real. Time is not real, Govinda, I have experienced this often and often again.
<p/>And if time is not real, then the gap which seems to be between the world and the eternity, between suffering and blissfulness, between evil and good, is also a deception.
<p/>The sinner, which I am and which you are, is a sinner, but in times to come he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) will be Brahma again, he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) will reach the Nirvana, will be Buddha--and now see: these `times to come' are a deception, are only a parable!
<p/>The sinner is not on his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) way to become a Buddha, he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) is not in the process of developing, though our capacity for thinking does not know how else to picture these things.
<p/>No, within the sinner is now and today already the future Buddha, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) future is already all there, you have to worship in him (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>), in you, in everyone the Buddha which is coming into being, the possible, the hidden Buddha.
<p/>The world, my friend Govinda, is not imperfect, or on a slow path towards perfection: no, it is perfect in every moment, all sin already carries the divine forgiveness in itself, all small children already have the old person in themselves, all infants already have death, all dying people the eternal life.
<p/>It is not possible for any person to see how far another one has already progressed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) path; in the robber and dice-gambler, the Buddha is waiting; in the Brahman, the robber is waiting.
<p/>In deep meditation, there is the possibility to put time out of existence, to see all life which was, is, and will be as if it was simultaneous, and there everything is good, everything is perfect, everything is Brahman.
<p/>Therefore, I see whatever exists as good, death is to me like life, sin like holiness, wisdom like foolishness, everything has to be as it is, everything only requires my consent, only my willingness, my loving agreement, to be good for me, to do nothing but work for my benefit, to be unable to ever harm me.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>asked Govinda timidly. '' Listen well, my dear, listen well! I have experienced on my body and on my soul that I needed sin very much
<p/>, I needed lust, the desire for possessions, vanity, and needed the most shameful despair, in order to learn how to give up all resistance, in order to learn how to love the world, in order to stop comparing it to some world I wished, I imagined, some kind of perfection I had made up, but to leave it as it is and to love it and to enjoy being a part of it.--These, oh Govinda, are some of the thoughts which have come into my mind.''
<p/>This here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) said playing with it, <div class="bookquote">``is a stone, and will, after a certain time, perhaps turn into soil, and will turn from soil into a plant or animal or human being.
<p/>In the past, I would have said: This stone is just a stone, it is worthless, it belongs to the world of the Maja; but because it might be able to become also a human being and a spirit in the cycle of transformations, therefore I also grant it importance.
<p/>Siddhartha bent down, picked up a stone from the ground, and weighed it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) hand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Thus, I would perhaps have thought in the past.
<p/>But today I think: this stone is a stone, it is also animal, it is also god, it is also Buddha, I do not venerate and love it because it could turn into this or that, but rather because it is already and always everything-- and
<p/>it is this very fact, that it is a stone, that it appears to me now and today as a stone, this is why I love it and see worth and purpose in each of its veins and cavities, in the yellow, in the gray, in the hardness, in the sound it makes when I knock at it, in the dryness or wetness of its surface.
<p/>There are stones which feel like oil or soap, and others like leaves, others like sand, and every one is special and prays the Om in its own way, each one is Brahman, but simultaneously and just as much it is a stone, is oily or juicy, and
<p/>this is this very fact which I like and regard as wonderful and worthy of worship.--But let me speak no more of this.
<p/>The words are not good for the secret meaning, everything always becomes a bit different, as soon as it is put into words, gets distorted a bit, a bit silly--yes, and this is also very good, and I like it a lot, I also very much agree with this, that this
<p/>what is one man's treasure and wisdom always sounds like foolishness to another person. '' Govinda listened silently. '' Why have you told me this about the stone?
<p/>Or perhaps what I meant was, that love this very stone, and the river, and all these things we are looking at and from which we can learn.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) asked hesitantly after a pause. '' I did it without any specific intention. I can love a stone, Govinda, and also a tree or a piece of bark.
<p/>Therefore, teachings are no good for me, they have no hardness, no softness, no colours, no edges, no smell, no taste, they have nothing but words.
<p/>This are things, and things can be loved. But I cannot love words. Perhaps it are these which keep you from finding peace, perhaps it are the many words.
<p/>Because salvation and virtue as well, Sansara and Nirvana as well, are mere words, Govinda. There is no thing which would be Nirvana; there is just the word Nirvana.
<p/>'' Quoth Govinda: <div class="bookquote">``Not just a word, my friend, is Nirvana. It is a thought. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha continued: <div class="bookquote">``A thought, it might be so.
<p/>I must confess to you, my dear : I don't differentiate much between thoughts and words. To be honest, I also have no high opinion of thoughts.
<p/>Here on this ferry-boat, for instance, a man has been my predecessor and teacher, a holy man, who has for many years simply believed in the river, nothing else.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had noticed that the river's spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learned from it, it educated and taught him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), the river seemed to be a god to him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), for many years he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) did not know that every wind, every cloud, every bird, every beetle was just as divine and knows just as much and can teach just as much as the worshipped river.
<p/>But when this holy man went into the forests, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew everything, knew more than you and me, without teachers, without books, only because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had believed in the river.
<p/>I have a better opinion of things. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>Govinda said: <div class="bookquote">``But is that what you call `things', actually something real, something which has existence?
<p/>Isn't it just a deception of the Maja, just an image and illusion? Your stone, your tree, your river-- are they actually a reality?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div><p/>Let the things be illusions or not, after all I would then also be an illusion, and thus they are always like me.
<p/>'' This too,'' spoke Siddhartha, <div class="bookquote">``I do not care very much about. This is what makes them so dear and worthy of veneration for me: they are like me.
<p/>And this is now a teaching you will laugh about: love, oh Govinda, seems to me to be the most important thing of all.
<p/>Therefore, I can love them. To thoroughly understand the world, to explain it, to despise it, may be the thing great thinkers do.
<p/>But I'm only interested in being able to love the world, not to despise it, not to hate it and me, to be able to look upon it and me and all beings with love and admiration and great respect.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div><p/>'' This I understand,'' spoke Govinda. '' But this very thing was discovered by the exalted one to be a deception.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) commands benevolence, clemency, sympathy, tolerance, but not love; he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) forbade us to tie our heart in love to earthly things.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>)</div>said Siddhartha; his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) smile shone golden. '' I know it, Govinda. And behold, with this we are right in the middle of the thicket of opinions, in the dispute about words.
<p/>For I cannot deny, my words of love are in a contradiction, a seeming contradiction with Gotama's words. For this very reason, I distrust in words so much, for I know
<p/>How should he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) not know love, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), who has discovered all elements of human existence in their transitoriness, in their meaninglessness, and yet loved people thus much, to use a long, laborious life only to help them, to teach them!
<p/>Even with him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>), even with your great teacher, I prefer the thing over the words, place more importance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) acts and life than on his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) speeches, more on the gestures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) hand than his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) opinions.
<p/>, this contradiction is a deception. I know that I am in agreement with Gotama. Not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) speech, not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) thoughts, I see his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) greatness, only in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) actions, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) life.
<p/>'' For a long time, the two old men said nothing. Then spoke Govinda, while bowing for a farewell: <div class="bookquote">``I thank you, Siddhartha, for telling me some of your thoughts.
<p/>They are partially strange thoughts, not all have been instantly understandable to me. This being as it may, I thank you, and I wish you to have calm days.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Govinda</b></font>)</div>-LRB-But secretly he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thought to himself: This Siddhartha is a bizarre person, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) expresses bizarre thoughts, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) teachings sound foolish.
<p/>So differently sound the exalted one's pure teachings, clearer, purer, more comprehensible, nothing strange, foolish, or silly is contained in them.
<p/>But different from his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) thoughts seemed to me Siddhartha's hands and feet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) forehead, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) breath, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) smile, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) greeting, his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) walk.
<p/>Never again, after our exalted Gotama has become one with the Nirvana, never since then have I met a person of whom I felt: this is a holy man!
<p/>May his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teachings be strange, may his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words sound foolish; out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gaze and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skin and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair, out of every part of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shines a purity, shines a calmness, shines a cheerfulness and mildness and holiness, which I have seen in no other person since the final death of our exalted teacher.-RRB-
<p/>As Govinda thought like this, and there was a conflict in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) once again bowed to Siddhartha, drawn by love.
<p/>Only him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), this Siddhartha, I have found to be like this. Deeply he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) bowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) who was calmly sitting. ''
<p/>Siddhartha,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">``we have become old men. It is unlikely for one of us to see the other again in this incarnation.
<p/>Tell me, oh honourable one, one more word, give me something on my way which I can grasp, which I can understand!
<p/>I see, beloved, that you have found peace. I confess that I haven't found it. Give me something to be with me on my path.
<p/>It is often hard, my path, often dark, Siddhartha.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Siddhartha said nothing and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) with the ever unchanged, quiet smile.
<p/>Govinda stared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) face, with fear, with yearning, suffering, and the eternal search was visible in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) look, eternal not-finding.
<p/>Siddhartha saw it and smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Bend down to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) whispered quietly in Govinda's ear. ``Bend down to me! Like this, even closer!
<p/>But while Govinda with astonishment, and yet drawn by great love and expectation, obeyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) words, bent down closely to him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) and touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) lips, something miraculous happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>).
<p/>While his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) thoughts were still dwelling on Siddhartha's wondrous words, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) was still struggling in vain and with reluctance to think away time, to imagine Nirvana and Sansara as one, while even a certain contempt for the words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) friend was fighting in him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) against an immense love and veneration, this happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>):
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) no longer saw the face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) friend Siddhartha, instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw other faces, many, a long sequence, a flowing river of faces, of hundreds, of thousands, which all came and disappeared, and yet all seemed to be there simultaneously, which all constantly changed and renewed themselves, and which were still all Siddhartha.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw the face of a fish, a carp, with an infinitely painfully opened mouth, the face of a dying fish, with fading eyes--he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw the face of a new-born child, red and full of wrinkles, distorted from crying--he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw the face of a murderer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) plunging a knife into the body of another person--he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw, in the same second, this criminal in bondage, kneeling and his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) head being chopped off by the executioner with one blow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) sword--he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw the bodies of men and women, naked in positions and cramps of frenzied love--he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw corpses stretched out, motionless, cold, void-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw the heads of animals, of boars, of crocodiles, of elephants, of bulls, of birds--he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw gods, saw Krishna, saw Agni--he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) saw all of these figures and faces in a thousand relationships with one another, each one helping the other, loving it, hating it, destroying it, giving re-birth to it, each one was a will to die, a passionately painful confession of transitoriness, and yet none of them died, each one only transformed, was always re-born, received evermore a new face, without any time having passed between the one and the other face--and all of these figures and faces rested, flowed, generated themselves, floated along and merged with each other, and they were all constantly covered by something thin, without individuality of its own, but yet existing, like a thin glass or ice, like a transparent skin, a shell or mold or mask of water, and this mask was smiling, and this mask was Siddhartha's smiling face, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>), Govinda, in this very same moment touched with his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) lips.
<p/>And, Govinda saw it like this, this smile of the mask, this smile of oneness above the flowing forms, this smile of simultaneousness above the thousand births and deaths, this smile of Siddhartha was precisely the same, was precisely of the same kind as the quiet, delicate, impenetrable, perhaps benevolent, perhaps mocking, wise, thousand-fold smile of Gotama, the Buddha, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Buddha</b></font>) had seen it himself with great respect a hundred times.
<p/>Not knowing any more whether time existed, whether the vision had lasted a second or a hundred years, not knowing any more whether there existed a Siddhartha, a Gotama, a me and a you, feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) innermost self as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had been wounded by a divine arrow, the injury of which tasted sweet, being enchanted and dissolved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) innermost self, Govinda still stood for a little while bent over Siddhartha's quiet face, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) had just kissed, which had just been the scene of all manifestations, all transformations, all existence.
<p/>The face was unchanged, after under its surface the depth of the thousandfoldness had closed up again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) smiled silently, smiled quietly and softly, perhaps very benevolently, perhaps very mockingly, precisely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Siddhartha</b></font>) used to smile, the exalted one.
<p/>Deeply, Govinda bowed; tears he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) knew nothing of, ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) old face; like a fire burnt the feeling of the most intimate love, the humblest veneration in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Deeply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) bowed, touching the ground, before him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) who was sitting motionlessly, whose smile reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) of everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) had ever loved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) life, what had ever been valuable and holy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Govinda</b></font>) life.
