<p/>OR PIN-MONEY LII FAGIN'S LAST NIGHT ALIVE LIII AND LAST CHAPTER I TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS (<font color='blue'><b>FAGIN</b></font>) BIRTH
<p/>Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter.
<p/>For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country.
<p/>Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred.
<p/>The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,--a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.
<p/>Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time.
<p/>There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them.
<p/>The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter.
<p/>As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, <div class="bookquote">`Let me see the child, and die.'
 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The surgeon had been sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) hands a warm and a rub alternately.
<p/>As the young woman spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) rose, and advancing to the bed's head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">`Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Lor bless her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dear heart, no!'  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has lived as long as I have, sir, and had thirteen children of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own, and all on 'em dead except two, and them in the wurkus with me, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll know better than to take on in that way, bless her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dear heart!
<p/>Lor bless her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dear heart, Think what it is to be a mother, there's a dear young lamb do.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother's prospects failed in producing its due effect.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) imprinted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cold white lips passionately on its forehead; passed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face; gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back--and died.
<p/>The patient shook her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head, and stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand towards the child. The surgeon deposited it in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms. They chafed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever.
<p/>They talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long. <div class="bookquote">` It's all over, Mrs. Thingummy!'  (<font color='red'><b>strangers</b></font>)</div>said the surgeon at last. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ah, poor dear, so it is!'  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>said the nurse, picking up the cork of the green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) stooped to take up the child. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`You needn't mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,'  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>said the surgeon, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) gloves with great deliberation. `
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) way to the door, added, <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was a good-looking girl, too; where did she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) come from?'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Poor dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>It's very likely it will be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.' She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was brought here last night,' replied the old woman, <div class="bookquote">`by the overseer's order.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had walked some distance, for her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) shoes were worn to pieces; but where she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) came from, or where she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was going to, nobody knows.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was found lying in the street. The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand. <div class="bookquote">` The old story,'  (<font color='red'><b>The surgeon</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) head: <div class="bookquote">`no wedding-ring, I see.
<p/>The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.
<p/>Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) only covering, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) proper station in society.
<p/>But now that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was badged and ticketed, and fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) place at once--a parish child--the orphan of a workhouse--the humble, half-starved drudge--to be cuffed and buffeted through the world--despised by all, and pitied by none.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>drudge</b></font>) could have known that he (<font color='blue'><b>drudge</b></font>) was an orphan, left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>drudge</b></font>) would have cried the louder.
<p/>Ah! Good-night!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was! Oliver cried lustily. CHAPTER II TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD
<p/>For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was brought up by hand.
<p/>The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in <div class="bookquote">`the house'  (<font color='red'><b>the workhouse authorities</b></font>)</div>who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) stood in need.
<p/>The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not.
<p/>Upon this, the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be <div class="bookquote">`farmed,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>or, in other words, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off,
<p/>where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.
<p/>Sevenpence-halfpenny's worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable.
<p/>The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) knew what was good for children; and she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself.
<p/>So, she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them.
<p/>Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) had not died, four-and-twenty hours before he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) was to have had his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) first comfortable bait of air.
<p/>Unfortunately for, the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) system; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this.
<p/>Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead, or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing--though the latter accident was very scarce, anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm--the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance.
<p/>But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside -LRB-which was very probable indeed-RRB-, and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional.
<p/>Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were going.
<p/>Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher. The children were neat and clean to behold, when they went; and what more would the people have!
<p/>It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist's ninth birthday found him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and decidedly small in circumference.
<p/>It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) having any ninth birth-day at all.
<p/>Be this as it may, however, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) ninth birthday; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann, thrusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy. `
<p/>But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver's breast. Goodness gracious! -LRB-Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash 'em directly.-RRB---My heart alive!
<p/>Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) gave the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle's. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you, sure-ly!'  (<font color='red'><b>a beadle</b></font>)</div>Lor, only think,' said Mrs. Mann, running out,--for the three boys had been removed by this time,--`only think of that!
<p/>That I should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them dear children! Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.'
<p/>Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the beadle. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Bumble, grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane, <div class="bookquote">`to keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans?
<p/>I'm sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Mann with great humility.
<p/>Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?' ` Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) oratorical powers and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) importance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had displayed the one, and vindicated the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) relaxed. <div class="bookquote">` Well, well, Mrs. Mann,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) replied in a calmer tone; <div class="bookquote">`it may be as you say; it may be.
<p/>Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor; placed a seat for him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>); and officiously deposited his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) cocked hat and cane on the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>).
<p/>Mr. Bumble wiped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) forehead the perspiration which his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the cocked hat, and smiled.
<p/>Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and have something to say.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) smiled. Beadles are but men: and Mr. Bumble smiled. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now don't you be offended at what I'm a going to say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Mann, with captivating sweetness. <div class="bookquote">` You've had a long walk, you know, or I wouldn't mention it.
<p/>Now, will you take a little drop of somethink, Mr. Bumble?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not a drop. Nor a drop,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) right hand in a dignified, but placid manner. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I think you will,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Just a leetle drop, with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bumble coughed. <div class="bookquote">` Now, just a leetle drop,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann persuasively. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, it's what I'm obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put into the blessed infants'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>Daffy, when they ain't well, Mr. Bumble,' replied Mrs. Mann as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and glass. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>inquired the beadle. <div class="bookquote">` It's gin. I'll not deceive you, Mr. B. It's gin.'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Do you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired Bumble, following with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes the interesting process of mixing. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ah, bless 'em, that I do, dear as it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied the nurse. <div class="bookquote">` I couldn't see 'em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; <div class="bookquote">`no, you could not. You are a humane woman, Mrs. Mann.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) set down the glass.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.'

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) stirred the gin-and-water.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">` I--I drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) swallowed half of it. <div class="bookquote">` And now about business,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, taking out a leathern pocket-book. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine year old to-day.'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Bless him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) left eye with the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) apron. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Notwithstanding the most superlative, and, I may say, supernat`ral exertions on the part of this parish,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Bumble, <div class="bookquote">`we have never been able to discover who is his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) father, or what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mother's settlement, name, or condition.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Mann raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment's reflection, <div class="bookquote">`How comes he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) to have any name at all, then?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div><p/>And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was afterwards increased to twenty pound. The beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, <div class="bookquote">`I inwented it.'  (<font color='red'><b>The beadle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You, Mr. Bumble!'  (<font color='red'><b>The beadle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I, Mrs. Mann. We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The last was a S,--Swubble, I named him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).
<p/>I have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it again, when we come to Z.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This was a T,--Twist, I named him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) . The next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins. Why, you're quite a literary character, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann. `
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) finished the gin-and-water, and added, <div class="bookquote">`Oliver being now too old to remain here, the board have determined to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) back into the house.
<p/>Well, well,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment; <div class="bookquote">`perhaps I may be. Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>I have come out myself to take him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) there.
<p/>Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed off in one washing, was led into the room by his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) benevolent protectress. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So let me see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) at once.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I'll fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) directly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that purpose. Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,' said Mrs. Mann.
<p/>Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair, and the cocked hat on the table. `
<p/>Oliver was about to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would go along with anybody with great readiness, when, glancing upward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had got behind the beadle's chair, and was shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) fist at him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) with a furious countenance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) took the hint at once, for the fist had been too often impressed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) body not to be deeply impressed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) recollection. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Will you go along with me, Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic voice. Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) go with me?' inquired poor Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) can't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>)'ll come and see you sometimes.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>This was no very great consolation to the child.
<p/>Young as he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) was, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away. It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Mrs. Mann gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece of bread and butter, less he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should seem too hungry when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) got to the workhouse.
<p/>With the slice of bread in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand, and the little brown-cloth parish cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head, Oliver was then led away by Mr. Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) infant years.
<p/>Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you want to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) burst into an agony of childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>Wretched as were the little companions in misery he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was leaving behind, they were the only friends he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever known; and a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) loneliness in the great wide world, sank into the child's heart for the first time.
<p/>Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were <div class="bookquote">`nearly there.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>To these interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was once again a beadle.
<p/>Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) over to the care of an old woman, returned; and, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) it was a board night, informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) that the board had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was to appear before it forthwith.
<p/>Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was, Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite certain whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ought to laugh or cry.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had no time to think about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) a tap on the head, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane, to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) up: and another on the back to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lively: and bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) to follow, conducted him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) into a large white-washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table.
<p/>At the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face. `
<p/>Oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes; and seeing no board but the table, fortunately bowed to that. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) tremble: and the beadle gave him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) another tap behind, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) cry.
<p/>These two causes made him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) answer in a very low and hesitating voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a fool.
<p/>Bow to the board,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Bumble. What's your name, boy? ` said the gentleman in the high chair. Which was a capital way of raising his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spirits, and putting him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) quite at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ease. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Boy,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the high chair, <div class="bookquote">`listen to me. You know you're an orphan, I suppose?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What's that, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired poor Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The boy is a fool--I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. <div class="bookquote">` Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman who had spoken first. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You know you've got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, weeping bitterly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What are you crying for?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat. And to be sure it was very extraordinary. What could the boy be crying for? <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I hope you say your prayers every night,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said another gentleman in a gruff voice; <div class="bookquote">`and pray for the people who feed you, and take care of you--like a Christian.'
 (<font color='red'><b>another gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>It would have been very like a Christian, and a marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) .
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>stammered the boy. The gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right. But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hadn't, because nobody had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sobbed himself to sleep.
<p/>Well! So you'll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o'clock,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>added the surly one in the white waistcoat. What a novel illustration of the tender laws of England!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) little thought, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) future fortunes.
<p/>And this was it: The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out at once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered--the poor people liked it!
<p/>It was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oho!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the board, looking very knowing; <div class="bookquote">`we are the fellows to set this to rights; we'll stop it all, in no time.'
 (<font color='red'><b>all people</b></font>)</div><p/>So, they established the rule, that all poor people should have the alternative -LRB-for they would compel nobody, not they-RRB-, of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it.
<p/>With this view, they contracted with the water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and half a roll of Sundays.
<p/>They made a great many other wise and humane regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors' Commons; and, instead of compelling a man to support his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family, as they had theretofore done, took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a bachelor!
<p/>There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under these last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society, if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were long-headed men, and had provided for this difficulty.
<p/>They let the paupers go to sleep! Poor Oliver! But they had. The relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened people.
<p/>It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of the increase in the undertaker's bill, and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their wasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two's gruel.
<p/>For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was in full operation. But the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were in ecstasies.
<p/>The room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at mealtimes.
<p/>Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and no more--except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides.
<p/>The boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this operation -LRB-which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls-RRB-, they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager eyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers most assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon.
<p/>Oliver Twist and his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) age, and hadn't been used to that sort of thing -LRB-for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father had kept a small cook-shop-RRB-, hinted darkly to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) companions, that unless he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had another basin of gruel per diem, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age.
<p/>The bowls never wanted washing. Boys have generally excellent appetites. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to Oliver Twist.
<p/>The master, in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cook's uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); the gruel was served out; and a long grace was said over the short commons.
<p/>The evening arrived; the boys took their places. The gruel disappeared; the boys whispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) next neighbors nudged him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) rose from the table; and advancing to the master, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own temerity: <div class="bookquote">`Please, sir, I want some more.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the master basin spoon</b></font>)</div><p/>Child as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was desperate with hunger, and reckless with misery. The master was a fat, healthy man; but he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) turned very pale.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then clung for support to the copper. The assistants were paralysed with wonder; the boys with fear. `
<p/>The master aimed a blow at Oliver's head with the ladle; pinioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.
<p/>The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high chair, said, <div class="bookquote">`Mr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir!
<p/>What!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the master at length, in a faint voice. <div class="bookquote">` Please, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, <div class="bookquote">`I want some more.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Oliver Twist has asked for more!'
<p/>There was a general start. Horror was depicted on every countenance. <div class="bookquote">` For more !'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Limbkins. <div class="bookquote">` Compose yourself, Bumble, and answer me distinctly.
<p/>Do I understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Limbkins</b></font>) asked for more, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Limbkins</b></font>) had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Limbkins</b></font>) did, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That boy will be hung,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. <div class="bookquote">` I know that boy will be hung.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman's opinion.
<p/>Oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the hands of the parish.
<p/>In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade, business, or calling. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I never was more convinced of anything in my life,'  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning: <div class="bookquote">`I never was more convinced of anything in my life, than I am that that boy will come to be hung.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative -LRB-supposing it to possess any at all-RRB-, if I ventured to hint just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination or no.
<p/>An animated discussion took place. CHAPTER III RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
<p/>For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board.
<p/>It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would have established that sage individual's prophetic character, once and for ever, by tying one end of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the wall, and attaching himself to the other.
<p/>To the performance of this feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) only cried bitterly all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) little hands before his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<p/>Let it not be supposed by the enemies of <div class="bookquote">`the system,'  (<font color='red'><b>the enemies</b></font>)</div>that, during the period of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious consolation.
<p/>As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was allowed to perform his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ablutions every morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) catching cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) frame, by repeated applications of the cane.
<p/>As for society, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example.
<p/>And so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself.
<p/>It chanced one morning, while Oliver's affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) way down the High Street, deeply cogitating in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent, for which his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) landlord had become rather pressing.
<p/>Mr. Gamfield's most sanguine estimate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount; and, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) was alternately cudgelling his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) brains and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) donkey, when passing the workhouse, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) eyes encountered the bill on the gate. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) jogged onward.
<p/>Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but more particularly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) eyes; and, running after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>), bestowed a blow on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey's.
<p/>Then, catching hold of the bridle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) jaw a sharp wrench, by way of gentle reminder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) own master; and by these means turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) round.
<p/>A SINECURE There was a still greater obstacle in Oliver's youth and childishness. Wo--o!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) then gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) another blow on the head, just to stun him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) came back again.
<p/>The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board-room.
<p/>Having witnessed the little dispute between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted.
<p/>Mr. Gamfield smiled, too, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) perused the document; for five pounds was just the sum he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was, well knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing for register stoves.
<p/>So, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) spelt the bill through again, from beginning to end; and then, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) fur cap in token of humility, accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat. `
<p/>Having completed these arrangements, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) walked up to the gate, to read the bill. This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to <div class="bookquote">`prentis,'  (<font color='red'><b>This boy sir</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gamfield. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>`If the parish vould like him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) to learn a right pleasant trade, in a good <div class="bookquote">`spectable chimbley-sweepin'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>bisness,' said Mr. Gamfield, `I wants a <div class="bookquote">`prentis, and I am ready to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>).'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Ay, my man,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a condescending smile. ` <div class="bookquote">`Walk in,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
<p/>Mr. Gamfield having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head, and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had first seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's a nasty trade,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) wish. <div class="bookquote">` Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>said another gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>they lit it in the chimbley to make 'em come down again,'  (<font color='red'><b>another gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Gamfield; <div class="bookquote">`that's all smoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain't o'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only sinds him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to sleep, and that's wot he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) likes.
<p/>Boys is wery obstinit, and wery lazy, Gen`l'men, and there's nothink like a good hot blaze to make 'em come down vith a run.
<p/>It's humane too, gen`l'men, acause, even if they've stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet makes 'em struggle to hextricate theirselves.'
<p/>The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation; but his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins.
<p/>The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words <div class="bookquote">`saving of expenditure,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`looked well in the accounts,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`have a printed report published,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were alone audible.
<p/>That's acause they damped the straw afore These only chanced to be heard, indeed, or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis.
<p/>At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said: <div class="bookquote">`We have considered your proposition, and we don't approve of it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not at all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. `
<p/>As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) that the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings.
<p/>It was very unlike their general mode of doing business, if they had; but still, as he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) had no particular wish to revive the rumour, he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) cap in his (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) hands, and walked slowly from the table. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Decidedly not,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added the other members. So you won't let me have him (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>), gen`l'men?' said Mr. Gamfield, pausing near the door. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Limbkins; <div class="bookquote">`at least, as it's a nasty business, we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gamfield's countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) returned to the table, and said, <div class="bookquote">`What'll you give, gen`l'men? Come!
<p/>Don't be too hard on a poor man. What'll you give?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I should say, three pound ten was plenty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Limbkins. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ten shillings too much,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. <div class="bookquote">` Come!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Gamfield; <div class="bookquote">`say four pound, gen`l'men. Say four pound, and you've got rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) for good and all.
<p/>There!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Three pound ten,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly. <div class="bookquote">`Come! I'll split the diff`erence, gen`l'men,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>urged Gamfield. <div class="bookquote">` Three pound fifteen.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Not a farthing more,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins. <div class="bookquote">` You're desperate hard upon me, gen`l'men,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>said Gamfield, wavering. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Pooh! pooh! nonsense!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. ` He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'d be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wants the stick, now and then: it'll do him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) good; and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) board needn't come very expensive, for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hasn't been overfed since he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was born.
<p/>Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and, observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself.
<p/>Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver Twist and his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for signature and approval, that very afternoon.
<p/>In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) excessive astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance, when Mr. Bumble brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) own hands, a basin of gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread.
<p/>At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously: thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) up in that way. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Take him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), you silly fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)'s just the boy for you. Ha! ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>The bargain was made. You're a going to be made a <div class="bookquote">`prentice of, Oliver.'  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>The kind and blessed gentleman which is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are a going to <div class="bookquote">`prentice'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of you: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!--three pound ten,
<p/>A prentice, sir!' said the child, trembling. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` Oliver!--seventy shillins--one hundred and forty sixpences!--and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can't love.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child's face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) sobbed bitterly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Come,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) feelings to observe the effect his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eloquence had produced; <div class="bookquote">`Come, Oliver!
<p/>Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don't cry into your gruel ; that's a very foolish action, Oliver.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the gentleman asked him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wanted to be apprenticed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should like it very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey: the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) failed in either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).
<p/>When they arrived at the office, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was shut up in a little room by himself, and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) came back to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).
<p/>It certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already. There the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour.
<p/>At the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head, unadorned with the cocked hat, and said aloud: <div class="bookquote">`Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mr. Bumble said this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">`Mind what I told you, you young rascal!'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble's face at this somewhat contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) offering any remark thereupon, by leading him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) at once into an adjoining room: the door of which was open.
<p/>Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one of whom was reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with the aid of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of parchment which lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<p/>Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially washed face, on the other; while two or three bluff-looking men, in top-boots, were lounging about.
<p/>The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk. `
<p/>The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head for a moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon, the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It was a large room, with a great window. This is the boy, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. Oh, is this the boy?' said the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This is him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` Bow to the magistrate, my dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>Oliver roused himself, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) best obeisance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been wondering, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes fixed on the magistrates' powder, whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards from thenceforth on that account. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) doats on it, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>the magistrates</b></font>)</div>replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly pinch, to intimate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had better not say he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) didn't. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s fond of chimney-sweeping?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will be a sweep, will he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>inquired the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And this man that's to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master--you, sir--you'll treat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) well, and feed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and do all that sort of thing, will you?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>If we was to bind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to any other trade to-morrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d run away simultaneous, your worship,' replied Bumble. ` said the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You're a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest, open-hearted man,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman: turning his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spectacles in the direction of the candidate for Oliver's premium, whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty.
<p/>But the magistrate was half blind and half childish, so he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) couldn't reasonably be expected to discern what other people did. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>When I says I will, I means I will,'  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly. <div class="bookquote">` I hope I am, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have no doubt you are, my friend,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gamfield/Gamfield</b></font>)</div>replied the old gentleman: fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spectacles more firmly on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nose, and looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for the inkstand.
<p/>If the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would have dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pen into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been straightway hurried off.
<p/>But, as it chanced to be immediately under his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) looked all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) desk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) search to look straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) future master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too palpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate.
<p/>The old gentleman stopped, laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pen, and looked from Oliver to Mr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It was the critical moment of Oliver's fate. My boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`you look pale and alarmed. What is the matter?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stand a little away from him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), Beadle,'  (<font color='red'><b>the magistrate</b></font>)</div>said the other magistrate: laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of interest. `
<p/>Oliver fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knees, and clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands together, prayed that they would order him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) back to the dark room--that they would starve him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)--beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)--kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) if they pleased--rather than send him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) away with that dreadful man. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, boy, tell us what's the matter: don't be afraid.'  (<font color='red'><b>that man</b></font>)</div>Well!' said Mr. Bumble, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hands and eyes with most impressive solemnity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well! of all the artful and designing orphans that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Hold your tongue, Beadle,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the second old gentleman, when Mr. Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I beg your worship's pardon,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having heard aright. <div class="bookquote">` Did your worship speak to me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes. Hold your tongue.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment. A beadle ordered to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) tongue! A moral revolution! The old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) companion, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nodded significantly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I hope,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>stammered Mr. Limbkins: <div class="bookquote">`I hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We refuse to sanction these indentures,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limbkins</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman: tossing aside the piece of parchment as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">` The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the second old gentleman sharply. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would be drawn and quartered into the bargain.
<p/>Mr. Bumble shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head with gloomy mystery, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) might come to good; whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) might come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>); which, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description.
<p/>The next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was again To Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>).
<p/>Take the boy back to the workhouse, and treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) kindly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) seems to want it.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER IV OLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFE
<p/>In great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained, either in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the young man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to sea.
<p/>The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port.
<p/>This suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done with him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>): the probability being, that the skipper would flog him (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) to death, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his (<font color='blue'><b>skipper</b></font>) brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty generally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman of that class.
<p/>The more the case presented itself to the board, in this point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared; so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for Oliver effectually, was to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to sea without delay.
<p/>Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries, with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mission; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) encountered at the gate, no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker.
<p/>Mr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour, and shoes to answer.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) was in general rather given to professional jocosity.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) step was elastic, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) face betokened inward pleasantry, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) advanced to Mr. Bumble, and shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cordially by the hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You'll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box of the undertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I say you'll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker model</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Bumble, tapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) cane. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr. Bumble,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker. <div class="bookquote">` Think so?'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So are the coffins,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle: with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.
<p/>Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) ought to be; and laughed a long time without cessation. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, well, Mr. Bumble,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) said at length, <div class="bookquote">`there's no denying that, since the new system of feeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble.
<p/>The prices allowed by the board are very small, Mr. Bumble.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well-seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron handles come, by canal, from Birmingham.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course, of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>replied the undertaker; `and if I don't get a profit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the long-run, you see--
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Well, well,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, <div class="bookquote">`every trade has its drawbacks. A fair profit is, of course, allowable.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)!'
<p/>Though I must say,' continued the undertaker, resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted: <div class="bookquote">`though I must say, Mr. Bumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage: which is, that all the stout people go off the quickest.
<p/>The people who have been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the first to sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr. Bumble, that three or four inches over one's calculation makes a great hole in one's profits: especially when one has a family to provide for, sir.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an ill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Just so,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. ` Oliver Twist being uppermost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) theme. <div class="bookquote">` By the bye,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, `you don't know anybody who wants a boy, do you?
<p/>A porochial <div class="bookquote">`prentis, who is at present a dead-weight; a millstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat? Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry, liberal terms?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mr. Bumble spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane to the bill above him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), and gave three distinct raps upon the words <div class="bookquote">`five pounds' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>: which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of gigantic size. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Gadso!'  (<font color='red'><b>Roman</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged lappel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) official coat; <div class="bookquote">`that's just the very thing I wanted to speak to you about.
<p/>Yes, I think it rather pretty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) coat. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You know--dear me, what a very elegant button this is, Mr. Bumble! I never noticed it before.'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` The die is the same as the porochial seal--the Good Samaritan healing the sick and bruised man.
<p/>I put it on, I remember, for the first time, to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway at midnight.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The jury brought it in, ``Died from exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life,'' didn't they?'
<p/>The board presented it to me on Newyear's morning, Mr. Sowerberry. <div class="bookquote">` I recollect,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker. ` Mr. Bumble nodded. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And they made it a special verdict, I think,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker, <div class="bookquote">`by adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had--'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Tush! Foolery!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>interposed the beadle. <div class="bookquote">` If the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they'd have enough to do.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/>Juries,' said Mr. Bumble, grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane tightly, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wont when working into a passion: <div class="bookquote">`juries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling wretches.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Very true,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker; <div class="bookquote">`they would indeed.'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">` So they are,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker. <div class="bookquote">` They haven't no more philosophy nor political economy about 'em than that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) fingers contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No more they have,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>acquiesced the undertaker. <div class="bookquote">` I despise 'em,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, growing very red in the face. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And I only wish we'd a jury of the independent sort, in the house for a week or two,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle; <div class="bookquote">`the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for 'em.'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So do I,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>rejoined the undertaker. <div class="bookquote">` Let 'em alone for that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>replied the undertaker. So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) smiled, approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer.
<p/>Mr Bumble lifted off his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown; wiped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) forehead the perspiration which his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) rage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the undertaker, said in a calmer voice: <div class="bookquote">`Well; what about the boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>replied the undertaker; <div class="bookquote">`why, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good deal towards the poor's rates.'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Hem!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>replied the undertaker, <div class="bookquote">`I was thinking that if I pay so much towards 'em, I've a right to get as much out of 'em as I can, Mr. Bumble; and so--
<p/>I think I'll take the boy myself.'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) into the building.
<p/>Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes; and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) that evening <div class="bookquote">`upon liking' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that if the master find, upon a short trial, that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much food into him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) shall have him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) for a term of years, to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) likes with.
<p/>When little Oliver was taken before <div class="bookquote">`the gentlemen'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>that evening; and informed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a coffin-maker's; and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) complained of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) situation, or ever came back to the parish again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would be sent to sea, there to be drowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) evinced so little emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a hardened young rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) forthwith.
<p/>Now, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the world, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they were rather out, in this particular instance.
<p/>The simple fact was, that Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had received.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heard the news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) destination, in perfect silence; and, having had his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) luggage put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand--which was not very difficult to carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep--he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) cap over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble's coat cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.
<p/>For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark; for the beadle carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head very erect, as a beadle always should: and, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of Mr. Bumble's coat as they blew open, and disclosed to great advantage his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches.
<p/>As they drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it expedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) new master: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) accordingly did, with a fit and becoming air of gracious patronage. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oliver!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice. <div class="bookquote">` Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Although Oliver did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was desired, at once; and passed the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) unoccupied hand briskly across his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) left a tear in them when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) looked up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) conductor.
<p/>As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), it rolled down his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cheek. It was followed by another, and another. The child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one.
<p/>Withdrawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) other hand from Mr. Bumble's he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) face with both; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) chin and bony fingers. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) little charge a look of intense malignity. <div class="bookquote">` Well! Of all the ungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are the--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No, no, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the well-known cane; <div class="bookquote">`no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I will, sir!
<p/>I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so--so--'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>` So what? ` inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So lonely, sir! So very lonely!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>cried the child. <div class="bookquote">` Everybody hates me. Oh! sir, don't, don't pray be cross to me!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver's piteous and helpless look, with some astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky manner; and after muttering something about <div class="bookquote">`that troublesome cough,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>bade Oliver dry his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes and be a good boy.
<p/>The child beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heart; and looked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) companion's face, with tears of real agony. Then once more taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) walked on with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in silence.
<p/>The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) shop, was making some entries in his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) day-book by the light of a most appropriate dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Aha!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in the middle of a word; <div class="bookquote">`is that you, Bumble?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` No one else, Mr. Sowerberry,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle. <div class="bookquote">` Here! I've brought the boy.'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>Oliver made a bow. <div class="bookquote">` Oh!
<p/>that's the boy, is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker: raising the candle above his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) head, to get a better view of Oliver. `
<p/>Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and presented the form of a short, then, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish countenance. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mrs. Sowerberry, will you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>My dear,' said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, <div class="bookquote">`this is the boy from the workhouse that I told you of.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) is rather small,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as if it were his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) fault that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was no bigger; `he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) is small.
<p/>Oliver bowed again. <div class="bookquote">` Dear me!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker's wife, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'s very small.'  (<font color='red'><b>undertaker wife</b></font>)</div>There's no denying it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'ll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry--he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'ll grow.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Ah! I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) will,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied the lady pettishly, `on our victuals and our drink. I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they always cost more to keep, than they're worth.
<p/>With this, the undertaker's wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the ante-room to the coal-cellar, and denominated <div class="bookquote">`kitchen' (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>; wherein sat a slatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Here, Charlotte,'  (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down, <div class="bookquote">`give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip.
<p/>However, men always think they know best. There! Get downstairs, little bag o'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>bones.' He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hasn't come home since the morning, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) may go without 'em.
<p/>Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>I wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall within him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected.
<p/>I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine.
<p/>There is only one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Philosopher</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker's wife, when Oliver had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) supper: which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful auguries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) future appetite: <div class="bookquote">`have you done?'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I dare say the boy isn't too dainty to eat 'em--are you, boy?' There being nothing eatable within his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) reach, Oliver replied in the affirmative. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then come with me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty lamp, and leading the way upstairs; <div class="bookquote">`your bed's under the counter.
<p/>You don't mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it doesn't much matter whether you do or don't, for you can't sleep anywhere else.
<p/>Come; don't keep me here all night!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>Oliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) new mistress. CHAPTER V OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES.
<p/>, HE (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) MASTER'S BUSINESS Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker's shop, set the lamp down on a workman's bench, and gazed timidly about him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) with a feeling of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) will be at no loss to understand.
<p/>An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a cold tremble came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), every time his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object: from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mad with terror.
<p/>Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets.
<p/>Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by four black steeds, approaching in the distance.
<p/>GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST TIME The shop was close and hot. The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins.
<p/>The recess beneath the counter in which his (<font color='blue'><b>ghosts</b></font>) flock mattress was thrust, looked like a grave. Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation.
<p/>The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mind; the absence of no loved and well-remembered face sank heavily into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heart.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) wished, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) crept into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) narrow bed, that that were his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) coffin, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the tall grass waving gently above his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sleep.
<p/>Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop-door: which, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could huddle on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) clothes, was repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times.
<p/>The boy had no friends to care for, or to care for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Open the door, will yer?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door. <div class="bookquote">` I will, directly, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning the key. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I suppose yer the new boy, ain't yer?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the voice through the key-hole. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` How old are yer?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired the voice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then I'll whop yer when I get in,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the voice; <div class="bookquote">`you just see if I don't, that's all, my work`us brat!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) might be, would redeem his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) pledge, most honourably.
<p/>Ten, sir,' replied Oliver. ` and having made this obliging promise, the voice began to whistle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) drew back the bolts with a trembling hand, and opened the door.
<p/>For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street, and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm himself; for nobody did he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) cut into wedges, the size of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then consumed with great dexterity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I beg your pardon, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Oliver at length: seeing that no other visitor made his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) appearance; <div class="bookquote">`did you knock?'  (<font color='red'><b>no visitor</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>At this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver would want one before long, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) cut jokes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) superiors in that way. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yer don't know who I am, I suppose, Work`us?'  (<font color='red'><b>superiors</b></font>)</div>said the charity-boy, in continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with edifying gravity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I kicked,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the charity-boy. <div class="bookquote">` Did you want a coffin, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver, innocently. No, sir,' rejoined Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` I'm Mister Noah Claypole,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the charity-boy, `and you're under me.
<p/>With this, Mr. Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a dignified air, which did him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) great credit.
<p/>It is difficult for a large-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls.
<p/>Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) with the assurance that <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)'d catch it,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>condescended to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>).
<p/>Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!' Mr. Sowerberry came down soon after. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry appeared. Oliver having <div class="bookquote">`caught it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>in fulfilment of Noah's prediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Come near the fire, Noah,'  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">` I saved a nice little bit of bacon for you from master's breakfast.
<p/>Oliver, shut that door at Mister Noah's back, and take them bits that I've put out on the cover of the bread-pan.
<p/>There's your tea; take it away to that box, and drink it there, and make haste, for they'll want you to mind the shop.
<p/>D'ye hear?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` D'ye hear, Work`us?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah Claypole. <div class="bookquote">` Lor, Noah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">`what a rum creature you are! Why don't you let the boy alone?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) alone!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Why everybody lets him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) alone enough, for the matter of that. Neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) father nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) mother will ever interfere with him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>).
<p/>All his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) relations let him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) own way pretty well. Eh, Charlotte? He (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh, you queer soul!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>).
<p/>No chance-child was he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) could trace his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) genealogy all the way back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) parents, who lived hard by;
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) mother being a washerwoman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction.
<p/>The shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of <div class="bookquote">`leathers,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`charity,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>and the like; and Noah had bourne them without reply.
<p/>But, now that fortune had cast in his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) retorted on him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) with interest.
<p/>It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity-boy.
<p/>Noah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan. This affords charming food for contemplation. Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker's some three weeks or a month.
<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry--the shop being shut up--were taking their supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after several deferential glances at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) wife, said, <div class="bookquote">`My dear--'
 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up, with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) stopped short. <div class="bookquote">` Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nothing, my dear, nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sowerberry. <div class="bookquote">` Ugh, you brute!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry. <div class="bookquote">` Not at all, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sowerberry humbly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I thought you didn't want to hear, my dear. I was only going to say--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh, don't tell me what you were going to say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>interposed Mrs. Sowerberry. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am nobody; don't consult me, pray. I don't want to intrude upon your secrets.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) gave an hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Sowerberry, <div class="bookquote">`I want to ask your advice.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, no, don't ask mine,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an affecting manner: <div class="bookquote">`ask somebody else's.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, there was another hysterical laugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much. This is a very common and much-approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is often very effective.
<p/>It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as a special favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to hear.
<p/>After a short duration, the permission was most graciously conceded. <div class="bookquote">` It's only about young Twist, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sowerberry. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A very good-looking boy, that, my dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) need be, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) eats enough,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>observed the lady. <div class="bookquote">` There's an expression of melancholy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) face, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>resumed Mr. Sowerberry, <div class="bookquote">`which is very interesting.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) would make a delightful mute, my love.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment. Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for any observation on the good lady's part, proceeded. `
<p/>I don't mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but only for children's practice. It would be very new to have a mute in proportion, my dear.
<p/>Mrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way, was much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been compromising her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) husband's mind before?
<p/>Mr. Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this view, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) should accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) master on the very next occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) services being required.
<p/>Half an hour after breakfast next morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane against the counter, drew forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) large leathern pocket-book: from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) selected a small scrap of paper, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) handed over to Sowerberry. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You may depend upon it, it would have a superb effect.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>The occasion was not long in coming. Aha!' said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance; <div class="bookquote">`an order for a coffin, eh?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`For a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like himself, was very corpulent. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bayton,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` I never heard the name before.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>Bumble shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">`Obstinate people, Mr. Sowerberry; very obstinate.
<p/>Proud, too, I'm afraid, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Proud, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer. <div class="bookquote">` Come, that's too much.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh, it's sickening,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We only heard of the family the night before last,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle; `and we shouldn't have known anything about them, then, only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had gone out to dinner; but his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">`prentice -LRB-which is a very clever lad-RRB- sent 'em some medicine in a blacking-bottle, offhand.'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Antimonial, Mr. Sowerberry!' <div class="bookquote">` So it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>acquiesced the undertaker. ` <div class="bookquote">` Ah, there's promptness,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker. <div class="bookquote">` Promptness, indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, the husband sends back word that the medicine won't suit his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's complaint, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shan't take it--says she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shan't take it, sir!
<p/>Good, strong, wholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish labourers and a coal-heaver, only a week before--sent 'em for nothing, with a blackin' (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>-bottle in,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sends back word that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shan't take it, sir!'
<p/>As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble's mind in full force, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) struck the counter sharply with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane, and became flushed with indignation. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But what's the consequence; what's the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir? Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker, <div class="bookquote">`I ne--ver--did--'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Never did, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>ejaculated the beadle. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No, nor nobody never did; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s dead, we've got to bury her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and that's the direction; and the sooner it's done, the better.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked hat wrong side first, in a fever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was so angry, Oliver, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) forgot even to ask after you!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) strode down the street. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of sight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble's voice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) needn't haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble's glance, however; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided, until such time as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should be firmly bound for seven years, and all danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) hat, <div class="bookquote">`the sooner this job is done, the better. Noah, look after the shop.
<p/>They walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused to look for the house which was the object of their search.
<p/>The houses on either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies half doubled, occasionally skulked along.
<p/>A great many of the tenements had shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering away; only the upper rooms being inhabited.
<p/>Some houses which had become insecure from age and decay, were prevented from falling into the street, by huge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly planted in the road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window, were wrenched from their positions, to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body.
<p/>Oliver, put on your cap, and come with me.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>Oliver obeyed, and followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) master on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) professional mission. The kennel was stagnant and filthy.
<p/>There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) master stopped; so, groping his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) way cautiously through the dark passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs.
<p/>The very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness, were hideous with famine. Stumbling against a door on the landing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) rapped at it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knuckles.
<p/>The undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the apartment to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been directed.
<p/>It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stepped in; Oliver followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>). There was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically, over the empty stove.
<p/>There were some ragged children in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door, there lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket.
<p/>Oliver shuddered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes toward the place, and crept involuntarily closer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) master; for though it was covered up, the boy felt that it was a corpse.
<p/>An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth, and was sitting beside him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). The man's face was thin and very pale; his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hair and beard were grizzly; his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes were bloodshot.
<p/>The old woman's face was wrinkled; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) two remaining teeth protruded over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) under lip; and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes were bright and piercing.
<p/>Oliver was afraid to look at either her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) or the man. They seemed so like the rats he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had seen outside. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nobody shall go near her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the man, starting fiercely up, as the undertaker approached the recess. <div class="bookquote">` Keep back! Damn you, keep back, if you've a life to lose!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>`
<p/><div class="bookquote">`I tell you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man: clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and stamping furiously on the floor,--'I tell you I won't have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put into the ground.
<p/>Nonsense, my good man,' said the undertaker, who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes. <div class="bookquote">` Nonsense!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) couldn't rest there.
<p/>The undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape from his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>The undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees at the feet of the dead woman; <div class="bookquote">`kneel down, kneel down--
<p/>The worms would worry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--not eat her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is so worn away.'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>kneel round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), every one of you, and mark my words!
<p/>I never knew how bad she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was, till the fever came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and then her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bones were starting through the skin.
<p/>I say she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was starved to death. There was neither fire nor candle; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) died in the dark--in the dark! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) couldn't even see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) children's faces, though we heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gasping out their names.
<p/>When I came back, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they starved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to death.
<p/>I begged for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the streets: and they sent me to prison. I swear it before the God that saw it!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) twined his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hair; and, with a loud scream, rolled grovelling upon the floor: his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes fixed, and the foam covering his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lips.
<p/>The terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been wholly deaf to all that passed, menaced them into silence.
<p/>They starved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!' Having unloosened the cravat of the man who still remained extended on the ground, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tottered towards the undertaker. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was my daughter,'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head in the direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, it is strange that I who gave birth to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and was a woman then, should be alive and merry now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lying there: so cold and stiff!
<p/>Lord, Lord! Lord, Lord!--to think of it; it's as good as a play--as good as a play!'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hideous merriment, the undertaker turned to go away. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stop, stop!'  (<font color='red'><b>the undertaker</b></font>)</div>said the old woman in a loud whisper. <div class="bookquote">` Will she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) be buried to-morrow, or next day, or to-night?
<p/>I laid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out; and I must walk, you know. Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is bitter cold.
<p/>We should have cake and wine, too, before we go! Never mind; send some bread--only a loaf of bread and a cup of water.
<p/>Shall we have some bread, dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said eagerly: catching at the undertaker's coat, as he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) once more moved towards the door. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the undertaker,`of course. Anything you like!' He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) disengaged himself from the old woman's grasp; and, drawing Oliver after him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), hurried away.
<p/>The next day, -LRB-the family having been meanwhile relieved with a half-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble himself,-RRB-
<p/>Oliver and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) master returned to the miserable abode; where Mr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the workhouse, who were to act as bearers.
<p/>An old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin having been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers, and carried into the street. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>whispered Sowerberry in the old woman's ear ; <div class="bookquote">`we are rather late; and it won't do, to keep the clergyman waiting.
<p/>Thus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the two mourners kept as near them, as they could.
<p/>Mr. Bumble and Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs were not so long as his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) master's, ran by the side.
<p/>There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had anticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were made, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by the vestry-room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an hour or so, before he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) came.
<p/>So, they put the bier on the brink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin.
<p/>Move on, my men,--as quick as you like!'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Mr. Sowerberry and Bumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>), and read the paper.
<p/>At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble, and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave.
<p/>Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up appearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) surplice to the clerk, and walked away again. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) surplice as he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) came along. Now, Bill!'  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said Sowerberry to the grave-digger. `
<p/>It was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface.
<p/>The grave-digger shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) feet: shouldered his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Fill up!'  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>Come, my good fellow!' said Bumble, tapping the man on the back. <div class="bookquote">` They want to shut up the yard.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man who had never once moved, since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) station by the grave side, started, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, stared at the person who had addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a swoon.
<p/>The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cloak -LRB-which the undertaker had taken off-RRB-, to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) any attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>); and when he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) came to, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed on their different ways. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, Oliver ,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Sowerberry, as they walked home, <div class="bookquote">`how do you like it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Pretty well, thank you, sir'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, with considerable hesitation. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Not very much, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Ah, you'll get used to it in time, Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Sowerberry. <div class="bookquote">` Nothing when you are used to it, my boy.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sowerberry/Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver wondered, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own mind, whether it had taken a very long time to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) thought it better not to ask the question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) had seen and heard.
<p/>CHAPTER VI OLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND RATHER ASTONISHES HIM The month's trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed.
<p/>In commercial phrase, coffins were looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great deal of experience.
<p/>It was a nice sickly season just at this time. The success of Mr. Sowerberry's ingenious speculation, exceeded even his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) most sanguine hopes.
<p/>The oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town.
<p/>As Oliver accompanied his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) master in most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) adult expeditions too, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker, he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded people bear their trials and losses.
<p/>For instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need be--quite cheerful and contented--conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them.
<p/>Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible.
<p/>It was observable, too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over.
<p/>Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness. All this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration.
<p/>That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people, I cannot, although I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) biographer, undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for many months he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) continued meekly to submit to the domination and ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) far worse than before, now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hatband, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>), the old one, remained stationary in the muffin-cap and leathers.
<p/>Charlotte treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) ill, because Noah did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry was disposed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) friend; so, between these three on one side, and a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was shut up, by mistake, in the grain department of a brewery.
<p/>And now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver's history; for I have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance, but which indirectly produced a material change in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) future prospects and proceedings.
<p/>One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton--a pound and a half of the worst end of the neck--when Charlotte being called out of the way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being hungry and vicious, considered he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.
<p/>Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) feet on the table-cloth; and pulled Oliver's hair; and twitched his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ears; and expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was a <div class="bookquote">`sneak' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and furthermore announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) intention of coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hanged, whenever that desirable event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was.
<p/>But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want to be funny.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) got rather personal. <div class="bookquote">` Work`us,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Noah, <div class="bookquote">`how's your mother?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s dead,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver; <div class="bookquote">`don't you say anything about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to me!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver's colour rose as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) said this; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) breathed quickly; and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying.
<p/>Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,' replied Oliver: more as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) were talking to himself, than answering Noah. `
<p/>Under this impression he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) returned to the charge. <div class="bookquote">` What did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) die of, Work`us?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Noah. <div class="bookquote">` I think I know what it must be to die of that!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work`us,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, as a tear rolled down Oliver's cheek. <div class="bookquote">` What's set you a snivelling now?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not you ,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, sharply. <div class="bookquote">` There; that's enough. Don't say anything more to me about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ; you'd better not!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Better not!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Noah. ` Well! Better not! Work`us, don't be impudent. Your mother, too! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a nice ` un she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was.
<p/>And here, Noah nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) head expressively; and curled up as much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the occasion. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yer know, Work`us,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver's silence, and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most annoying: `Yer know, Work`us, it can't be helped now; and of course yer couldn't help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I'm sure we all are, and pity yer very much.
<p/>But yer must know, Work`us, yer mother was a regular right-down bad <div class="bookquote">`un.'  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What did you say?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And it's a great deal better, Work`us, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did, or else she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d have been hard labouring in Bridewell, or transported, or hung; which is more likely than either, isn't it?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Crimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table; seized Noah by the throat; shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>), in the violence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) rage, till his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) teeth chattered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) head; and collecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) whole force into one heavy blow, felled him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) to the ground.
<p/>Oh, Lor!' A regular right-down bad <div class="bookquote">`un, Work`us,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah, coolly. ` A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breast heaved; his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) attitude was erect; his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eye bright and vivid; his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whole person changed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feet; and defied him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with an energy he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had never known before. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spirit was roused at last; the cruel insult to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dead mother had set his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blood on fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll murder me!'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Noah's shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life, to come further down. `
<p/>blubbered Noah. <div class="bookquote">` Charlotte! missis! Here's the new boy a murdering of me! Help! help! Oliver's gone mad! Char--lotte!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>Oh, you little wretch!'
<p/>screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And between every syllable, Charlotte gave Oliver a blow with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might: accompanying it with a scream, for the benefit of society.
<p/>Charlotte's fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not be effectual in calming Oliver's wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into the kitchen, and assisted to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) with one hand, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face with the other.
<p/>Oh, you little un-grate-ful, mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>In this favourable position of affairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) behind.
<p/>When they were all wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver, struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and there locked him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) up.
<p/>This was rather too violent exercise to last long. This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a chair, and burst into tears. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Charlotte,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry: speaking as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) could, through a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which Noah had poured over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) head and shoulders.
<p/>Bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>)'s going off!' said Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">` A glass of water, Noah, dear. Make haste!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>` Oh! <div class="bookquote">` Oh! Charlotte, what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!'
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/>this'll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Ah! mercy indeed, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>robbers</b></font>)</div>was the reply. I only hope Poor Noah! He (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) was all but killed, ma'am, when I come in.'
<p/>Noah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of Oliver's head, rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes with the inside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), and performed some affecting tears and sniffs. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Your master's not at home; there's not a man in the house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll kick that door down in ten minutes.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Poor fellow!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the charity-boy. What's to be done!' exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. ` Oliver's vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question, rendered this occurance highly probable. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Dear, dear! I don't know, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">`unless we send for the police-officers.'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Or the millingtary,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Claypole. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) to come here directly, and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap!
<p/>No, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver's old friend. ` Make haste! You can hold a knife to that black eye, as you run along.
<p/>Noah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) fullest speed; and very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) head, and a clasp-knife at his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) eye.
<p/>CHAPTER VII OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) swiftest pace, and paused not once for breath, until he (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) reached the workhouse-gate.
<p/>Having rested here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror, he (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) knocked loudly at the wicket; and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that even he (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>), who saw nothing but rueful faces about him (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) at the best of times, started back in astonishment. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It'll keep the swelling down.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Why, what's the matter with the boy!' said the old pauper. <div class="bookquote">` Mr. Bumble! Mr. Bumble!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the pauper</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr. Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) rushed into the yard without his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked hat,--which is a very curious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle, acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of personal dignity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>a beadle</b></font>)</div>said Noah: <div class="bookquote">`Oliver, sir,--Oliver has--'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>` What? What? ` interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) metallic eyes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Not run away; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hasn't run away, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), Noah?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, sir, no. Not run away, sir, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)'s turned wicious,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah. `
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) tried to murder me, sir; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) tried to murder Charlotte; and then missis. Oh! what dreadful pain it is!
<p/>And here, Noah writhed and twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) body into an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr. Bumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was at that moment suffering the acutest torture.
<p/>When Noah saw that the intelligence he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) communicated perfectly paralysed Mr. Bumble, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was more tragic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman aforesaid.
<p/>The gentleman's notice was very soon attracted; for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had not walked three paces, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned angrily round, and inquired what that young cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated, an involuntary process? <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's a poor boy from the free-school, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, <div class="bookquote">`who has been nearly murdered--all but murdered, sir,--by young Twist.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Such agony, please, sir!' <div class="bookquote">` By Jove!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping short. <div class="bookquote">` I knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first, that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness. <div class="bookquote">` And his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) missis,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>interposed Mr. Claypole. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) master, too, I think you said, Noah?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>added Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` No! he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)'s out, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) would have murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Noah. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) wanted to.'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Ah! Said he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) wanted to , did he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>), my boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And please, sir, missis wants to know whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)--'cause master's out.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Certainly, my boy; certainly,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah's head, which was about three inches higher than his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah. ` <div class="bookquote">` You're a good boy--a very good boy. Here's a penny for you. Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry's with your cane, and see what's best to be done.
<p/>And the cocked hat and cane having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner's satisfaction, Mr. Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertaker's shop.
<p/>Don't spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), Bumble.'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, I will not, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle. Here the position of affairs had not at all improved.
<p/>The accounts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) ferocity as related by Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr. Bumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door.
<p/>With this view he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then, applying his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone: <div class="bookquote">`Oliver!'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sowerberry had not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished vigour, at the cellar-door. <div class="bookquote">`Come; you let me out!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>replied Oliver, from the inside. <div class="bookquote">` Do you know this here voice, Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ain't you afraid of it, sir? Ain't you a-trembling while I speak, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` No!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, boldly.
<p/>An answer so different from the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had expected to elicit, and was in the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) full height; and looked from one to another of the three bystanders, in mute astonishment. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) must be mad,'  (<font color='red'><b>the bystanders</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry. <div class="bookquote">` No boy in half his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) senses could venture to speak so to you.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's not Madness, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of deep meditation. <div class="bookquote">` It's Meat.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>` What? ` exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You've raised a artificial soul and spirit in him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), ma'am unbecoming a person of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) condition: as the board, Mrs. Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you.
<p/>Meat, ma'am, meat,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. <div class="bookquote">` You've over-fed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), ma'am. What have paupers to do with soul or spirit?
<p/>It's quite enough that we let 'em have live bodies. If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma'am, this would never have happened.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble's heavy accusation.
<p/>Dear, dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) eyes to the kitchen ceiling: <div class="bookquote">` this comes of being liberal!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>Of which, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) justice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or deed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes down to earth again; <div class="bookquote">`the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) in the cellar for a day or so, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)'s a little starved down; and then to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) out, and keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) on gruel all through the apprenticeship.
<p/>Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well-disposed woman, weeks before.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>At this point of Mr. Bumble's discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to know that some allusion was being made to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mother, recommenced kicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible.
<p/>Oliver's offence having been explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) unlocked the cellar-door in a twinkling, and dragged his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.
<p/>Oliver's clothes had been torn in the beating he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had received; his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face was bruised and scratched; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hair scattered over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was pulled out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) prison, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite undismayed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Sowerberry; giving Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, Mrs. Sowerberry! Sowerberry returned at this juncture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) called my mother names,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, and what if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) did, you little ungrateful wretch?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry. <div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) deserved what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) said, and worse.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) didn't'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) did,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sowerberry. <div class="bookquote">` It's a lie!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerberry</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would have been, according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter.
<p/>To do him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) justice, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, as far as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power went--it was not very extensive--kindly disposed towards the boy; perhaps, because it was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) interest to be so; perhaps, because his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The flood of tears, however, left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no resource; so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs. Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble's subsequent application of the parochial cane, rather unnecessary.
<p/>For the rest of the day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of bread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks outside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte, ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) upstairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) dismal bed.
<p/>It was not until he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings which the day's treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child.
<p/>This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) had borne the lash without a cry:
<p/>for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) felt that pride swelling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they had roasted him (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) alive.
<p/>But now, when there were none to see or hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) knees on the floor; and, hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) hands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!
<p/>For a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The candle was burning low in the socket when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feet.
<p/>Having gazed cautiously round him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), and listened intently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) gently undid the fastenings of the door, and looked abroad. It was a cold, dark night.
<p/>The stars seemed, to the boy's eyes, farther from the earth than he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had ever seen them before; there was no wind; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground, looked sepulchral and death-like, from being so still.
<p/>Having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had, sat himself down upon a bench, to wait for morning.
<p/>With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) softly reclosed the door. One timid look around--one moment's pause of hesitation--he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had closed it behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), and was in the open street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up the hill.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across the fields: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knew, after some distance, led out again into the road; struck into it, and walked quickly on.
<p/>Along this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had trotted beside Mr. Bumble, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) first carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to the workhouse from the farm.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) way lay directly in front of the cottage. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heart beat quickly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bethought himself of this; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) half resolved to turn back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by doing so. Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) being seen; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) walked on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) reached the house. There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour. Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden.
<p/>A child was weeding one of the little beds; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stopped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pale face and disclosed the features of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) former companions.
<p/>Oliver felt glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) went; for, though younger than himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) little friend and playmate.
<p/>said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thin arm between the rails to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>). `
<p/>They had been beaten, and starved, and shut up together, many and many a time. <div class="bookquote">` Hush, Dick!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Is any one up?' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nobody but me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>replied the child. <div class="bookquote">` You musn't say you saw me, Dick,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` I am running away.
<p/>They beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some long way off. I don't know where.
<p/>How pale you are!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>replied the child with a faint smile. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am very glad to see you, dear; but don't stop, don't stop!'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b`ye to you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I shall see you again, Dick. I know I shall! You will be well and happy!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I hope so,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>replied the child. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake.
<p/>After I am dead, but not before. Kiss me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child, climbing up the low gate, and flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) little arms round Oliver's neck.
<p/>The blessing was from a young child's lips, but it was the first that Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head; and through the struggles and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) after life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) never once forgot it.
<p/>A STRANGE SORT OF YOUNG GENTLEMAN Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more gained the high-road.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Good-b`ye, dear! God bless you!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER VIII OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON. HE (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD It was eight o'clock now.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was nearly five miles away from the town, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ran, and hid behind the hedges, by turns, till noon: fearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might be pursued and overtaken.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think, for the first time, where he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had better go and try to live.
<p/>The stone by which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was seated, bore, in large characters, an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London.
<p/>The name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy's mind. London!--that great place!--nobody--not even Mr. Bumble --could ever find him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) there!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too, say that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways of living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of.
<p/>It was the very place for a homeless boy, who must die in the streets unless some one helped him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). As these things passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) jumped upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feet, and again walked forward.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four miles more, before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) recollected how much he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must undergo ere he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could hope to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) place of destination.
<p/>As this consideration forced itself upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) slackened his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pace a little, and meditated upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) means of getting there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a penny too--a gift of Sowerberry's after some funeral in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well--in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A clean shirt,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought Oliver, <div class="bookquote">`is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings; and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>walk in winter time.'
<p/>But Oliver's thoughts, like those of most other people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) little bundle over to the other shoulder, and trudged on.
<p/>Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side.
<p/>When the night came, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined to lie there, till morning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt frightened at first, for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was cold and hungry, and more alone than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever felt before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bundle. Being very tired with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) walk, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) soon fell asleep and forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) troubles.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt cold and stiff, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) got up next morning, and so hungry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very first village through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) passed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had walked no more than twelve miles, when night closed in again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feet were sore, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) legs so weak that they trembled beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>Another night passed in the bleak damp air, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) worse; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) set forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) journey next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could hardly crawl along.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took any notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>): and even those told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to wait till they got to the top of the hill, and then let them see how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could run for a halfpenny.
<p/>Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but was unable to do it, by reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fatigue and sore feet.
<p/>When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was an idle young dog, and didn't deserve anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind.
<p/>In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to jail.
<p/>In others, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) would stand about the inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed: a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady's ordering one of the post-boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of the place, for she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had come to steal something.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) begged at a farmer's house, ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); and when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nose in a shop, they talked about the beadle--which brought Oliver's heart into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mouth,--very often the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had there, for many hours together.
<p/>In fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a benevolent old lady, Oliver's troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mother's; in other words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king's highway.
<p/>But the turnpike-man gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady, who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) what little she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could afford--and more--with such kind and gentle words, and such tears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver's soul, than all the sufferings he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever undergone.
<p/>Early on the seventh morning after he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) native place, Oliver limped slowly into the little town of Barnet.
<p/>This frightened Oliver very much, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition. The window-shutters were closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day.
<p/>The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the light only served to show the boy his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own lonesomeness and desolation, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.
<p/>Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) as they hurried by; but none relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), or troubled themselves to inquire how he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) came there.
<p/>By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up; and people began passing to and fro. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had no heart to beg.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great number of public-houses -LRB-every other house in Barnet was a tavern, large or small-RRB-, gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a whole week of courage and determination beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) years to accomplish: when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was roused by observing that a boy, who had passed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) carelessly some minutes before, had returned, and was now surveying him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) most earnestly from the opposite side of the way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took little heed of this at first; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long, that Oliver raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head, and returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) steady look.
<p/>And there he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sat. Upon this, the boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said, <div class="bookquote">`Hullo, my covey! What's the row?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even seen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was a snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough; and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see; but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) all the airs and manners of a man.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hat was stuck on the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every moment--and would have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head a sudden twitch, which brought it back to its old place again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was short of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) age: with rather bow-legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wore a man's coat, which reached nearly to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heels.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had turned the cuffs back, half-way up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm, to get his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) corduroy trousers; for there he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) kept them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the bluchers. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Hullo, my covey! What's the row?'  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>said this strange young gentleman to Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` I am very hungry and tired,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver: the tears standing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have walked a long way. I have been walking these seven days.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Walking for sivin days!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the young gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, I see. Beak's order, eh? But,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) added, noticing Oliver's look of surprise, <div class="bookquote">`I suppose you don't know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver mildly replied, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had always heard a bird's mouth described by the term in question. <div class="bookquote">` My eyes, how green!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the young gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, a beak's a madgst`rate; and when you walk by a beak's order, it's not straight forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin.
<p/>Why, the mill--the mill as takes up so little room that it'll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind's low with people, than when it's high; acos then they can't get workmen.
<p/>Was you never on the mill?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What mill?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` What mill! But come,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the young gentleman; `you want grub, and you shall have it.
<p/>I'm at low-water-mark myself-- only one bob and a magpie; but, as far as it goes, I'll fork out and stump.
<p/>Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to an adjacent chandler's shop, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham and a half-quartern loaf, or, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) himself expressed it, <div class="bookquote">`a fourpenny bran!'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb, and stuffing it therein.
<p/>Taking the bread under his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) arm, the young gentlman turned into a small public-house, and led the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises.
<p/>Here, a pot of beer was brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver, falling to, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) new friend's bidding, made a long and hearty meal, during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) from time to time with great attention. `
<p/>Up with you on your pins. There! Now then! <div class="bookquote">` Morrice!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Going to London?' said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length concluded. `
<p/>The strange boy whistled; and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) arms into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pockets, as far as the big coat-sleeves would let them go. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes.'  (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Got any lodgings?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Money?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Do you live in London?' inquired Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Yes. I do, when I'm at home,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied the boy. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have not slept under a roof since I left the country.'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Don't fret your eyelids on that score,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the young gentleman. `
<p/>I've got to be in London to-night; and I know a <div class="bookquote">`spectable old gentleman as lives there, wot'll give you lodgings for nothink, and never ask for the change--that is, if any genelman he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows interduces you.
<p/>I suppose you want some place to sleep in to-night, don't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I do, indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>answered Oliver. ` And don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) know me?
<p/>The young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did so.
<p/>This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted; especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a comfortable place, without loss of time.
<p/>This led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) friend's name was Jack Dawkins, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was a peculiar pet and protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.
<p/>Mr. Dawkin's appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) patron's interest obtained for those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) took under his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) protection; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) intimate friends he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was better known by the sobriquet of <div class="bookquote">`The Artful Dodger,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the moral precepts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>Under this impression, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) found the Dodger incorrigible, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) more than half suspected he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should, to decline the honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) farther acquaintance.
<p/>As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it was nearly eleven o'clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington.
<p/>They crossed from the Angel into St. John's Road; struck down the small street which terminates at Sadler's Wells Theatre; through Exmouth Street and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the workhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley-in-the-Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into Saffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace, directing Oliver to follow close at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heels.
<p/>Although Oliver had enough to occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) attention in keeping sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) leader, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) passed along.
<p/>Oh, no! Not in the least! By no means. Certainly not!' A dirtier or more wretched place he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had never seen.
<p/>There were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside.
<p/>The sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place, were the public-houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish were wrangling with might and main.
<p/>Covered ways and yards, which here and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of houses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth; and from several of the door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well-disposed or harmless errands.
<p/>The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy odours. Oliver was just considering whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hadn't better run away, when they reached the bottom of the hill.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) conductor, catching him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) by the arm, pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) into the passage, closed it behind them. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, then!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">` Plummy and slam!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>was the reply.
<p/>This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage; and a man's face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There's two on you,'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said the man, thrusting the candle farther out, and shielding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">` Who's the t`other one?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A new pal,'  (<font color='red'><b>Jack Dawkins/Jack</b></font>)</div>replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward. <div class="bookquote">` Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) come from?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Greenland. Is Fagin upstairs?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oliver, groping his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) way with one hand, and having the other firmly grasped by his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs: which his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was well acquainted with them.
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'s a sortin'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the wipes. Up with you!' The candle was drawn back, and the face disappeared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a candle, stuck in a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf and butter, and a plate.
<p/>In a frying-pan, which was on the fire, and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were cooking; and standing over them, with a toasting-fork in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand, was a very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was dressed in a greasy flannel gown, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) throat bare; and seemed to be dividing his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) attention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging.
<p/>The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt. Several rough beds made of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor.
<p/>Seated round the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men.
<p/>These all crowded about their associate as he (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) whispered a few words to the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver.
<p/>The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) by the hand, and hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should have the honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) intimate acquaintance.
<p/>Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and shook both his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands very hard--especially the one in which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) little bundle.
<p/>One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cap for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); and another was so obliging as to put his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pockets, in order that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was very tired, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might not have the trouble of emptying them, himself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went to bed.
<p/>These civilities would probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal exercise of the Jew's toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them. `
<p/>So did the Jew himself, toasting-fork in hand. <div class="bookquote">` This is him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew toasting-fork</b></font>)</div>said Jack Dawkins;`my friend Oliver Twist.' We are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,' said the Jew. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Dodger, take off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver. Ah, you're a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh, my dear.
<p/>There are a good many of 'em, ain't there? We've just looked 'em out, ready for the wash; that's all, Oliver; that's all.
<p/>The latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman.
<p/>Oliver ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) share, and the Jew then mixed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a glass of hot gin-and-water: telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) must drink it off directly, because another gentleman wanted the tumbler.
<p/>Immediately afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sunk into a deep sleep.
<p/>Ha! ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>In the midst of which they went to supper. Oliver did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was desired. CHAPTER IX CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN, AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) HOPEFUL PUPILS
<p/>There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had satisfied himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) would go on whistling and stirring again, as before.
<p/>It was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep. Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was not thoroughly awake.
<p/>There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness.
<p/>At such time, a mortal knows just enough of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space, when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) saw the Jew with his (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) half-closed eyes; heard his (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) low whistling; and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepan's sides: and yet the self-same senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with almost everybody he (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) had ever known.
<p/>Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) did not well know how to employ himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) turned round and looked at Oliver, and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) name.
<p/>Oliver was precisely in this condition. When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) did not answer, and was to all appearances asleep.
<p/>After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the door: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) fastened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver, from some trap in the floor:
<p/>a small box, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) placed carefully on the table. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes glistened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) raised the lid, and looked in.
<p/>Dragging an old chair to the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sat down; and took from it a magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Aha!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, shrugging up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) shoulders, and distorting every feature with a hideous grin. <div class="bookquote">` Clever dogs! Clever dogs!
<p/>Staunch to the last! Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old Fagin! And why should they?
<p/>It wouldn't have loosened the knot, or kept the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety.
<p/>At least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names.
<p/>There seemed to be some very minute inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hand, pored over it, long and earnestly.
<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) put it down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) chair, muttered: <div class="bookquote">`What a fine thing capital punishment is!
<p/>Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that it lay in the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hand. Dead men never repent; dead men never bring awkward stories to light.
<p/>Ah, it's a fine thing for the trade! Five of 'em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or turn white-livered!'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As the Jew uttered these words, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) bright dark eyes, which had been staring vacantly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), fell on Oliver's face; the boy's eyes were fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only for an instant--for the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceived--it was enough to show the old man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been observed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trembled very much though; for, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) terror, Oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What's that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the Jew. ` What do you watch me for? Why are you awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy!
<p/>Quick--quick! for your life. <div class="bookquote">` I wasn't able to sleep any longer, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, meekly. <div class="bookquote">` I am very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You were not awake an hour ago?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, scowling fiercely on the boy. <div class="bookquote">` No! No, indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Are you sure?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before: and a threatening attitude. <div class="bookquote">` Upon my word I was not, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, earnestly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Tush, tush, my dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, abruptly resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) old manner, and playing with the knife a little, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) laid it down; as if to induce the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had caught it up, in mere sport. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I was not, indeed, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Of course I know that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You're a brave boy.
<p/>Ha! ha! you're a brave boy, Oliver.'  (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div>The Jew rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands with a chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hand upon it after a short pause. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, turning rather pale. ` They--they're mine, Oliver; my little property. All I have to live upon, in my old age.
<p/>Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a good deal of money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) might get up. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The folks call me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that's all.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Certainly, my dear, certainly,' replied the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stay. There's a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here; and I'll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head, the box was gone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew's directions, when the Dodger returned:
<p/>accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally introduced to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) as Charley Bates.
<p/>The four sat down, to breakfast, on the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home in the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself to the Dodger, <div class="bookquote">`I hope you've been at work this morning, my dears?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Hard,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">` As nails,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>added Charley Bates. <div class="bookquote">` Good boys, good boys!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` What have you got, Dodger?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A couple of pocket-books,'  (<font color='red'><b>gentlman</b></font>)</div>replied that young gentlman. <div class="bookquote">` Lined?'  (<font color='red'><b>gentlman</b></font>)</div>inquired the Jew, with eagerness. <div class="bookquote">` Pretty well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one green, and the other red. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Not so heavy as they might be,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, after looking at the insides carefully; `but very neat and nicely made.
<p/>At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to laugh at, in anything that had passed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ingenious workman, ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>), Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Very indeed, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. And what have you got, my dear?' said Fagin to Charley Bates. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Wipes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four pocket-handkerchiefs. <div class="bookquote">` Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, inspecting them closely; <div class="bookquote">`they're very good ones, very.
<p/>You haven't marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall be picked out with a needle, and we'll teach Oliver how to do it.
<p/>Shall us, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew ones</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`If you please, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` You'd like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as Charley Bates, wouldn't you, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the Jew.
<p/>Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly terminated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) premature suffocation. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Very much, indeed, if you'll teach me, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is so jolly green!' said Charley when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) recovered, as an apology to the company for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) unpolite behaviour.
<p/>The Dodger said nothing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) smoothed Oliver's hair over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman, observing Oliver's colour mounting, changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning?
<p/>This made him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious.
<p/>When the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in this way.
<p/>The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) waistcoat pocket, with a guard-chain round his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) neck, and sticking a mock diamond pin in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shirt: buttoned his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) coat tight round him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spectacle-case and handkerchief in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pockets, trotted up and down the room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stopped at the fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was staring with all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might into shop-windows.
<p/>At such times, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would look constantly round him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pockets in turn, to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hadn't lost anything, in such a very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face.
<p/>All this time, the two boys followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) closely about: getting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sight, so nimbly, every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) turned round, that it was impossible to follow their motions.
<p/>At last, the Dodger trod upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) toes, or ran upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) boot accidently, while Charley Bates stumbled up against him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) behind; and in that one moment they took from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, note-case, watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the spectacle-case.
<p/>If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) pockets, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) cried out where it was; and then the game began all over again.
<p/>When this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet, and the other Nancy.
<p/>They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly turned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings.
<p/>They were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of colour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty.
<p/>Being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them very nice girls indeed. As there is no doubt they were.
<p/>Spirits were produced, in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) inside; and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn.
<p/>The visitors stopped a long time. At length, Charley Bates expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) opinion that it was time to pad the hoof.
<p/>This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went away together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with money to spend. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said Fagin. <div class="bookquote">` That's a pleasant life, isn't it? They have gone out for the day.'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Have they done work, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the Jew; <div class="bookquote">`that is, unless they should unexpectedly come across any, when they are out; and they won't neglect it, if they do, my dear, depend upon it.
<p/>Make 'em your models,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) words; <div class="bookquote">`do everything they bid you, and take their advice in all matters--especially the Dodger's, my dear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>)'ll be a great man himself, and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>).--Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, stopping short. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>See if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do, when we were at play this morning.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had seen the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Make 'em your models, my dear. Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Is it gone?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` Here it is, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, showing it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You're a clever boy, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the playful old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head approvingly. <div class="bookquote">` I never saw a sharper lad.
<p/>Here's a shilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you'll be the greatest man of the time. And now come here, and I'll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman's pocket in play, had to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) chances of being a great man.
<p/>But, thinking that the Jew, being so much his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) senior, must know best, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) quietly to the table, and was soon deeply involved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) new study.
<p/>CHAPTER X OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) NEW ASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT, BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY
<p/>For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew's room, picking the marks out of the pocket-handkerchief, -LRB-of which a great number were brought home,-RRB- and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning.
<p/>At length, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to go out to work with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) two companions.
<p/>Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman's character.
<p/>Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by sending them supperless to bed.
<p/>On one occasion, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.
<p/>At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had so eagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two or three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre.
<p/>Perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman's giving his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) assent; but, whether they were or no, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) told Oliver he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might go, and placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) under the joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) friend the Dodger.
<p/>The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) coat-sleeves tucked up, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they were going, and what branch of manufacture he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would be instructed in, first.
<p/>The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter, that Oliver soon began to think his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) companions were going to deceive the old gentleman, by not going to work at all.
<p/>The Dodger had a vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that they seemed to undermine his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) whole suit of clothes in every direction.
<p/>These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) intention of seeking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) way back, in the best way he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could; when his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.
<p/>They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion of terms, <div class="bookquote">`The Green' (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>: when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) lip, drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) companions back again, with the greatest caution and circumspection. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What's the matter?'  (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div>demanded Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">` Do you see that old cove at the book-stall?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The old gentleman over the way?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'ll do,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">` A prime plant,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>observed Master Charley Bates.
<p/>Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) attention had been directed.
<p/>Oliver walked a few paces after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood looking on in silent amazement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was dressed in a bottle-green coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a smart bamboo cane under his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) arm.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had taken up a book from the stall, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stood, reading away, as hard as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) were in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) elbow-chair, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own study.
<p/>It is very possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fancied himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) abstraction, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) saw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short, anything but the book itself: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was reading straight through: turning over the leaf when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) got to the bottom of a page, beginning at the top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest interest and eagerness.
<p/>What was Oliver's horror and alarm as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stood a few paces off, looking on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the Dodger plunge his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hand into the old gentleman's pocket, and draw from thence a handkerchief!
<p/>To see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hand the same to Charley Bates; and finally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full speed!
<p/>In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches, and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy's mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) veins from terror, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were in a burning fire; then, confused and frightened, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heels; and, not knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did, made off as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could lay his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feet to the ground.
<p/>The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a powdered head and gold spectacles. This was all done in a minute's space.
<p/>In the very instant when Oliver began to run, the old gentleman, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pocket, and missing his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) handkerchief, turned sharp round.
<p/>Seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) very naturally concluded him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to be the depredator; and shouting <div class="bookquote">`Stop thief!'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might, made off after him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), book in hand. But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue-and-cry.
<p/>The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner.
<p/>They no sooner heard the cry, and saw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting <div class="bookquote">`Stop thief!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation is the first law of nature.
<p/>Not being prepared, however, it alarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) the more; so away he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) went like the wind, with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). `
<p/>too, joined in the pursuit like good citizens. If he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would have been prepared for this. Stop thief!
<p/>The tradesman leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) counter, and the car-man his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) waggon; the butcher throws down his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) tray; the baker his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) basket; the milkman his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) pail; the errand-boy his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) parcels; the school-boy his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) marbles; the paviour his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) pickaxe; the child his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) battledore.
<p/>helter-skelter, slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stop thief!'  (<font color='red'><b>the passengers</b></font>)</div>There is a magic in the sound. Away they run, pell-mell, Stop thief! Stop thief!' The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and the crowd accumulate at every turning.
<p/>Away they fly, splashing through the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, `Stop thief!
<p/>One wretched breathless child, panting with exhaustion; terror in his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) looks; agony in his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) eyes; large drops of perspiration streaming down his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) face; strains every nerve to make head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) pursuers; and as they follow on his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) track, and gain upon him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) every instant, they hail his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) decreasing strength with joy. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stop thief!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Stop thief! Stop thief!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There is a passion FOR hunting something deeply implanted in the human breast. Stop thief!'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) is down upon the pavement; and the crowd eagerly gather round him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>): each new comer, jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ay, stop him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) for God's sake, were it only in mercy! Stopped at last! A clever blow. Stand aside!'  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Give him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a little air!'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Nonsense! he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) don't deserve it.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Where's the gentleman?'

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Is this the boy, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Yes.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth, looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the pursuers</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`I am afraid it is the boy.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Afraid!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>murmured the crowd. ` That's a good <div class="bookquote">`un!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Poor fellow!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has hurt himself.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` I did that, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward; <div class="bookquote">`and preciously I cut my knuckle agin'  (<font color='red'><b>a fellow</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>The fellow touched his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hat with a grin, expecting something for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with an expression of dislike, look anxiously round, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) contemplated running away himself: which it is very possible he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might have attempted to do, and thus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer -LRB-who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases-RRB- at that moment made his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Come, get up,' said the man, roughly. <div class="bookquote">` It wasn't me indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands passionately, and looking round. `
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) meant this to be ironical, but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They are here somewhere.'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh no, they ain't,'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>said the officer. Come, get up!' <div class="bookquote">`Don't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, compassionately. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh no, I won't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied the officer, tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) jacket half off his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) back, in proof thereof. <div class="bookquote">` Come, I know you; it won't do.
<p/>Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at a rapid pace.
<p/>The gentleman walked on with them by the officer's side; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead, and stared back at Oliver from time to time.
<p/>Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>The boys shouted in triumph; and on they went. CHAPTER XI TREATS OF MR.
<p/>The offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office.
<p/>The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two or three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was led beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of summary justice, by the back way.
<p/>It was a small paved yard into which they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, and a bunch of keys in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT SPECIMEN OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE What's the matter now?'  (<font color='red'><b>a stout man</b></font>)</div>said the man carelessly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A young fogle-hunter,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man who had Oliver in charge. <div class="bookquote">` Are you the party that's been robbed, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired the man with the keys. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, I am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the old gentleman; <div class="bookquote">`but I am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief. I--I would rather not press the case.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Must go before the magistrate now, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man. <div class="bookquote">` His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worship will be disengaged in half a minute. Now, young gallows!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) unlocked as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke, and which led into a stone cell.
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was searched; and nothing being found upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), locked up. This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not so light.
<p/>It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning; and it had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up, elsewhere, since Saturday night.
<p/>In our station-houses, men and women are every night confined on the most trivial charges--the word is worth noting--in dungeons, compared with which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried, found guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces.
<p/>But this is little. Let any one who doubts this, compare the two. The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in the lock.
<p/>There is something in that boy's face,' said the old gentleman to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) walked slowly away, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chin with the cover of the book, in a thoughtful manner; `something that touches and interests me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance. <div class="bookquote">` Can he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) be innocent?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked like-- Bye the bye,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky, `Bless my soul!--where
<p/>After musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there, retiring into a corner, called up before his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind's eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>have I seen something like that look before?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>No,' said the old gentleman, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">`it must be imagination.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman imagination</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wandered over them again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had called them into view, and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them.
<p/>There were the faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven.
<p/>So, he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) heaved a sigh over the recollections he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman, buried them again in the pages of the musty book.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man with the keys to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the office.
<p/>But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver's features bore a trace. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) book hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned Mr. Fang.
<p/>Mr. Fang sat behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene.
<p/>Mr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with no great quantity of hair, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) had, growing on the back and sides of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) head.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) might have brought action against his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) countenance for libel, and have recovered heavy damages.
<p/>The old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate's desk, said, suiting the action to the word, <div class="bookquote">`That is my name and address, sir.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the magistrate</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned.
<p/>Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent decision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>), and commending him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>), for the three hundred and fiftieth time, to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department.
<p/>The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall. His (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) face was stern, and much flushed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) was out of temper; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) looked up with an angry scowl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Who are you?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang. The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) card. <div class="bookquote">` Officer!'  (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Who is this fellow?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` My name, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, speaking like a gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`my name, sir, is Brownlow.
<p/>Permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person, under the protection of the bench.'
 (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Saying this, Mr. Brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) the required information. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Officer!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side, <div class="bookquote">`what's this fellow charged with?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>)'s not charged at all, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>replied the officer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) appears against this boy, your worship.'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and a safe one. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Before I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`and that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could have believed--'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Appears against the boy, does he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?' said Mr. Fang, surveying Mr. Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot. <div class="bookquote">` Swear him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Hold your tongue, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang, peremptorily. <div class="bookquote">` I will not, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>replied the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` Hold your tongue this instant, or I'll have you turned out of the office!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You're an insolent impertinent fellow. How dare you bully a magistrate!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening. <div class="bookquote">` Swear this person!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Fang to the clerk. `
<p/>Mr. Brownlow's indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) suppressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) feelings and submitted to be sworn at once. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'll not hear another word. Swear him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Now,' said Fang, <div class="bookquote">`what's the charge against this boy? What have you got to say, sir?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I was standing at a bookstall--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brownlow began. <div class="bookquote">` Hold your tongue, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang. ` Policeman! Where's the policeman?
<p/>The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) had taken the charge; how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) person; and how that was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) knew about it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Here, swear this policeman. Now, policeman, what is this?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Are there any witnesses?' inquired Mr. Fang. <div class="bookquote">` None, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>replied the policeman.
<p/>Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the prosecutor, said in a towering passion. <div class="bookquote">` Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or do you not?
<p/>Now, if you stand there, refusing to give evidence, I'll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will, by--'  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>By what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor, thus preventing the word from being heard--accidently, of course.
<p/>With many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived to state his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) case; observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had run after the boy because he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) running away; and expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hope that, if the magistrate should believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), although not actually the thief, to be connected with the thieves, he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) would deal as leniently with him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) as justice would allow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You have been sworn. He (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) has been hurt already,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman in conclusion. <div class="bookquote">` And I fear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, <div class="bookquote">`I really fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is ill.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh! yes, I dare say!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang, with a sneer. <div class="bookquote">` Come, none of your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won't do.
<p/>What's your name?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>Oliver tried to reply but his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) tongue failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was deadly pale; and the whole place seemed turning round and round. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What's your name, you hardened scoundrel?'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>demanded Mr. Fang. <div class="bookquote">` Officer, what's his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) name?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>This was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who was standing by the bar.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) bent over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry; but finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) really incapable of understanding the question; and knowing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more, and add to the severity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sentence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hazarded a guess. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) says his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) name's Tom White, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the kind-hearted thief-taker. <div class="bookquote">` Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) won't speak out, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Fang.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Very well, very well. Where does he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) live?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Where he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) can, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>replied the officer; again pretending to receive Oliver's answer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) any parents?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Fang. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) says they died in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) infancy, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>replied the officer: hazarding the usual reply.
<p/>At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head; and, looking round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stuff and nonsense!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang: <div class="bookquote">`don't try to make a fool of me.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) really is ill, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>remonstrated the officer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I know better,'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fang. <div class="bookquote">` Take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>), officer,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands instinctively; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'ll fall down.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stand away, officer,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>cried Fang; <div class="bookquote">`let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) likes.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>Oliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in a fainting fit.
<p/>The men in the office looked at each other, but no one dared to stir. <div class="bookquote">` I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was shamming,'  (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div>said Fang, as if this were incontestable proof of the fact. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) lie there; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>)'ll soon be tired of that.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>inquired the clerk in a low voice. `
<p/>The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cell; when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed hastily into the office, and advanced towards the bench. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Summarily,'  (<font color='red'><b>an man</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Fang. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) stands committed for three months--hard labour of course. Clear the office.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>Stop, stop! don't take him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) away!
<p/>Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the character, almost the lives, of Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) Majesty's subjects, expecially of the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily press.-LSB-Footnote:
<p/>For Heaven's sake stop a moment!' cried the new comer, breathless with haste. Or were virtually, then.-RSB- Mr. Fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What is this? Who is this? Turn this man out. Clear the office!'  (<font color='red'><b>an guest</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Fang. <div class="bookquote">` I will speak,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>cried the man; <div class="bookquote">`I will not be turned out.
<p/>I saw it all. I keep the book-stall. I demand to be sworn. I will not be put down. Mr. Fang, you must hear me.
<p/>You must not refuse, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>The man was right. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner was determined; and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Swear the man,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill grace. <div class="bookquote">` Now, man, what have you got to say?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man: <div class="bookquote">`I saw three boys: two others and the prisoner here: loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman was reading.
<p/>The robbery was committed by another boy. I saw it done; and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Having by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book-stall keeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why didn't you come here before?'  (<font color='red'><b>the book-stall keeper</b></font>)</div>said Fang, after a pause. <div class="bookquote">` I hadn't a soul to mind the shop,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>replied the man. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Everybody who could have helped me, had joined in the pursuit. I could get nobody till five minutes ago; and I've run here all the way.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` The prosecutor was reading, was he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>inquired Fang, after another pause. <div class="bookquote">` Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>replied the man. <div class="bookquote">` The very book he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Oh, that book, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>said Fang. <div class="bookquote">` Is it paid for?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, it is not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, with a smile. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Fang, with a comical effort to look humane. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I consider, sir, that you have obtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute.
<p/>Dear me, I forgot all about it!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fang/Fang</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the absent old gentleman, innocently. <div class="bookquote">` Let this be a lesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet.
<p/>The boy is discharged. Clear the office!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` D--n me!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had kept down so long, 'd--n me!
<p/>The mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed out, with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other: in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance.
<p/>I'll--' <div class="bookquote">` Clear the office!'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the magistrate. <div class="bookquote">` Officers, do you hear? Clear the office!'  (<font color='red'><b>the magistrate</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) reached the yard; and his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) passion vanished in a moment.
<p/>Little Oliver Twist lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) back on the pavement, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) shirt unbuttoned, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) temples bathed with water; his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) whole frame. `
<p/>A coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Poor boy, poor boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Call a coach, somebody, pray. Directly!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>May I accompany you?' said the book-stall keeper, looking in. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bless me, yes, my dear sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow quickly. <div class="bookquote">` I forgot you. Dear, dear! I have this unhappy book still!
<p/>Jump in. Poor fellow! There's no time to lose.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>The book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove. CHAPTER XII IN WHICH OLIVER
<p/>IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) EVER WAS BEFORE. AND IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN
<p/>The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which Oliver had traversed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) first entered London in company with the Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady street near Pentonville.
<p/>Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) young charge carefully and comfortably deposited; and here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds.
<p/>The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever.
<p/>The worm does not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame.
<p/>AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) YOUTHFUL FRIENDS. But, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) new friends. Weak, and thin, and pallid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream.
<p/>Feebly raising himself in the bed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) trembling arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) looked anxiously around. <div class="bookquote">` What room is this?
<p/>Where have I been brought to?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` This is not the place I went to sleep in.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak; but they were overheard at once.
<p/>The curtain at the bed's head was hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely dressed, rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been sitting at needle-work. `
<p/>You must be very quiet, or you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,--as bad as bad could be, pretty nigh.
<p/>With those words, the old lady very gently placed Oliver's head upon the pillow; and, smoothing back his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hair from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) forehead, looked so kindly and loving in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not help placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) little withered hand in hers, and drawing it round his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) neck. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Hush, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the old lady softly. <div class="bookquote">` Lie down again; there's a dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Save us!' said the old lady, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What a grateful little dear it is. Pretty creetur! What would his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mother feel if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had sat by him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) as I have, and could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) now!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does see me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>whispered Oliver, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands together; <div class="bookquote">`perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has sat by me. I almost feel as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>I suppose it was,' replied Oliver, `because heaven is a long way off; and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor boy.
<p/>But if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew I was ill, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must have pitied me, even there; for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was very ill herself before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` That was the fever, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the old lady mildly. <div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) can't know anything about me though,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>added Oliver after a moment's silence. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had seen me hurt, it would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sorrowful; and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face has always looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes first, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver to drink; and then, patting him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) on the cheek, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) must lie very quiet, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would be ill again.
<p/>So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was completely exhausted with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had already said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) soon fell into a gentle doze, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was awakened by the light of a candle: which, being brought near the bed, showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a gentleman with a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand, who felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pulse, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was a great deal better. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You are a great deal better, are you not, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, thank you, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, I know you are,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman: <div class="bookquote">`You're hungry too, an't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>answered Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Hem!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought the doctor was a very clever man.
<p/>No, I know you're not. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is not hungry, Mrs. Bedwin,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman: looking very wise. The doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You feel sleepy, don't you, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">` No, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You're not sleepy. Nor thirsty. Are you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, sir, rather thirsty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>answered Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's very natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) should be thirsty. You may give him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) a little tea, ma'am, and some dry toast without any butter.
<p/>Don't keep him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) too warm, ma'am; but be careful that you don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) be too cold; will you have the goodness?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor, after tasting the cool stuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away: his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) went downstairs.
<p/>The old lady dropped a curtsey. Oliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) awoke, it was nearly twelve o'clock.
<p/>The old lady tenderly bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) good-night shortly afterwards, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in charge of a fat old woman who had just come: bringing with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a large nightcap.
<p/>Putting the latter on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head and the former on the table, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had come to sit up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), drew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward, and divers moans and chokings.
<p/>These, however, had no worse effect than causing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to rub her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nose very hard, and then fall asleep again. And thus the night crept slowly on.
<p/>Oliver lay awake for some time, counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall.
<p/>The darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into the boy's mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many days and nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) awful presence, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face upon the pillow, and fervently prayed to Heaven.
<p/>Gradually, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from.
<p/>Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present; its anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of the past!
<p/>It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt cheerful and happy. The crisis of the disease was safely past.
<p/>In three days' time he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped up with pillows; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) carried downstairs into the little housekeeper's room, which belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bedwin</b></font>).
<p/>Having him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) set, here, by the fire-side, the good old lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) so much better, forthwith began to cry most violently. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) belonged to the world again. Never mind me, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the old lady; <div class="bookquote">`I'm only having a regular good cry.
<p/>There; it's all over now; and I'm quite comfortable.'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You're very, very kind to me, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Well, never you mind that, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the old lady; <div class="bookquote">`that's got nothing to do with your broth; and
<p/>it's full time you had it; for the doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)'ll be pleased.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth: strong enough, Oliver thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest computation. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Are you fond of pictures, dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>paupers</b></font>)</div>inquired the old lady, seeing that Oliver had fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung against the wall; just opposite his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't quite know, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, without taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes from the canvas; <div class="bookquote">`I have seen so few that I hardly know.
<p/>Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, <div class="bookquote">`painters always make ladies out prettier than they are, or they wouldn't get any custom, child.
<p/>The man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never succeed; it's a deal too honest.
<p/>What a beautiful, mild face that lady's is!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` A deal,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, laughing very heartily at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own acuteness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Is--is that a likeness, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth; <div class="bookquote">`that's a portrait.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Whose, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asked Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Why, really, my dear, I don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>answered the old lady in a good-humoured manner. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's not a likeness of anybody that you or I know, I expect. It seems to strike your fancy, dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`It is so pretty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, sure you're not afraid of it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the old lady: observing in great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh no, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>returned Oliver quickly; <div class="bookquote">`but the eyes look so sorrowful; and where I sit , they seem fixed upon me.
<p/>It makes my heart beat,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>added Oliver in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">`as if it was alive, and wanted to speak to me, but couldn't.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Lord save us!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old lady, starting; <div class="bookquote">`don't talk in that way, child. You're weak and nervous after your illness.
<p/>Let me wheel your chair round to the other side; and then you won't see it. There!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, suiting the action to the word; <div class="bookquote">`you don't see it now, at all events.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver did see it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mind's eye as distinctly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had not altered his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) position; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thought it better not to worry the kind old lady; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) smiled gently when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); and Mrs. Bedwin, satisfied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful, when there came a soft rap at the door. <div class="bookquote">`Come in,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow.
<p/>Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had no sooner raised his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spectacles on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) forehead, and thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands behind the skirts of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dressing-gown to take a good long look at Oliver, than his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions.
<p/>Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) benefactor, which terminated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sinking back into the chair again; and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow's heart, being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition, forced a supply of tears into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) eyes, by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition. Poor boy, poor boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>any gentlemen</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) throat. <div class="bookquote">` I'm rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin.
<p/>I'm afraid I have caught cold.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I hope not, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bedwin/Bedwin</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bedwin. <div class="bookquote">` Everything you have had, has been well aired, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bedwin/Bedwin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`I rather think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday; but never mind that.
<p/>I don't know, Bedwin. How do you feel, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Very happy, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` And very grateful indeed, sir, for your goodness to me.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,' replied Mrs. Bedwin: drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the last word: to intimate that between slops, and broth will compounded, there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ugh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bedwin/Bedwin</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; <div class="bookquote">`a couple of glasses of port wine would have done him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) a great deal more good.
<p/>Wouldn't they, Tom White, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`My name is Oliver, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the little invalid: with a look of great astonishment. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Good by,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly. <div class="bookquote">` Have you given him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) any nourishment, Bedwin? Any slops, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`Oliver what?
<p/>Oliver White, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Queer name!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` What made you tell the magistrate your name was White?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I never told him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) so, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>returned Oliver in amazement.
<p/>This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in Oliver's face. It was impossible to doubt him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments. `
<p/>But, although his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) motive for looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the resemblance between his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) features and some familiar face came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) so strongly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not withdraw his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) gaze. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Some mistake,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow. I hope you are not angry with me, sir?' said Oliver, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes beseechingly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` Why! what's this? Bedwin, look there!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver's head, and then to the boy's face.
<p/>There was its living copy. The eyes, the head, the mouth; every feature was the same. The expression was, for the instant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy!
<p/>Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fainted away.
<p/>A weakness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording-- That when the Dodger, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) accomplished friend Master Bates, joined in the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver's heels, in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow's personal property, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need hardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid down as the main-springs of all Nature's deeds and actions: the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady's proceedings to matters of maxim and theory: and, by a very neat and pretty compliment to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling.
<p/>For, these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) sex.
<p/>If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament, I should at once find it in the fact -LRB-also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative-RRB-, of their quitting the pursuit, when the general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut.
<p/>Although I do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages, to shorten the road to any great conclusion -LRB-their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge-RRB-; still, I do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories, to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves.
<p/>Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and you may take any means which the end to be attained, will justify; the amount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher concerned, to be settled and determined by his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) clear, comprehensive, and impartial view of his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) own particular case.
<p/>It was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway.
<p/>Having remained silent here, just long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What's the matter?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>inquired the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">` Ha! ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>roared Charley Bates. <div class="bookquote">` Hold your noise,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>To see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) splitting away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and knocking up again'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>the posts, and starting on again as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) was made of iron as well as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out arter him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>)--oh, my eye!'
<p/>Do you want to be grabbed, stupid?' <div class="bookquote">`I can't help it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley, <div class="bookquote">`I can't help it! The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented the scene before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) in too strong colours.
<p/>What'll Fagin say?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) friend to propound the question. `
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) arrived at this apostrophe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than before. <div class="bookquote">` What?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>repeated Charley Bates. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ah, what?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">` Why, what should he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) say?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>inquired Charley: stopping rather suddenly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) merriment; for the Dodger's manner was impressive. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What should he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) say?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) hat, scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) head, and nodded thrice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Toor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) wouldn't, and high cockolorum,'  (<font color='red'><b>thrice</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger: with a slight sneer on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) intellectual countenance.
<p/>What do you mean?' said Charley. ` This was explanatory, but not satisfactory. Master Bates felt it so; and again said, <div class="bookquote">`What do you mean?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>The Dodger made no reply; but putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hat on again, and gathering the skirts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) long-tailed coat under his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) arm, thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) tongue into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) cheek, slapped the bridge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) nose some half-dozen times in a familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) heel, slunk down the court.
<p/>The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand; a pocket-knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right; and a pewter pot on the trivet.
<p/>There was a rascally smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) white face as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned round, and looking sharply out from under his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thick red eyebrows, bent his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ear towards the door, and listened. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance. Why, how's this?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>muttered the Jew: changing countenance; <div class="bookquote">`only two of 'em? Where's the third?
<p/>They can't have got into trouble. Hark!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>The footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing. The door was slowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it behind them.
<p/>CHAPTER XIII SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER, CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED, APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY `Where's Oliver?
<p/>` said the Jew, rising with a menacing look. <div class="bookquote">` Where's the boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>The young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) violence; and looked uneasily at each other.
<p/>What's become of the boy?' said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by the collar, and threatening him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) with horrid imprecations. `
<p/>Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) turn to be throttled second, dropped upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) knees, and raised a loud, well-sustained, and continuous roar--something between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Will you speak?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>thundered the Jew: shaking the Dodger so much that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous. `
<p/>But they made no reply. <div class="bookquote">` Speak out, or I'll throttle you!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Why, the traps have got him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>), and that's all about it,' said the Dodger, sullenly. `
<p/>And, swinging himself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) left in the Jew's hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass at the merry old gentleman's waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect, would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily replaced.
<p/>The Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) apparent decrepitude; and, seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assailant's head.
<p/>But Charley Bates, at this moment, calling his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) attention by a perfectly terrific howl, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full at that young gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Come, let go o'  (<font color='red'><b>that gentleman</b></font>)</div>me, will you!' Why, what the blazes is in the wind now!' growled a deep voice. `
<p/>Who pitched that <div class="bookquote">`ere at me? It's well it's the beer, and not the pot, as hit me, or I'd have settled somebody.
<p/>I might have know'd, as nobody but an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to throw away any drink but water--and not that, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) done the River Company every quarter.
<p/>Wot's it all about, Fagin? D--me, if my neck-handkercher an't lined with beer! Come in, you sneaking warmint; wot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of your master!
<p/>The man who growled out these words, was a stoutly-built fellow of about five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab breeches, lace-up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs, with large swelling calves;--the kind of legs, which in such costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had a brown hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) neck: with the long frayed ends of which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) smeared the beer from his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) spoke.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) disclosed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had done so, a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Come in!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Come in, d'ye hear?' growled this engaging ruffian. A white shaggy dog, with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) face scratched and torn in twenty different places, skulked into the room. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why didn't you come in afore?'  (<font color='red'><b>A shaggy dog</b></font>)</div>said the man. ` You're getting too proud to own me afore company, are you?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared well used to it, however; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coiled himself up in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound, and winking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very ill-looking eyes twenty times in a minute, appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Lie down!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the other end of the room. What are you up to?
<p/>Ill-treating the boys, you covetous, avaricious, in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence? ` said the man, seating himself deliberately. ` I wonder they don't murder you!
<p/>If I'd been your <div class="bookquote">`prentice, I'd have done it long ago, and--no, I couldn't have sold you afterwards, for you're fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle, and I suppose they don't blow glass bottles large enough.'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I would if I was them. <div class="bookquote">` Hush! hush! Mr. Sikes,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, trembling; <div class="bookquote">`don't speak so loud!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` None of your mistering,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the ruffian; <div class="bookquote">`you always mean mischief when you come that.
<p/>You know my name: out with it! I shan't disgrace it when the time comes.'  (<font color='red'><b>the ruffian</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well, well, then--Bill Sikes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, with abject humility. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Perhaps I am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`I should think you was rather out of sorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about, as you do when you blab and--'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Are you mad?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and pointing towards the boys.
<p/>Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) left ear, and jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb show which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) then, in cant terms, with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled, but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here, demanded a glass of liquor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You seem out of humour, Bill.'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And mind you don't poison it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hat upon the table.
<p/>This was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the Jew bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pale lip as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) turned round to the cupboard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish -LRB-at all events-RRB- to improve upon the distiller's ingenuity not very far from the old gentleman's merry heart.
<p/>After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious act led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver's capture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and improvements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'm afraid,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) may say something which will get us into trouble.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` That's very likely,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>returned Sikes with a malicious grin. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And I'm afraid, you see,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>added the Jew, speaking as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had not noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) did so,--`I'm afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with a good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me, my dear.'
<p/>But the old gentleman's shoulders were shrugged up to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ears; and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall.
<p/>Every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by a certain malicious licking of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) might encounter in the streets when he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) went out. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Somebody must find out wot's been done at the office,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes in a much lower tone than he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had taken since he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) came in.
<p/>You're blowed upon, Fagin.' ` The man started, and turned round upon the Jew. There was a long pause. The Jew nodded assent. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hasn't peached, and is committed, there's no fear till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) comes out again,'  (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, <div class="bookquote">`and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) must be taken care on.
<p/>The prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but, unfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being adopted.
<p/>This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and Mr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and deeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or pretext whatever.
<p/>You must get hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) somehow.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>Again the Jew nodded. How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of uncertainty
<p/>It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject, however; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to guess. The very thing!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` Bet will go; won't you, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Wheres?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>inquired the young lady. `
<p/>It is due to the young lady to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not positively affirm that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be <div class="bookquote">`blessed'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would; a polite and delicate evasion of the request, which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow-creature, the pain of a direct and pointed refusal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned from this young lady, who was gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and yellow curl-papers, to the other female. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Only just up to the office, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the female</b></font>)</div>said the Jew coaxingly. The Jew's countenance fell. Nancy, my dear,' said the Jew in a soothing manner, <div class="bookquote">`what do YOU say?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` That it won't do; so it's no use a-trying it on, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy. <div class="bookquote">` What do you mean by that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly manner. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What I say, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied the lady collectedly. <div class="bookquote">` Why, you're just the very person for it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>reasoned Mr. Sikes: <div class="bookquote">`nobody about here knows anything of you.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And as I don't want 'em to, neither,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy in the same composed manner, <div class="bookquote">`it's rather more no than yes with me, Bill.'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)'ll go, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) won't, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Nancy. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) will, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Sikes. And Mr. Sikes was right.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was not, indeed, withheld by the same considerations as her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) agreeable friend; for, having recently removed into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb of Ratcliffe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) numerous acquaintances.
<p/>Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) gown, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,--both articles of dress being provided from the Jew's inexhaustible stock,--Miss
<p/>By dint of alternate threats, promises, and bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission. Nancy prepared to issue forth on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) errand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It looks more respectable, my dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) a door-key to carry in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) t`other one, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`it looks real and genivine like.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, yes, my dear, so it does,' said the Jew, hanging a large street-door key on the forefinger of the young lady's right hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stop a minute, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, producing, a little covered basket. ` Carry that in one hand. <div class="bookquote">` There; very good!
<p/>My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket and the street-door key in an agony of distress. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Very good indeed, my dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">` Oh, my brother! What has become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)! Where have they taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) to!
<p/>Oh, do have pity, and tell me what's been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please, gentlemen!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone: to the immeasurable delight of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hearers: Miss Nancy paused, winked to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)'s a clever girl, my dears,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, turning round to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) young friends, and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head gravely, as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)'s a honour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) sex,'  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) glass, and smiting the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) enormous fist. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>While these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the accomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) way to the police-office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards.
<p/>Here's her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) health, and wishing they was all like her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>Entering by the back way, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tapped softly with the key at one of the cell-doors, and listened.
<p/>There was no sound within: so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) coughed and listened again. Still there was no reply: so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">` Nolly, dear?'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society having been clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr. Fang to the House of Correction for one month; with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) had so much breath to spare, it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the use of the county: so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked there. `
<p/>murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; <div class="bookquote">` Nolly?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>Well!' cried a faint and feeble voice. <div class="bookquote">` Is there a little boy here?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>inquired Nancy, with a preliminary sob. `
<p/>This was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison for not playing the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and doing nothing for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) livelihood.
<p/>In the next cell was another man, who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license; thereby doing something for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) living, in defiance of the Stamp-office.
<p/>But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or knew anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street-door key and the little basket, demanded her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) own dear brother. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No,'  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>replied the voice; <div class="bookquote">`God forbid.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I haven't got him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), my dear,' said the old man. <div class="bookquote">` Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner. `
<p/>In reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office, and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the prosecutor had carried him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) away, in an insensible condition, to his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) own residence: of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that it was somewhere in Pentonville, he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman.
<p/>In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) faltering walk for a swift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could think of, to the domicile of the Jew.
<p/>Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hat, expeditiously departed: without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company good-morning. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, the gentleman's got him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div>replied the officer. <div class="bookquote">` What gentleman! Oh, gracious heavens! What gentleman?'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Nancy. We must know where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is, my dears; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) must be found,' said the Jew greatly excited. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Charley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring home some news of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)! Nancy, my dear, I must have him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) found.
<p/>I trust to you, my dear,--to you and the Artful for everything! Stay, stay,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand
<p/>; <div class="bookquote">`there's money, my dears. I shall shut up this shop to-night. You'll know where to find me! Don't stop here a minute.
<p/>With these words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pushed them from the room: and carefully double-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of concealment the box which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver.
<p/>Not an instant, my dears!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) clothing. A rap at the door startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in this occupation. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Who's there?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) cried in a shrill tone. <div class="bookquote">` Me!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole. <div class="bookquote">` What now?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew impatiently. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">` Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) lays hands on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>).
<p/>Find him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), find him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) out, that's all. I shall know what to do next; never fear.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>The boy murmured a reply of intelligence: and hurried downstairs after his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) companions. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has not peached so far,'  (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div>said the Jew as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) occupation. <div class="bookquote">` If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) means to blab us among his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) new friends, we may stop his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) mouth yet.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIV COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER'S STAY AT MR. BROWNLOW'S, WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM,
<p/>WHEN HE (<font color='blue'><b>GRIMWIG</b></font>) WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND Oliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow's abrupt exclamation had thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), the subject of the picture was carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the conversation that ensued: which indeed bore no reference to Oliver's history or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was still too weak to get up to breakfast; but, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) came down into the housekeeper's room next day, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) expectations were disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed. <div class="bookquote">` Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver's eyes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is gone, you see.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I see it is ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Why have they taken it away?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you know,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined the old lady. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, no, indeed. It didn't worry me, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` I liked to see it. I quite loved it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, well!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, good-humouredly; <div class="bookquote">`you get well as fast as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again.
<p/>There! I promise you that! Now, let us talk about something else.'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at that time.
<p/>As the old lady had been so kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) illness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) listened attentively to a great many stories she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome man, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man, and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year, that it brought the tears into her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) eyes to talk about them.
<p/>When the old lady had expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) children, and the merits of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone, poor dear soul!
<p/>After tea she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) learnt as quickly as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could teach: and at which game they played, with great interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily to bed.
<p/>Everything was so quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had always lived, it seemed like Heaven itself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was no sooner strong enough to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) clothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and a new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>).
<p/>As Oliver was told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) liked with the old clothes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) to sell them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself.
<p/>This she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) very readily did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew roll them up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bag and walk away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ever being able to wear them again.
<p/>just six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea. They were happy days, those of Oliver's recovery. They were sad rags, to tell the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before.
<p/>One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr. Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) should like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) study, and talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) a little while. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bless us, and save us! Wash your hands, and let me part your hair nicely for you, child,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bedwin. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If we had known he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean collar on, and made you as smart as sixpence!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bedwin/Bedwin</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver did as the old lady bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); and, although she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lamented grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) shirt-collar; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) looked so delicate and handsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went so far as to say: looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) with great complacency from head to foot, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) really didn't think it would have been possible, on the longest notice, to have made much difference in him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) for the better.
<p/>On Mr. Brownlow calling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) to come in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) found himself in a little back room, quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little gardens.
<p/>Dear heart alive! Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door. There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr. Brownlow was seated reading.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) saw Oliver, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pushed the book away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to come near the table, and sit down.
<p/>Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser.
<p/>There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?' said Mr. Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling. `
<p/>Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver Twist, every day of their lives. <div class="bookquote">` A great number, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You shall read them, if you behave well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman kindly; <div class="bookquote">`and you will like that, better than looking at the outsides,--that is, some cases; because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>I suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,' said Oliver, pointing to some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head, and smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) did so; <div class="bookquote">`there are other equally heavy ones, though of a much smaller size.
<p/>I never saw so many.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">` Not always those How should you like to grow up a clever man, and write books, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I think I would rather read them, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` What! wouldn't you like to be a book-writer?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman.
<p/>Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should think it would be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had said a very good thing.
<p/>Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) by no means knew what it was. <div class="bookquote">` Well, well,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, composing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) features. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't be afraid! We won't make an author of you, while there's an honest trade to be learnt, or brick-making to turn to.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>At the earnest manner of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) reply, the old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention to. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) assume yet, <div class="bookquote">`I want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am going to say.
<p/>I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am sure you are well able to understand me, as many older persons would be.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, don't tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!' exclaimed Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman's commencement! `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Thank you, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Don't turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again. Let me stay here, and be a servant.
<p/>My dear child,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of Oliver's sudden appeal; <div class="bookquote">`you need not be afraid of my deserting you, unless you give me cause.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Don't send me back to the wretched place I came from. Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!' ` <div class="bookquote">` I never, never will, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>a boy sir</b></font>)</div>interposed Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you, nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well account for, even to myself.
<p/>The persons on whom I have bestowed my dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections.
<p/>I hope not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>rejoined the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` I do not think you ever will. Deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>As the old gentleman said this in a low voice: more to himself than to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) companion: and as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) remained silent for a short time afterwards: Oliver sat quite still. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, well!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful tone, `I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful, perhaps, not to wound me again.
<p/>You say you are an orphan, without a friend in the world; all the inquiries I have been able to make, confirm the statement.
<p/>Let me hear your story; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found you.
<p/>Oliver's sobs checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) utterance for some minutes; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was on the point of beginning to relate how he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been brought up at the farm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly impatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door: and the servant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Speak the truth, and you shall not be friendless while I live.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) coming up?' inquired Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied the servant. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) asked if there were any muffins in the house; and, when I told him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had come to tea.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was an old friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) must not mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) being a little rough in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) manners; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) was a worthy creature at bottom, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) had reason to know. `
<p/>At this moment, there walked into the room: supporting himself by a thick stick: a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with green.
<p/>A very small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) waistcoat; and a very long steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end, dangled loosely below it.
<p/>The ends of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes into which his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) countenance was twisted, defy description.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had a manner of screwing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head on one side when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spoke; and of looking out of the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes at the same time: which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot.
<p/>In this attitude, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fixed himself, the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) appearance; and, holding out a small piece of orange-peel at arm's length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented voice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Shall I go downstairs, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`I would rather you remained here.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>Look here! do you see this!
<p/>Isn't it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that I can't call at a man's house but I find a piece of this poor surgeon's friend on the staircase?
<p/>I've been lamed with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I'll be content to eat my own head, sir!'
<p/>This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) made; and it was the more singular in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own head in the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) being so disposed, Mr. Grimwig's head was such a particularly large one, that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting--to put entirely out of the question, a very thick coating of powder. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'll eat my head, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) stick upon the ground. <div class="bookquote">` Hallo! what's that!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>looking at Oliver, and retreating a pace or two. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You don't mean to say that's the boy who had the fever, I hope?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow. Oliver bowed. <div class="bookquote">` Wait a minute! Don't speak!
<p/>Stop--'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) triumph at the discovery; <div class="bookquote">`that's the boy who had the orange!
<p/>If that's not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase, I'll eat my head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) too.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Put down your hat; and speak to my young friend.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I feel strongly on this subject, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the irritable old gentleman, drawing off his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gloves. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There's always more or less orange-peel on the pavement in our street; and I know it's put there by the surgeon's boy at the corner.
<p/>No, no, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has not had one,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, laughing. <div class="bookquote">` Come! A young woman stumbled over a bit last night, and fell against my garden-railings; directly she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got up
<p/>I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) look towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light. '' Don't go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>),'' I called out of the window, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)'s an assassin!
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is not--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>Here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stick; which was always understood, by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) friends, to imply the customary offer, whenever it was not expressed in words.
<p/>Then, still keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stick in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver: who, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A man-trap! '' So he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is. That's the boy, is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig, at length. <div class="bookquote">` That's the boy,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow. `
<p/>Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) singular friend was about to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) did not half like the visitor's manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was very happy to do. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>How are you, boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig. <div class="bookquote">` A great deal better, thank you, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is a nice-looking boy, is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) not?' inquired Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly. <div class="bookquote">` Don't know?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No. I don't know. I never see any difference in boys.
<p/>I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they call him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a wolf.
<p/>I only knew two sort of boys. Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And which is Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Mealy. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)!
<p/>The wretch!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Come,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`these are not the characteristics of young Oliver Twist; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) needn't excite your wrath.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` They are not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Grimwig. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) may have worse.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>Here, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr. Grimwig the most exquisite delight. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) may have worse, I say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Grimwig. ` Where does he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) come from! Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)? What is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) has had a fever. What of that? Fevers are not peculiar to good people; are they? Bad people have fevers sometimes; haven't they, eh?
<p/>I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for murdering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had a fever six times; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wasn't recommended to mercy on that account.
<p/>Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own heart, Mr. Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver's appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) had a strong appetite for contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whether a boy was well-looking or not, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had resolved, from the first, to oppose his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) friend.
<p/>When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had postponed any investigation into Oliver's previous history until he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled maliciously.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) didn't find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) would be content to--and so forth.
<p/>All this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman: knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) friend's peculiarities, bore with great good humour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) entire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and Oliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ease than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had yet done in the fierce old gentleman's presence. `
<p/>And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?
<p/>` asked Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) subject. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Pooh! nonsense!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To-morrow morning,' replied Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">` I would rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was alone with me at the time. Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten o'clock, my dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) answered with some hesitation, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was confused by Mr. Grimwig's looking so hard at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'll tell you what,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) won't come up to you to-morrow morning. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hesitate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is deceiving you, my good friend.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I'll swear he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly. <div class="bookquote">` If he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig, <div class="bookquote">`I'll--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>and down went the stick.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` I'll answer for that boy's truth with my life!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, knocking the table. <div class="bookquote">` And I for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) falsehood with my head!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking the table also. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We shall see,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) rising anger. <div class="bookquote">` We will,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile; <div class="bookquote">`we will.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div><p/>As fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment, a small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this history; having laid them on the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bedwin</b></font>) prepared to leave the room. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`there is something to go back.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) has gone, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Bedwin. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Call after him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bedwin/Bedwin</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`it's particular. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is a poor man, and they are not paid for. There are some books to be taken back, too.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran another; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy; but there was no boy in sight.
<p/>The street-door was opened. Oliver and the girl returned, in a breathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>). `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Send Oliver with them,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div><p/>Dear me, I am very sorry for that,' exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`I particularly wished those books to be returned to-night.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out on any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) should; and that, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) prompt discharge of the commission, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) should prove to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) the injustice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) suspicions: on this head at least: at once. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` I'll run all the way, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>You shall go, my dear,' said the old gentleman. `
<p/>Oliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) arm in a great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was to take. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You are to say,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig; <div class="bookquote">`you are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have come to pay the four pound ten I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>).
<p/>This is a five-pound note, so you will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I won't be ten minutes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, eagerly.
<p/>Having buttoned up the bank-note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully under his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) made a respectful bow, and left the room.
<p/>Mrs. Bedwin followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to the street-door, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) many directions about the nearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of the street: all of which Oliver said he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) clearly understood.
<p/>Having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the old lady at length permitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to depart. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The books are on a chair by my table. Fetch them down.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Bless his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sweet face!' said the old lady, looking after him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I can't bear, somehow, to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) go out of my sight.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) turned the corner.
<p/>Let me see; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'ll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,' said Mr. Brownlow, pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) watch, and placing it on the table. `
<p/>The old lady smilingly returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) salutation, and, closing the door, went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own room. <div class="bookquote">` It will be dark by that time.'  (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig's breast, at the moment; and it was rendered stronger by his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) friend's confident smile. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh! you really expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) to come back, do you?'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Grimwig. <div class="bookquote">` Don't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling. No,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) said, smiting the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) fist, <div class="bookquote">`I do not.
<p/>The boy has a new suit of clothes on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back, a set of valuable books under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm, and a five-pound note in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll join his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) old friends the thieves, and laugh at you. If ever that boy returns to this house, sir, I'll eat my head.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chair closer to the table; and there the two friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them.
<p/>It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a bad-hearted man, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) respected friend duped and deceived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back.
<p/>It grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely discernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in silence, with the watch between them.
<p/>In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer: there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as Mr. William Sikes.
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) feet, sat a white-coated, red-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh cut on one side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) mouth, which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>CHAPTER XV SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST , THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY WERE Keep quiet, you warmint!
<p/>Whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dog's winking, or whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) feelings were so wrought upon by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for argument and consideration.
<p/>Keep quiet!'  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, suddenly breaking silence. Whatever was the cause , the effect was a kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.
<p/>Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters; but Mr. Sikes's dog, having faults of temper in common with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) teeth in one of the half-boots.
<p/>Having given in a hearty shake, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) retired, growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head. `
<p/>said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) drew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) throat cut, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) remained where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was, and growled more fiercely than before: at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) teeth, and biting at it like a wild beast.
<p/>You would, would you?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Come here, you born devil! Come here! D'ye hear?' This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) knees, began to assail the animal most furiously.
<p/>The dog jumped from right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the door suddenly opening, the dog darted out: leaving Bill Sikes with the poker and the clasp-knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Mr. Sikes, being disappointed of the dog's participation, at once transferred his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) share in the quarrel to the new comer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage. What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?'  (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, with a fierce gesture. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I didn't know, my dear, I didn't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, humbly; for the Jew was the new comer. <div class="bookquote">` Didn't know, you white-livered thief!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>growled Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Couldn't you hear the noise?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not a sound of it, as I'm a living man, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` Oh no!
<p/>You hear nothing, you don't,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>retorted Sikes with a fierce sneer. <div class="bookquote">` Sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go!
<p/>'Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as haven't half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look; <div class="bookquote">`that's why.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>I wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.' <div class="bookquote">`Why?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired the Jew with a forced smile. The Jew rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) friend.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was obviously very ill at ease, however. <div class="bookquote">` Grin away,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) with savage contempt; <div class="bookquote">`grin away.
<p/>You'll never have the laugh at me, though, unless it's behind a nightcap. I've got the upper hand over you, Fagin; and, d--me, I'll keep it.
<p/>There! If I go, you go; so take care of me.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well, well, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`I know all that; we--we--have a mutual interest, Bill,--a mutual interest.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Humph,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) thought the interest lay rather more on the Jew's side than on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Well, what have you got to say to me?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>It's rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but as I know you'll do me a good turn another time, and--' `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` It's all passed safe through the melting-pot,'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, <div class="bookquote">`and this is your share. Stow that gammon,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>interposed the robber, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Where is it? Hand over!'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, soothingly. <div class="bookquote">` Here it is!
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) breast; and untying a large knot in one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet.
<p/>All safe!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>Sikes, snatching it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained. <div class="bookquote">` This is all, is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the sovereigns</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>All,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>inquired Sikes, suspiciously. <div class="bookquote">` Don't put on an injured look at the question; you've done it many a time. Jerk the tinkler.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell. It was answered by another Jew: younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance.
<p/>The Jew, perfectly understanding the hint, retired to fill it: previously exchanging a remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyes for an instant, as if in expectation of it, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) head in reply; so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person.
<p/>Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure. It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn.
<p/>Possibly, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had observed the brief interchange of signals, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) might have thought that it boded no good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Is anybody here, Barney?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that Sikes was looking on, without raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes from the ground. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Dot a shoul,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Barney; whose words: whether they came from the heart or not: made their way through the nose. `
<p/>` inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise: which perhaps might mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nobody? Dobody but Biss Dadsy,'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>replied Barney. <div class="bookquote">` Nancy!'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sikes. ` Where? Strike me blind, if I don't honour that <div class="bookquote">`ere girl, for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) native talents.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>replied Barney. <div class="bookquote">` Send her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. `
<p/>Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining silent, and not lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) eyes from the ground, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) retired; and presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Send her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) here.'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>You are on the scent, are you, Nancy? ` inquired Sikes, proffering the glass. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, I am, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied the young lady, disposing of its contents; <div class="bookquote">`and tired enough of it I am, too.
<p/>Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew's red eye-brows, and a half closing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance.
<p/>The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters.
<p/>In about ten minutes'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) shoulders, and declared it was time to go.
<p/>Mr. Sikes, finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was walking a short part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) way himself, expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) intention of accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>); they went away together, followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) master was out of sight.
<p/>The Jew thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head out of the room door when Sikes had left it; looked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) walked up the dark passage; shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) clenched fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated himself at the table; where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.
<p/>Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) was within so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) way to the book-stall.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) got into Clerkenwell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) accidently turned down a by-street which was not exactly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) way; but not discovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) mistake until he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) had got half-way down it, and knowing it must lead in the right direction, he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) did not think it worth while to turn back; and so marched on, as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) could, with the books under his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) arm.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) ought to feel; and how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) would give for only one look at poor little Dick, who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The young brat's been ill and confined to the crib; and--'  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Ah, Nancy, dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, looking up. Oh, my dear brother!'
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) neck. `
<p/>The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>); and who had a little basket and a street-door key in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver, struggling. <div class="bookquote">` Let go of me. Who is it? What are you stopping me for?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Oh my gracious!' said the young woman, `I have found him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)!
<p/>Oh! Oliver! Oliver! Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your account! Come home, dear, come. Oh, I've found him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>With these incoherent exclamations, the young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a butcher's boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was also looking on, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't think he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had better run for the doctor.
<p/>To which, the butcher's boy: who appeared of a lounging, not to say indolent disposition: replied, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought not. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thank gracious goodness heavins, I've found him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Oh, no, no, never mind,' said the young woman, grasping Oliver's hand; <div class="bookquote">`I'm better now.
<p/>Oh, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied the young woman, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ran away, near a month ago, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) parents, who are hard-working and respectable people; and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mother's heart.'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Come home directly, you cruel boy! Come!'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Young wretch!'

<p/>I am not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, greatly alarmed. <div class="bookquote">` I don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I haven't any sister, or father and mother either.
<p/>I'm an orphan; I live at Pentonville.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Only hear him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) braves it out!'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>cried the young woman. `
<p/>Why, it's Nancy! ` exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) face for the first time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You see he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knows me!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) can't help himself. Make him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) come home, there's good people, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'ll kill his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) dear mother and father, and break my heart!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the bystanders</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What the devil's this?'  (<font color='red'><b>a man Oliver</b></font>)</div>said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with a white dog at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heels; <div class="bookquote">`young Oliver!
<p/>Come home to your poor mother, you young dog! Come home directly.'  (<font color='red'><b>a dog</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I don't belong to them. I don't know them.
<p/>Help! help!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver, struggling in the man's powerful grasp. <div class="bookquote">` Help!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>repeated the man. <div class="bookquote">` Yes; I'll help you, you young rascal!
<p/>What books are these? You've been a stealing 'em, have you? Give 'em here.'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>With these words, the man tore the volumes from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grasp, and struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the head. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That's right!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried a looker-on, from a garret-window. <div class="bookquote">` That's the only way of bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`To be sure!'  (<font color='red'><b>a carpenter</b></font>)</div>cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving look at the garret-window. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It'll do him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good!'  (<font color='red'><b>a carpenter</b></font>)</div>said the two women. <div class="bookquote">` And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall have it, too!'  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>rejoined the man, administering another blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Weak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the brutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really was the hardened little wretch he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was described to be; what could one poor child do!
<p/>Come on, you young villain! Here, Bull's-eye, mind him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>), boy! Mind him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Darkness had set in; it was a low neighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless.
<p/>In another moment he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) dared to give utterance to, unintelligible.
<p/>It was of little moment, indeed, whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for them , had they been ever so plain.
<p/>The gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat, perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them.
<p/>The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other indications of a cattle-market.
<p/>Sikes slackened his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pace when they reached this spot: the girl being quite unable to support any longer, the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked.
<p/>* * * * * CHAPTER XVI RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY Turning to Oliver, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) roughly commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to take hold of Nancy's hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do you hear?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round. They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.
<p/>Oliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>See here, boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) other hand to Oliver's throat; <div class="bookquote">`if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) speaks ever so soft a word, hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)!
<p/>Give me the other,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, seizing Oliver's unoccupied hand. <div class="bookquote">` Here, Bull's-Eye!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>The dog looked up, and growled. <div class="bookquote">` D'ye mind!'
 (<font color='red'><b>The dog</b></font>)</div><p/>The dog growled again; and licking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lips, eyed Oliver as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) were anxious to attach himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) windpipe without delay. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) isn't!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, you know what you've got to expect, master, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon stop that game.
<p/>Bull's-eye wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.
<p/>It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary.
<p/>The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger in Oliver's eyes; and making his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) uncertainty the more dismal and depressing.
<p/>Get on, young`un!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>The night was dark and foggy. They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the hour.
<p/>With its first stroke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) two conductors stopped, and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded. <div class="bookquote">` Eight o'  (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Sikes</b></font>)</div>clock, Bill,' said Nancy, when the bell ceased. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What's the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can't I!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` I wonder whether THEY can hear it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Nancy.
<p/>It was Bartlemy time when I was shopped; and there warn't a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn't hear the squeaking on.
<p/>Arter I was locked up for the night, the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Of course they can,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes. ` <div class="bookquote">`Poor fellow!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Nancy, who still had her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, Bill, such fine young chaps as them!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes; that's all you women think of,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>answered Sikes. ` Fine young chaps!
<p/>With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver's wrist more firmly, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to step out again. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Wait a minute!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the girl: <div class="bookquote">`I wouldn't hurry by, if it was you that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o'clock struck, Bill.
<p/>I'd walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow was on the ground, and I hadn't a shawl to cover me.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, they're as good as dead, so it don't much matter.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And what good would that do?' inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at all, for all the good it would do me.
<p/>Come on, and don't stand preaching there.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>The girl burst into a laugh; drew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shawl more closely round her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and they walked away.
<p/>But Oliver felt her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand tremble, and, looking up in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly white.
<p/>They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full half-hour: meeting very few people, and those appearing from their looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself.
<p/>At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of old-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) keeping on guard, stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating that it was to let: which looked as if it had hung there for many years. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>All right,'  (<font color='red'><b>guard</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about. Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell. They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few moments under a lamp.
<p/>Mr. Sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and all three were quickly inside the house.
<p/>A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised, was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened. The passage was perfectly dark.
<p/>They waited, while the person who had let them in, chained and barred the door. <div class="bookquote">` Anybody here?'  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied a voice, which Oliver thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had heard before. ` Is the old <div class="bookquote">`un here?'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>asked the robber. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>replied the voice, <div class="bookquote">`and precious down in the mouth he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) has been. Won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) be glad to see you? Oh, no!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it, seemed familiar to Oliver's ears: but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Let's have a glim,'  (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, <div class="bookquote">`or we shall go breaking our necks, or treading on the dog. Look after your legs if you do!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute, the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Stand still a moment, and I'll get you one,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>replied the voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) bore in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick.
<p/>The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away, beckoned the visitors to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) down a flight of stairs.
<p/>They crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low earthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small back-yard, were received with a shout of laughter. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, my wig, my wig!'  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded: <div class="bookquote">`here he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is! oh, cry, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is!
<p/>Oh, Fagin, look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)! Fagin, do look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)! I can't bear it; it is such a jolly game, I cant'  (<font color='red'><b>Charles Bates</b></font>)</div>bear it.
<p/>With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an ectasy of facetious joy.
<p/>Then jumping to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) snatched the cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) round and round; while the Jew, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) nightcap, made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy.
<p/>The Artful, meantime, who was of a rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business, rifled Oliver's pockets with steady assiduity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) togs, Fagin!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Charley, putting the light so close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) new jacket as nearly to set him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) on fire. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) togs! Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut! Oh, my eye, what a game!
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) books, too! Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!' <div class="bookquote">` Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, bowing with mock humility. `
<p/>The Artful shall give you another suit, my dear, for fear you should spoil that Sunday one. Why didn't you write, my dear, and say you were coming?
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed, and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) merriment. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We'd have got something warm for supper.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>Hallo, what's that? ` inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew seized the note. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That's mine, Fagin.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, no, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` Mine, Bill, mine. You shall have the books.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If that ain't mine!'  (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Bill Sikes, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hat with a determined air; <div class="bookquote">`mine and Nancy's that is; I'll take the boy back again.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver started too, though from a very different cause; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hoped that the dispute might really end in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) being taken back. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The Jew started. Come! Hand over, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` This is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired the Jew. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do you think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as gets grabbed through you?
<p/>Fair, or not fair,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>retorted Sikes, <div class="bookquote">`hand over, I tell you! Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton, give it here!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between the Jew's finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face, folded it up small, and tied it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) neckerchief. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That's for our share of the trouble,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`and not half enough, neither. You may keep the books, if you're fond of reading.
<p/>They're very pretty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces, had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; <div class="bookquote">`beautiful writing, isn't is, Oliver?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>At sight of the dismayed look with which Oliver regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more boisterous than the first. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They belong to the old gentleman,'  (<font color='red'><b>Master Bates</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, wringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands; <div class="bookquote">`to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) house, and had me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever.
<p/>If you ain't, sell 'em.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>` Oh, pray send them back; send him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) back the books and money. Keep me here all my life long; but pray, pray send them back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'ll think I stole them; the old lady: all of them who were so kind to me: will think I stole them.
<p/>With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief, Oliver fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knees at the Jew's feet; and beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands together, in perfect desperation. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, do have mercy upon me, and send them back!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>The boy's right,' remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You're right, Oliver, you're right; they WILL think you have stolen 'em. Ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>chuckled the Jew, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">`it couldn't have happened better, if we had chosen our time!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course it couldn't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes; ` I know'd that, directly I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) arm.
<p/>They're soft-hearted psalm-singers, or they wouldn't have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) in at all; and they'll ask no questions after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), fear they should be obliged to prosecute, and so get him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) lagged.
<p/>Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being spoken, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) jumped suddenly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) feet, and tore wildly from the room: uttering shrieks for help, which made the bare old house echo to the roof. `
<p/>cried Nancy, springing before the door, and closing it, as the Jew and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) two pupils darted out in pursuit. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's all right enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)'s safe enough.'  (<font color='red'><b>pupils</b></font>)</div>Keep back the dog, Bill!' Keep back the dog; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'ll tear the boy to pieces.' <div class="bookquote">`Serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) right!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from the girl's grasp. <div class="bookquote">` Stand off from me, or I'll split your head against the wall.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>I don't care for that, Bill, I don't care for that,' screamed the girl, struggling violently with the man, <div class="bookquote">`the child shan't be torn down by the dog, unless you kill me first.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man child</b></font>)</div><p/>The housebreaker flung the girl from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the further end of the room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among them. `
<p/>` <div class="bookquote">` Shan't he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) teeth. <div class="bookquote">` I'll soon do that, if you don't keep off.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>What's the matter here!'
<p/>said Fagin, looking round. <div class="bookquote">` The girl's gone mad, I think,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, savagely. <div class="bookquote">` No, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hasn't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle; <div class="bookquote">`no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) hasn't, Fagin; don't think it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Then keep quiet, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, with a threatening look. <div class="bookquote">` No, I won't do that, neither,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy, speaking very loud. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), at present.
<p/>Come! What do you think of that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>With the view of diverting the attention of the company, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) turned to Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace; <div class="bookquote">`eh?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver made no reply. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) watched the Jew's motions, and breathed quickly. <div class="bookquote">` Wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver's shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flung it into the fire, with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room. `
<p/>sneered the Jew, catching the boy by the arm. <div class="bookquote">` We'll cure you of that, my young master.'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>I won't stand by and see it done, Fagin,' cried the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) be--let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) be--or I shall put that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows before my time.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) foot violently on the floor as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) vented this threat; and with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lips compressed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands clenched, looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber:
<p/>You've got the boy, and what more would you have?--Let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had gradually worked herself. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, Nancy!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner; <div class="bookquote">`you,--you're more clever than ever to-night.
<p/>You will be the worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>There is something about a roused woman: especially if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) add to all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair; which few men like to provoke.
<p/>The Jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss Nancy's rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.
<p/>Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) invention.
<p/>As they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) resorted to more tangible arguments. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What do you mean by this?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features: which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a disorder as measles: <div class="bookquote">`what do you mean by it?
<p/>Ha! ha! my dear, you are acting beautifully.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Am I!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl. <div class="bookquote">` Take care I don't overdo it. Burn my body!
<p/>Oh, yes, I know all about it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, laughing hysterically; and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head from side to side, with a poor assumption of indifference. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, then, keep quiet,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was accustomed to use when addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) dog, <div class="bookquote">`or I'll quiet you for a good long time to come.'
 (<font color='red'><b>dog</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting a hasty look at Sikes, turned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face aside, and bit her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lip till the blood came. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You're a nice one,'  (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div>added Sikes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with a contemptuous air, <div class="bookquote">`to take up the humane and gen--teel side!
<p/>Do you know who you are, and what you are?'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` A pretty subject for the child, as you call him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), to make a friend of!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>cried the girl passionately; `and I wish I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them
<p/><div class="bookquote">` God Almighty help me, I am!'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>we passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) here.
<p/>Isn't that enough for the old wretch, without blows?' <div class="bookquote">`Come, come, Sikes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew appealing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) in a remonstratory tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all that passed; <div class="bookquote">`we must have civil words; civil words, Bill.'  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Civil words!'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'s a thief, a liar, a devil, all that's bad, from this night forth. cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Civil words, you villain! Yes, you deserve 'em from me. I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>pointing to Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve years since. Don't you know it? Speak out!
<p/>Don't you know it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well, well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; <div class="bookquote">`and, if you have, it's your living!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Aye, it is!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the words in one continuous and vehement scream. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is my living; and the cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you're the wretch that drove me to them long ago, and that'll keep me there, day and night, day and night, till I die!'
 (<font color='red'><b>scream</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I shall do you a mischief!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>interposed the Jew, goaded by these reproaches; <div class="bookquote">`a mischief worse than that, if you say much more!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair and dress in a transport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably have left signal marks of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) revenge upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), had not her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wrists been seized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made a few ineffectual struggles, and fainted. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s all right now,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) down in a corner. <div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s uncommon strong in the arms, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s up in this way.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over; but neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the boys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's the worst of having to do with women,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, replacing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) club; <div class="bookquote">`but they're clever, and we can't get on, in our line, without 'em.
<p/>Charley, show Oliver to bed.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)'d better not wear his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>inquired Charley Bates. `
<p/>Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) commission, took the cleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were two or three of the beds on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had slept before; and here, with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) produced the identical old suit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at Mr. Brownlow's; and the accidental display of which, to Fagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue received, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) whereabout. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Certainly not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which Charley put the question. Put off the smart ones,' said Charley, <div class="bookquote">`and I'll give 'em to Fagin to take care of.
<p/>Master Bates rolling up the new clothes under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the dark, and locking the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>The noise of Charley's laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who opportunely arrived to throw water over her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) friend, and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) recovery, might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which Oliver was placed.
<p/>What fun it is!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>Poor Oliver unwillingly complied. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was sick and weary; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) soon fell sound asleep. CHAPTER XVII
<p/>It is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon.
<p/>The hero sinks upon his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the next scene, his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song.
<p/>We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) virtue and her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) life alike in danger, drawing forth her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle; where a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of places, from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company, carolling perpetually.
<p/>OLIVER'S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS , BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON TO INJURE HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) REPUTATION Such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight.
<p/>The transitions in real life from well-spread boards to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are not a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of passive lookers-on, which makes a vast difference.
<p/>The actors in the mimic life of the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of mere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous.
<p/>As sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place, are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many considered as the great art of authorship: an author's skill in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) characters at the end of every chapter: this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary.
<p/>If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) is going back to the town in which Oliver Twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey, or he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition.
<p/>Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) clutched his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power.
<p/>There was an abstraction in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eye, an elevation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) air, which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle's mind, too great for utterance.
<p/>Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), deferentially, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) passed along.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) merely returned their salutations with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hand, and relaxed not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) dignified pace, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mr. Bumble always carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head high; but this morning it was higher than usual. Drat that beadle!'  (<font color='red'><b>the infant paupers</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known shaking at the garden-gate. `
<p/>If it isn't him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) at this time in the morning! Lauk, Mr. Bumble, only think of its being you! Well, dear me, it IS a pleasure, this is!
<p/>The first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of delight were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the garden-gate: and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), with great attention and respect, into the house. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mrs. Mann,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself into a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair; <div class="bookquote">`Mrs. Mann, ma'am, good morning.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Come into the parlour, sir, please.' <div class="bookquote">` Well, and good morning to you , sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Mann, with many smiles; <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>and hoping you find yourself well, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` So-so, Mrs. Mann,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle. <div class="bookquote">` A porochial life is not a bed of roses, Mrs. Mann.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Ah, that it isn't indeed, Mr. Bumble,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined the lady. And all the infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety, if they had heard it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A porochial life, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the infant paupers</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Bumble, striking the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane, <div class="bookquote">`is a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood; but all public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) hands with a look of sympathy, and sighed. `
<p/>Finding she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) had done right, Mrs. Mann sighed again: evidently to the satisfaction of the public character: who, repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) cocked hat, said, <div class="bookquote">`Mrs. Mann, I am going to London.'  (<font color='red'><b>the character</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ah! You may well sigh, Mrs. Mann!'  (<font color='red'><b>the character</b></font>)</div>said the beadle. Lauk, Mr. Bumble!' cried Mrs. Mann, starting back. <div class="bookquote">` To London, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>resumed the inflexible beadle, <div class="bookquote">`by coach.
<p/>A legal action is a coming on, about a settlement; and the board has appointed me--me, Mrs. Mann--to dispose to the matter before the quarter-sessions at Clerkinwell.
<p/>And I very much question,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up, <div class="bookquote">`whether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble; <div class="bookquote">`and if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have only themselves to thank.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs. Mann appeared quite awed by them.
<p/>I and two paupers, Mrs. Mann! Oh! you mustn't be too hard upon them, sir,' said Mrs. Mann, coaxingly. ` At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`You're going by coach, sir?
<p/>I thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` That's when they're ill, Mrs. Mann,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said the beadle. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their taking cold.'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They are both in a very low state, and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move 'em than to bury 'em--that is, if we can throw 'em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to do, if they don't die upon the road to spite us.
<p/>The opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` Ha! ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes again encountered the cocked hat; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) became grave. `
<p/>Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) pocket-book; and requested a receipt: which Mrs. Mann wrote. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We are forgetting business, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said the beadle; <div class="bookquote">`here is your porochial stipend for the month.'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>It's very much blotted, sir,' said the farmer of infants; <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>but it's formal enough, I dare say. Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much obliged to you, I'm sure.'
 (<font color='red'><b>infants</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann's curtsey; and inquired how the children were. <div class="bookquote">` Bless their dear little hearts!'  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann with emotion, <div class="bookquote">`they're as well as can be, the dears!
<p/>Of course, except the two that died last week. And little Dick.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Isn't that boy no better?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Bumble. Mrs. Mann shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)'s a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble angrily. <div class="bookquote">` Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I'll bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) to you in one minute, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Mann. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Having had his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) face put under the pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann's gown, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was led into the awful presence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.
<p/>Here, you Dick!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>After some calling, Dick was discovered. The child was pale and thin; his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) cheeks were sunken; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) eyes large and bright.
<p/>The scanty parish dress, the livery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) misery, hung loosely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) feeble body; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) young limbs had wasted away, like those of an old man.
<p/>Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble's glance; not daring to lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes from the floor; and dreading even to hear the beadle's voice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Can't you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann. The child meekly raised his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What's the matter with you, porochial Dick?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Bumble, with well-timed jocularity. <div class="bookquote">` Nothing, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied the child faintly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I should think not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very much at Mr. Bumble's humour. <div class="bookquote">` You want for nothing, I'm sure.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` I should like--'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>faltered the child. <div class="bookquote">` Hey-day!'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>interposed Mr. Mann, <div class="bookquote">`I suppose you're going to say that you DO want for something, now?
<p/>Like what, sir, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I should like,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>faltered the child, <div class="bookquote">`if somebody that can write, would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and seal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why, what does the boy mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression:
<p/>Why, you little wretch--' <div class="bookquote">`Stop, Mrs. Mann, stop!'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) hand with a show of authority. ` accustomed as he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) was to such things. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What do you mean, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I should like,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child, <div class="bookquote">`to leave my dear love to poor Oliver Twist; and to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) know how often I have sat by myself and cried to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>).
<p/>And I should like to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) small hands together, and speaking with great fervour, <div class="bookquote">`that I was glad to die when I was very young
<p/>; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man, and had grown old, my little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me, or be unlike me; and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with indescribable astonishment; and, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) companion, said, <div class="bookquote">`They're all in one story, Mrs. Mann.
<p/>That out-dacious Oliver had demogalized them all!'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I couldn't have believed it, sir'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Mann, holding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) hands, and looking malignantly at Dick. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I never see such a hardened little wretch!'  (<font color='red'><b>Dick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Take him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) away, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble imperiously. ` This must be stated to the board, Mrs. Mann. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I hope the gentleman will understand that it isn't my fault, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically. <div class="bookquote">` They shall understand that, ma'am; they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mann</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There; take him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) away, I can't bear the sight on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>Dick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar.
<p/>At six o'clock next morning, Mr. Bumble: having exchanged his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked hat for a round one, and encased his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) person in a blue great-coat with a cape to it: took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course of time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) arrived in London.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in shivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble declared, caused his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) teeth to chatter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) feel quite uncomfortable; although he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had a great-coat on.
<p/>Having disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a temperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter.
<p/>Putting a glass of hot gin-and-water on the chimney-piece, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) chair to the fire; and, with sundry moral reflections on the too-prevalent sin of discontent and complaining, composed himself to read the paper.
<p/>Mr. Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) journey. The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble's eye rested, was the following advertisement. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Whereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on Thursday evening last, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) home, at Pentonville; and has not since been heard of.
<p/>The above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver Twist, or tend to throw any light upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) previous history, in which the advertiser is, for many reasons, warmly interested.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>And then followed a full description of Oliver's dress, person, appearance, and disappearance: with the name and address of Mr. Brownlow at full length.
<p/>Mr. Bumble opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and carefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) way to Pentonville: having actually, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) excitement, left the glass of hot gin-and-water, untasted. `
<p/>To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive reply of <div class="bookquote">`I don't know; where do you come from?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver's name, in explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) errand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door, hastened into the passage in a breathless state. `
<p/>FIVE GUINEAS REWARD <div class="bookquote">` Is Mr. Brownlow at home?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened the door. Come in, come in,' said the old lady: <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I knew we should hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>). Poor dear! I knew we should! I was certain of it. Bless his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) heart!
<p/>Having heard this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again; and seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears.
<p/>The girl, who was not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now returned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) immediately: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) did.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) friend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them.
<p/>I said so all along.'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>The latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation: <div class="bookquote">` A beadle. A parish beadle, or I'll eat my head.'
 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman beadle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Pray don't interrupt just now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">` Take a seat, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr. Grimwig's manner.
<p/>Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp, so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadle's countenance; and said, with a little impatience, <div class="bookquote">`Now, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement?'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` And you ARE a beadle, are you not?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Grimwig. <div class="bookquote">` I am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly. `
<p/>Mr. Brownlow gently shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) head to impose silence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) friend, and resumed: <div class="bookquote">`Do you know where this poor boy is now?'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) friend, <div class="bookquote">`I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) was. A beadle all over!'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>No more than nobody,' replied Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, what DO you know of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` Speak out, my friend, if you have anything to say.
<p/>You don't happen to know any good of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), do you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Grimwig, caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble's features.
<p/>What DO you know of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>)?' ` Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head with portentous solemnity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble's pursed-up countenance; and requested him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) to communicate what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) knew regarding Oliver, in as few words as possible.
<p/>Mr. Bumble put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat; unbuttoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) coat; folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) arms; inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>reflection, commenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) story.
<p/>It would be tedious if given in the beadle's words: occupying, as it did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents.
<p/>You see?' said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) birth, displayed no better qualities than treachery, ingratitude, and malice.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had terminated his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) brief career in the place of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night-time from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) master's house.
<p/>In proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) really being the person he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had brought to town.
<p/>Folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) arms again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) then awaited Mr. Brownlow's observations. <div class="bookquote">` I fear it is all too true,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after looking over the papers. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This is not much for your intelligence; but I would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been favourable to the boy.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this information at an earlier period of the interview, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) might have imparted a very different colouring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) little history.
<p/>It was too late to do it now, however; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head gravely, and, pocketing the five guineas, withdrew.
<p/>Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so much disturbed by the beadle's tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to vex him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) further.
<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) stopped, and rang the bell violently. <div class="bookquote">` Mrs. Bedwin,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; <div class="bookquote">`that boy, Oliver, is an imposter.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` It can't be, sir. It cannot be,'  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>said the old lady energetically. <div class="bookquote">` I tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>retorted the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We have just heard a full account of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) birth; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) has been a thorough-paced little villain, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) life.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>What do you mean by can't be? <div class="bookquote">` I never will believe it, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the old lady, firmly. <div class="bookquote">` Never!'

<p/>Why didn't you take my advise in the beginning; you would if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) hadn't had a fever, I suppose, eh? He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) was interesting, wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)?
<p/>Interesting! Bah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR.

<p/>I know what children are, sir; and have done these forty years; and people who can't say the same, shouldn't say anything about them.
<p/>As it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, and smoothed down her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) apron preparatory to another speech, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was stopped by Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That's my opinion!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor.

<p/>Never let me hear the boy's name again. I rang to tell you that. Never. Never, on any pretence, mind! You may leave the room, Mrs. Bedwin.
<p/>when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) good friends; it was well for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not know what they had heard, or it might have broken outright.
<p/>Remember! I am in earnest.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow's that night. Oliver's heart sank within him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), CHAPTER XVIII
<p/>when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) clearly demonstrated he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been guilty, to no ordinary extent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) anxious friends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) recovery.
<p/>Mr. Fagin laid great stress on the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) having taken Oliver in, and cherished him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), when, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) timely aid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) might have perished with hunger; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) philanthropy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had succoured under parallel circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be hanged at the Old Bailey one morning.
<p/>Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question, had rendered it necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not precisely true, was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) -LRB-Mr. Fagin-RRB- and a few select friends.
<p/>Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with great friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) anxious hopes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant operation.
<p/>Little Oliver's blood ran cold, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) listened to the Jew's words, and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them.
<p/>That it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knew already; and that deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or over-communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by the Jew on more occasions than one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) thought by no means unlikely, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) glanced timidly up, and met the Jew's searching look, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman.
<p/>The Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) saw they would be very good friends yet.
<p/>Then, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hat, and covering himself with an old patched great-coat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) went out, and locked the room-door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and left during the long hours to commune with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own thoughts.
<p/>Which, never failing to revert to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) kind friends, and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), were sad indeed.
<p/>After the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door unlocked; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was at liberty to wander about the house.
<p/>HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) REPUTABLE FRIENDS About noon next day, It was a very dirty place.
<p/>The rooms upstairs had great high wooden chimney-pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the ceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were ornamented in various ways.
<p/>From all of these tokens Oliver concluded that a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to better people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome: dismal and dreary as it looked now.
<p/>Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings; and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would scamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes.
<p/>With these exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing; and often, when it grew dark, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was tired of wandering from room to room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would crouch in the corner of the passage by the street-door, to be as near living people as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could; and would remain there, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys returned.
<p/>In all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed: the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which was admitted, stealing its way through round holes at the top: which made the rooms more gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows.
<p/>There was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no shutter; and out of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends.
<p/>Sometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the parapet-wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again; and as the window of Oliver's observatory was nailed down, and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond, without making any attempt to be seen or heard,--which
<p/>One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that evening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) person -LRB-to do him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) justice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)-RRB-; and, with this end and aim, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) toilet, straightway.
<p/>Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those about him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the way of this proposal.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) at once expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) readiness; and, kneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) could take his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) foot in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) laps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) applied himself to a process which Mr. Dawkins designated as <div class="bookquote">`japanning his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) trotter-cases.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dawkins/Mr. John Dawkins/John</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) had as much chance of being, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) had lived inside the ball of St. Paul's Cathedral. The phrase, rendered into plain English, signifieth, cleaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) boots.
<p/>Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and having his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of having taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to disturb his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer that mollified his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) thoughts; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) was evidently tinctured, for the nonce, with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) general nature.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief space; and then, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head, and heaving a gentle sign, said, half in abstraction, and half to Master Bates: <div class="bookquote">`What a pity it is he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) isn't a prig!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Master Charles Bates; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) don't know what's good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>Master Charles Bates</b></font>)</div>The Dodger sighed again, and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) pipe: as did Charley Bates.
<p/>They both smoked, for some seconds, in silence. <div class="bookquote">` I suppose you don't even know what a prig is?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger mournfully. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I think I know that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, looking up. <div class="bookquote">` It's a the--; you're one, are you not?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver, checking himself. `
<p/>Mr. Dawkins gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this sentiment, and looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) would feel obliged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) saying anything to the contrary. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">` I'd scorn to be anything else.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>I am,' repeated the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">` So's Charley. So's Fagin.
<p/>So's Sikes. So's Nancy. So's Bet. So we all are, down to the dog. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s the downiest one of the lot!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) wouldn't so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of committing himself; no, not if you tied him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) up in one, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) there without wittles for a fortnight,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And the least given to peaching,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>added Charley Bates. <div class="bookquote">` Not a bit of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>observed Charley. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)'s a rum dog.
<p/>Don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)'s in company!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>pursued the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">` Won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) growl at all, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hears a fiddle playing!
<p/>And don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hate other dogs as ain't of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) breed! Oh, no!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>)'s an out-and-out Christian,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley. This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal's abilities, but it was an appropriate remark in another sense,
<p/>if Master Bates had only known it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to be out-and-out Christians, between whom, and
<p/>Well, well,' said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they had strayed: with that mindfulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) profession which influenced all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) proceedings. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mr. Sikes'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>dog, there exist strong and singular points of resemblance. <div class="bookquote">` This hasn't go anything to do with young Green here.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes dog</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` No more it has,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said Charley. <div class="bookquote">` Why don't you put yourself under Fagin, Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And make your fortun'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>out of hand?' added the Dodger, with a grin. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen-teel: as I mean to, in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes, and the forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said Charley Bates.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` I don't like it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>rejoined Oliver, timidly; <div class="bookquote">` I wish they would let me go. I--I--would rather go.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And Fagin would RATHER not!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>rejoined Charley.
<p/>Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feelings more openly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) only sighed, and went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) boot-cleaning. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Go!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">` Why, where's your spirit?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>Don't you take any pride out of yourself? Would you go and be dependent on your friends?'
<p/>Oh, blow that!' said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard, <div class="bookquote">`that's too mean; that is.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>You can leave your friends, though,' said Oliver with a half smile; <div class="bookquote">`and let them be punished for what you did.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>That,' rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) pipe, <div class="bookquote">`That was all out of consideration for Fagin, 'cause the traps know that we work together, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) might have got into trouble if we hadn't made our lucky; that was the move, wasn't it, Charley?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection of Oliver's flight came so suddenly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), that the smoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was inhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head, and down into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping, about five minutes long. `
<p/>` <div class="bookquote">` I couldn't do it,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust. ` <div class="bookquote">` Look here!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Here's a jolly life! What's the odds where it comes from? Here, catch hold; there's plenty more where they were took from.
<p/>You won't, won't you? Oh, you precious flat!'  (<font color='red'><b>a handful</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` It's naughty, ain't it, Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>inquired Charley Bates. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)'ll come to be scragged, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) said it, Master Bates caught up an end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) neckerchief; and, holding it erect in the air, dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) shoulder, and jerked a curious sound through his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic representation, that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`I don't know what that means,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Something in this way, old feller,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Charly. That's what it means,' said Charley. `
<p/>Look how he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) stares, Jack! I never did see such prime company as that <div class="bookquote">`ere boy; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll be the death of me,
<p/>I know he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily again, resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) pipe with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">` You've been brought up bad,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger, surveying his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) boots with much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You'd better begin at once; for you'll come to the trade long before you think of it; and you're only losing time, Oliver.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own: which, being exhausted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) friend Mr. Dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the best thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could do, would be to secure Fagin's favour without more delay, by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And always put this in your pipe, Nolly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger, as the Jew was heard unlocking the door above, <div class="bookquote">`if you don't take fogels and tickers--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Fagin will make something of you, though, or you'll be the first he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) ever had that turned out unprofitable. What's the good of talking in that way?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>interposed Master Bates; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) don't know what you mean.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If you don't take pocket-handkechers and watches,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger, reducing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) conversation to the level of Oliver's capacity, <div class="bookquote">`some other cove will; so that the coves that lose 'em will be all the worse, and you'll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha`p`orth the better, except the chaps wot gets them--and you've just as good a right to them as they have.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>To be sure, to be sure!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, who had entered unseen by Oliver. ` It all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the Dodger's word for it.
<p/>The old man rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands gleefully together, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) corroborated the Dodger's reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) pupil's proficiency.
<p/>The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver had never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom Chitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady, now made his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) appearance.
<p/>Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) had small twinkling eyes, and a pock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy fustian trousers, and an apron.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) wardrobe was, in truth, rather out of repair; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) excused himself to the company by stating that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">`time'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) had not been able to bestow any attention on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) private clothes.
<p/>Mr. Chitling added, with strong marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there was no remedy against the County.
<p/>The same remark he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) held to be decidedly unlawful.
<p/>Mr. Chitling wound up his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) observations by stating that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long hard-working days; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">`wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) might be busted if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) warn't as dry as a lime-basket.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?' inquired the Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ha! ha! ha! He (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) understands the catechism of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) trade.'  (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I--I--don't know, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Who's that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A young friend of mine, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)'s in luck, then,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin. `
<p/>Never mind where I came from, young <div class="bookquote">`un; you'll find your way there, soon enough, I'll bet a crown!'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>At this sally, the boys laughed.
<p/>After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and sit by him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hearers.
<p/>These were, the great advantages of the trade, the proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the liberality of the Jew himself.
<p/>At length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr. Chitling did the same: for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two.
<p/>After some more jokes on the same subject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew. Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew; and left the party to their repose.
<p/>From this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with the Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver's, Mr. Fagin best knew.
<p/>At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had committed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) younger days: mixed up with so much that was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing heartily, and showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was amused in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) better feelings.
<p/>Having prepared his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the companionship of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was now slowly instilling into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) soul the poison which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hoped would blacken it, and change its hue for ever.
<p/>In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) toils. CHAPTER XIX IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON
<p/>It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) great-coat tight round his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) face: emerged from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) den.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>); and having listened while the boys made all secure, and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down the street as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) could.
<p/>The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck off in the direction of the Spitalfields.
<p/>The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch.
<p/>The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of Whitechapel. It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of some rich offal for a meal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and densely-populated quarter.
<p/>The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) traversed to be at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the intricacies of the way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hurried through several alleys and streets, and at length turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end.
<p/>At the door of a house in this street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) knocked; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) walked upstairs.
<p/>A dog growled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) touched the handle of a room-door; and a man's voice demanded who was there. <div class="bookquote">` Only me, Bill; only me, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said the Jew looking in. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bring in your body then,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Lie down, you stupid brute! Don't you know the devil when he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'s got a great-coat on?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin's outer garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) retired to the corner from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had risen: wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) tail as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) went, to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was as well satisfied as it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) nature to be. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) young friend had not met, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had interfered in behalf of Oliver.
<p/>Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Well, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew.--`Ah! Nancy.' All doubts upon the subject, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had any, were speedily removed by the young lady's behaviour.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feet off the fender, pushed back her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair, and bade Fagin draw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), without saying more about it: for it was a cold night, and no mistake. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is cold, Nancy dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) warmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) skinny hands over the fire. <div class="bookquote">` It seems to go right through one,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added the old man, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) something to drink, Nancy.
<p/>It's enough to turn a man ill, to see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lean old carcase shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were many: which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were filled with several kinds of liquids.
<p/>Burn my body, make haste! Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy, bade the Jew drink it off. <div class="bookquote">` Quite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, putting down the glass after just setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) lips to it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What! You're afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes on the Jew. `
<p/>With a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) did at once.
<p/>The Jew glanced round the room, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) companion tossed down the second glassful; not in curiousity, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had seen it often before; but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>).
<p/>It was a meanly furnished apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a <div class="bookquote">`life-preserver'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>that hung over the chimney-piece. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ugh!'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>There,' said Sikes, smacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">` Now I'm ready.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`For business?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` For business,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>so say what you've got to say.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>` About the crib at Chertsey, Bill? ` said the Jew, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) chair forward, and speaking in a very low voice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes. Wot about it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Ah! you know what I mean , my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) knows what I mean, Nancy; don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>Speak out, and call things by their right names; don't sit there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you warn't the very first that thought about the robbery.
<p/>Wot d'ye mean?' <div class="bookquote">`Hush, Bill, hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation; `somebody will hear us, my dear.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) don't,'  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>sneered Mr. Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Or he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) won't, and that's the same thing. Somebody will hear us.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>But as Mr. Sikes DID care, on reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) voice as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) said the words, and grew calmer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Let 'em hear!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`I don't care.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>There, there,' said the Jew, coaxingly. <div class="bookquote">` It was only my caution, nothing more.
<p/>Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to be done, Bill, eh? When is it to be done?
<p/>Such plate, my dear, such plate!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew: rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands, and elevating his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Not at all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes coldly. <div class="bookquote">` Not to be done at all!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>echoed the Jew, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No, not at all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` At least it can't be a put-up job, as we expected.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Then it hasn't been properly gone about,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, turning pale with anger. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) can't get one of the servants in line.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>Don't tell me!' <div class="bookquote">` But I will tell you,'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>retorted Sikes. ` Who are you that's not to be told? <div class="bookquote">`Do you mean to tell me, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew: softening as the other grew
<p/>heated: <div class="bookquote">`that neither of the two men in the house can be got over?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, I do mean to tell you so,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The old lady has had 'em these twenty years; and if you were to give 'em five hundred pound, they wouldn't be in it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But do you mean to say, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>remonstrated the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`that the women can't be got over?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Not a bit of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Not by flash Toby Crackit?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said the Jew incredulously. <div class="bookquote">` Think what women are, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No; not even by flash
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'s worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'s been loitering down there, and it's all of no use.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Toby Crackit,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said the Jew. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) did,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sikes, <div class="bookquote">`and they warn't of no more use than the other plant.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>The Jew looked blank at this information.
<p/>After ruminating for some minutes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) chin sunk on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) breast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head and said, with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) feared the game was up. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And yet,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the old man, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, <div class="bookquote">`it's a sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal.
<p/>Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had been deaf to all that passed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed; <div class="bookquote">`is it worth fifty shiners extra, if it's safely done from the outside?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>`
<p/><div class="bookquote">` So it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Worse luck!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>Sikes eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) furtively from time to time. Yes,' said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, my dear, yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>rejoined the Jew; his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes glistening, and every muscle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Is it a bargain?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Then,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew's hand, with some disdain, <div class="bookquote">`let it come off as soon as you like.
<p/>Toby and me were over the garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and shutters. The crib's barred up at night like a jail; but there's one part we can crack, safe and softly.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Which is that, Bill?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>asked the Jew eagerly. <div class="bookquote">` Why,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>whispered Sikes, <div class="bookquote">`as you cross the lawn--'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head forward, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes almost starting out of it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Umph!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew's face. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You can't do it without me, I know; but it's best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>Never mind which part it is. <div class="bookquote">`As you like, my dear, as you like'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` Is there no help wanted, but yours and Toby's?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>None,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Cept a centre-bit and a boy. The first we've both got; the second you must find us.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` A boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` Oh! then it's a panel, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Never mind wot it is!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes. `
<p/>I want a boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) musn't be a big <div class="bookquote">`un. Lord!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, `if I'd only got that young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper's!
<p/>But the father gets lagged; and then the Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from a trade where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was earning money, teaches him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to read and write, and in time makes a <div class="bookquote">`prentice of him (<font color='blue'><b>prentice</b></font>).
<p/>And so they go on,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) wrath rising with the recollection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) wrongs, <div class="bookquote">`so they go on; and, if they'd got money enough -LRB-which it's a Providence they haven't,-RRB- we shouldn't have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year or two.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>No more we should,' acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering during this speech, and had only caught the last sentence. `
<p/>The Jew nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) would have her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) told to leave the room.
<p/>Sikes shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) shoulders impatiently, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) thought the precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting Miss Nancy to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) a jug of beer. `
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) small on purpose, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) out by the job. <div class="bookquote">` Bill!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What now?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes. You don't want any beer,' said Nancy, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) arms, and retaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) seat very composedly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I tell you I do!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Nonsense,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl coolly, <div class="bookquote">`Go on, Fagin. I know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'s going to say, Bill; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) needn't mind me.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew still hesitated. Sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise. <div class="bookquote">` Why, you don't mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) asked at length. <div class="bookquote">` You've known her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) long enough to trust her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), or the Devil's in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ain't one to blab.
<p/>Are you Nancy?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I should think not!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the young lady: drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair up to the table, and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) elbows upon it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No, no, my dear, I know you're not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the Jew; <div class="bookquote">`but--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>and again the old man paused. <div class="bookquote">` But wot?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I didn't know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mightn't p`r`aps be out of sorts, you know, my dear, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was the other night,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew.
<p/>At this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing a glass of brandy, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) head with an air of defiance, and burst into sundry exclamations of <div class="bookquote">`Keep the game a-going!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/>These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head with a satisfied air, and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Never say die!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the like. Now, Fagin,' said Nancy with a laugh. <div class="bookquote">` Tell Bill at once, about Oliver!'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>you're a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, patting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) on the neck. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ha! It WAS about Oliver I was going to speak, sure enough. Ha! ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>demanded Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s the boy for you, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper; laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) finger on the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) nose, and grinning frightfully. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) mayn't be so much up, as any of the others; but that's not what you want, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)'s only to open a door for you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Have him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), Bill!'

(<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said the robber, poising a crowbar, which he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) had drawn from under the bedstead. <div class="bookquote">` I've thought of it all,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the Jew with energy. `
<p/>Once let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is one of us; once fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) mind with the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) has been a thief; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)'s ours!
<p/>I've-- I've had my eye upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), my dears, close--close. Ours for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) life. Oho! It couldn't have come about better!
<p/>The old man crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast; and, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy. <div class="bookquote">`

(<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Perhaps I do, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle. <div class="bookquote">`

<p/>Their looks convict 'em when they get into trouble, and I lose 'em all. With this boy, properly managed, my dears, I could do what I couldn't with twenty of them.
<p/>Besides,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) self-possession, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) has us now if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) could only give us leg-bail again; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) must be in the same boat with us.

<p/>Now, how much better this is, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way--which would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>When is it to be done?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) received Fagin's affectation of humanity. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`I planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR.

(<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`

 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` It's all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>asked the Jew. Sikes nodded. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And about--'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh, ah, it's all planned,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sikes, interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Never mind particulars. You'd better bring the boy here to-morrow night.
<p/>I shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak. Then you hold your tongue, and keep the melting-pot ready, and that's all you'll have to do.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew's next evening when the night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>); Fagin craftily observing, that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) evinced any disinclination to the task, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) behalf, than anybody else.
<p/>It was also solemnly arranged that poor Oliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes; and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) thought fit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>): it being understood that, to render the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by Mr. Sikes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash Toby Crackit.
<p/>These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner; yelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song, mingled with wild execrations.
<p/>At length, in a fit of professional enthusiasm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) insisted upon producing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) box of housebreaking tools: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had no sooner stumbled in with, and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained, and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) fell over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) fell. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Good-night, Nancy,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, muffling himself up as before. <div class="bookquote">` Good-night.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), narrowly.
<p/>There was no flinching about the girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was as true and earnest in the matter as Toby Crackit himself could be.
<p/>The Jew again bade her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back was turned, groped downstairs. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves to call up some long-forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never lasts.
<p/>Always the way!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>muttered the Jew to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) turned homeward. <div class="bookquote">` Ha! ha! The man against the child, for a bag of gold!'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) way, through mud and mire, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) gloomy abode: where the Dodger was sitting up, impatiently awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) return. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Is Oliver a-bed? I want to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) first remark as they descended the stairs. <div class="bookquote">` Hours ago,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger, throwing open a door. `
<p/>The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) prison, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Not now,' said the Jew, turning softly away. <div class="bookquote">` To-morrow. To-morrow.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XX WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR.
<p/>When Oliver awoke in the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bedside; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) old shoes had been removed.
<p/>At first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sitting down to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), in a tone and manner which increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) alarm, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was to be taken to the residence of Bill Sikes that night. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>WILLIAM SIKES To--to--stop there, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Bill/Bill Sikes</b></font>)</div>asked Oliver, anxiously. <div class="bookquote">` No, no, my dear. Not to stop there,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew. `
<p/>We shouldn't like to lose you. Don't be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us again. Ha! ha! ha! We won't be so cruel as to send you away, my dear.
<p/>The old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread, looked round as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would still be very glad to get away if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I suppose,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes on Oliver, <div class="bookquote">`you want to know what you're going to Bill's for--eh, my dear?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) did want to know. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh no, no!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Why, do you think?' inquired Fagin, parrying the question. <div class="bookquote">` Indeed I don't know, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boy's face. <div class="bookquote">` Wait till Bill tells you, then.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver's not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt very anxious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was too much confused by the earnest cunning of Fagin's looks, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own speculations, to make any further inquiries just then.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had no other opportunity: for the Jew remained very surly and silent till night: when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) prepared to go abroad. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You may burn a candle,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, putting one upon the table. <div class="bookquote">` And here's a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you.
<p/>Good-night!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Good-night!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, softly. The Jew walked to the door: looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) shoulder at the boy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) went.
<p/>Suddenly stopping, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) name. Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to light it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) did so; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) placed the candlestick upon the table, saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), with lowering and contracted brows, from the dark end of the room. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Take heed, Oliver! take heed!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the old man, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) right hand before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in a warning manner. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'s a rough man, and thinks nothing of blood when his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own is up.
<p/>Placing a strong emphasis on the last word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) suffered his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin, and, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head, left the room.
<p/>Oliver leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand when the old man disappeared, and pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had just heard.
<p/>The more he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thought of the Jew's admonition, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) to Sikes, which would not be equally well answered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) remaining with Fagin; and after meditating for a long time, concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker, until another boy, better suited for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) purpose could be engaged.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) remained lost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed the candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), began to read.
<p/>Whatever falls out, say nothing; and do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) bids you. Mind!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) turned over the leaves. Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a passage which attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) attention, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) soon became intent upon the volume.
<p/>It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals; and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use.
<p/>Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep them down, deep as they were, but had yielded them up at last, after many years, and so maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they had confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony.
<p/>Here, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night, had been tempted -LRB-so they said-RRB- and led on, by their own bad thoughts, to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs quail, to think of.
<p/>The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid, that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and the words upon them, to be sounded in his (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) ears, as if they were whispered, in hollow murmurs, by the spirits of the dead.
<p/>Then, falling upon his (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) knees, he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) prayed Heaven to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) from such deeds; and rather to will that he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) should die at once, than be reserved for crimes, so fearful and appalling.
<p/>By degrees, he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) grew more calm, and besought, in a low and broken voice, that he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) might be rescued from his (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it might come to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) now, when, desolate and deserted, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) prayer, but still remained with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head buried in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands, when a rustling noise aroused him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>In a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). What's that!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure standing by the door. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Who's there?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Me. Only me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied a tremulous voice. Oliver raised the candle above his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head: and looked towards the door.
<p/>It was Nancy. <div class="bookquote">` Put down the light,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said the girl, turning away her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">` It hurts my eyes.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>Oliver saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very pale, and gently inquired if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were ill.
<p/>The girl threw herself into a chair, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>): and wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands; but made no reply. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>God forgive me!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cried after a while, <div class="bookquote">`I never thought of this.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Has anything happened?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>asked Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Can I help you?
<p/>I will if I can. I will, indeed.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rocked herself to and fro; caught her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) throat; and, uttering a gurgling sound, gasped for breath. `
<p/>The girl beat her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet upon the ground; and, suddenly stopping, drew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shawl close round her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>): and shivered with cold.
<p/>Drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chair close to it, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat there, for a little time, without speaking; but at length she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head, and looked round. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't know what comes over me sometimes,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), affecting to busy herself in arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dress; <div class="bookquote">`it's this damp dirty room, I think.
<p/>Nancy!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver, <div class="bookquote">`What is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Oliver stirred the fire. Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?' <div class="bookquote">`Am I to go with you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>asked Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes. I have come from Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied the girl. <div class="bookquote">` You are to go with me.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>` What for? ` asked Oliver, recoiling. `
<p/>What for? ` echoed the girl, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes, and averting them again, the moment they encountered the boy's face. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh! For no harm.'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I don't believe it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver: who had watched her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) closely. <div class="bookquote">` Have it your own way,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oliver could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had some power over the girl's better feelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) compassion for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) helpless state.
<p/>But, then, the thought darted across his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mind that it was barely eleven o'clock; and that many people were still in the streets: of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) tale.
<p/>For no good, then.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>As the reflection occured to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stepped forward: and said, somewhat hastily, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was ready.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) narrowly, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke; and cast upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) guessed what had been passing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thoughts. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) companion. Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the girl, stooping over him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), and pointing to the door as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked cautiously round. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You can't help yourself. I have tried hard for you, but all to no purpose. You are hedged round and round.
<p/>If ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Struck by the energy of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) manner, Oliver looked up in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face with great surprise.
<p/>I have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and I do now,' continued the girl aloud; `for those who would have fetched you, if I had not, would have been far more rough than me.
<p/>I have promised for your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm to yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to speak the truth; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) countenance was white and agitated; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) trembled with very earnestness. <div class="bookquote">` See here!
<p/>I have borne all this for you already, as true as God sees me show it.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) neck and arms; and continued, with great rapidity: <div class="bookquote">`Remember this!
<p/>And don't let me suffer more for you, just now. If I could help you, I would; but I have not the power.
<p/>They don't mean to harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours. Hush! Every word from you is a blow for me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and, blowing out the light, drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) up the stairs.
<p/>The door was opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as quickly closed, when they had passed out.
<p/>A hackney-cabriolet was in waiting; with the same vehemence which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had exhibited in addressing Oliver, the girl pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and drew the curtains close.
<p/>Give me your hand. Make haste! Your hand!'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) horse into full speed, without the delay of an instant.
<p/>The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ear, the warnings and assurances she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had already imparted.
<p/>All was so quick and hurried, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had scarcely time to recollect where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was, or how he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to which the Jew's steps had been directed on the previous evening.
<p/>For one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street, and a cry for help hung upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lips.
<p/>But the girl's voice was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ear, beseeching him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in such tones of agony to remember her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had not the heart to utter it.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hesitated, the opportunity was gone; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was already in the house, and the door was shut. <div class="bookquote">` This way,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the girl, releasing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hold for the first time. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bill!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Hallo!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a candle. <div class="bookquote">` Oh! That's the time of day.
<p/>Come on!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>This was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty welcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes' temperament.
<p/>Nancy, appearing much gratified thereby, saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) cordially. <div class="bookquote">` Bull's-eye's gone home with Tom,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>observed Sikes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) lighted them up. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So you've got the kid,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sikes when they had all reached the room: closing the door as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'d have been in the way.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` That's right,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>rejoined Nancy. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy. <div class="bookquote">` Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) come quiet?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'm glad to hear it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; <div class="bookquote">`for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) young carcase: as would otherways have suffered for it.
<p/>Like a lamb,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>rejoined Nancy. ` Come here, young <div class="bookquote">`un; and let me read you a lectur' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>, which is as well got over at once.'
<p/>Thus addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver's cap and threw it into a corner; and then, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) by the shoulder, sat himself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, first: do you know wot this is?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes, taking up a pocket-pistol which lay on the table. Oliver replied in the affirmative. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, then, look here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>continued Sikes. ` This is powder; that <div class="bookquote">`ere's a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin' (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>.'
<p/>Oliver murmured his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) comprehension of the different bodies referred to; and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and deliberation. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said the robber, grasping Oliver's wrist, and putting the barrel so close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) temple that they touched; at which moment the boy could not repress a start; <div class="bookquote">`if you speak a word when you're out o'doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in your head without notice.
<p/>Now it's loaded,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sikes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had finished. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, I see it is, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` So, if you do make up your mind to speak without leave, say your prayers first.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase its effect, Mr. Sikes continued. <div class="bookquote">` As near as I know, there isn't anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you,
<p/>if you was disposed of; so I needn't take this devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn't for your own good.
<p/>The short and the long of what you mean,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Nancy: speaking very emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) serious attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) words: <div class="bookquote">`is, that if you're crossed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in this job you have on hand, you'll prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ever telling tales afterwards, by shooting him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) through the head, and will take your chance of swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way of business, every month of your life.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>D'ye hear me?' ` <div class="bookquote">` That's it!'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; `women can always put things in fewest words.--Except when it's blowing up; and then they lengthens it out.
<p/>In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth; disappearing for a few minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheep's heads: which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular coincidence of <div class="bookquote">`jemmies'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>being a can name, common to them, and also to an ingenious implement much used in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) profession.
<p/>Indeed, the worthy gentleman, stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service, was in great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof, it may be here remarked, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) humourously drank all the beer at a draught, and did not utter, on a rough calculation, more than four-score oaths during the whole progress of the meal.
<p/>And now that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s thoroughly up to it, let's have some supper, and get a snooze before starting.' Supper being ended--it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great appetite for it--Mr.
<p/>Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many imprecations in case of failure, to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) at five precisely.
<p/>Oliver stretched himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) clothes, by command of the same authority, on a mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before it, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time.
<p/>For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to trim the light.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) great-coat, which hung over the back of a chair.
<p/>Weary with watching and anxiety, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) at length fell asleep. Nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast. It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning, and it was quite dark outside.
<p/>A sharp rain, too, was beating against the window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy. <div class="bookquote">` Now, then!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; <div class="bookquote">`half-past five!
<p/>Oliver was not long in making his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) toilet; having taken some breakfast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was quite ready.
<p/>Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) a handkerchief to tie round his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) throat; Sikes gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) a large rough cape to button over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>Thus attired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand to the robber, who, merely pausing to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) with a menacing gesture that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had that same pistol in a side-pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) great-coat, clasped it firmly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) away.
<p/>Look sharp, or you'll get no breakfast ; for it's late as it is.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Oliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope of meeting a look from the girl.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) old seat in front of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it. CHAPTER XXI THE EXPEDITION
<p/>It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy.
<p/>There was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene: the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded, without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house-tops, and dreary streets.
<p/>There appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were noiseless and empty.
<p/>The night had been very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the kennels were overflowing. By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had fairly begun to break.
<p/>Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and then, a stage-coach, covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver bestowing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) passed, an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who, by keeping on the wrong side of the road, had endangered his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) arriving at the office, a quarter of a minute after his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) time.
<p/>The public-houses, with gas-lights burning inside, were already open. By degrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people were met with.
<p/>Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to their work; then, men and women with fish-baskets on their heads; donkey-carts laden with vegetables; chaise-carts filled with live-stock or whole carcasses of meat; milk-women with pails; an unbroken concourse of people, trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town.
<p/>As they approached the City, the noise and traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle.
<p/>It was as light as it was likely to be, till night came on again, and the busy morning of half the London population had begun.
<p/>Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square, Mr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.
<p/>The ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep, with filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above.
<p/>All the pens in the centre of the large area, and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space, were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep.
<p/>Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the whistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and plunging of the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the grunting and squeaking of pigs, the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides; the ringing of bells and roar of voices, that issued from every public-house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping and yelling; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the throng; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite confounded the senses.
<p/>Mr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), elbowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) way through the thickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nodded, twice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward, until they were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way through Hosier Lane into Holborn. `
<p/>It was market-morning. Now, young <div class="bookquote">`un!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St. Andrew's Church, `hard upon seven! you must step out.
<p/>Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) little companion's wrist; Oliver, quickening his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could.
<p/>They held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park corner, and were on their way to Kensington: when Sikes relaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pace, until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind, came up.
<p/>Seeing <div class="bookquote">`Hounslow'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>written on it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) asked the driver with as much civility as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) could assume, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) would give them a lift as far as Isleworth. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s my boy,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Your father walks rather too quick for you, don't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), my man?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Come, don't lag behind already, Lazy-legs!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Jump up,' said the man. <div class="bookquote">` Is that your boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Not a bit of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, interposing. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thus addressing Oliver, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) into the cart; and the driver, pointing to a heap of sacks, told him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) to lie down there, and rest himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)'s used to it. Here, take hold of my hand, Ned. In with you!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>As they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more and more, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) companion meant to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey.
<p/>At length, they came to a public-house called the Coach and Horses; a little way beyond which, another road appeared to run off.
<p/>Sikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand all the while; and lifting him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) down directly, bestowed a furious look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), and rapped the side-pocket with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) fist, in a significant manner. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And here, the cart stopped. Good-bye, boy,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s sulky,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) a shake; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s sulky.
<p/>A young dog! Don't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Not I!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rejoined the other, getting into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) cart. <div class="bookquote">` It's a fine day, after all.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>Sikes waited until he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) wanted, once again led him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) onward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) journey.
<p/>They turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and then, taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many large gardens and gentlemen's houses on both sides of the way, and stopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) drove away. Here against the wall of a house, Oliver saw written up in pretty large letters, <div class="bookquote">`Hampton.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>They lingered about, in the fields, for some hours.
<p/>At length they came back into the town; and, turning into an old public-house with a defaced sign-board, ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire.
<p/>The kitchen was an old, low-roofed room; with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the fire; on which were seated several rough men in smock-frocks, drinking and smoking.
<p/>They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes; and, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) young comrade sat in a corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their company.
<p/>They had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr. Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further.
<p/>Being much tired with the walk, and getting up so early, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) dozed a little at first; then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell asleep.
<p/>Rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint of ale. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It was quite dark when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was awakened by a push from Sikes. So, you're going on to Lower Halliford, are you?'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>inquired Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, I am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied the man, who seemed a little the worse--or better, as the case might be--for drinking; <div class="bookquote">`and not slow about it neither.
<p/>My horse hasn't got a load behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) going back, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had coming up in the mornin' (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) won't be long a-doing of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>demanded Sikes, pushing the ale towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) new friend. `
<p/>Here's luck to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>). Ecod! he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s a good <div class="bookquote">`un!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If you're going directly, I can,' replied the man, looking out of the pot. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Are you going to Halliford?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Going on to Shepperton,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` I'm your man, as far as I go,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied the other. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Is all paid, Becky?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, the other gentleman's paid,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl. <div class="bookquote">` I say!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the man, with tipsy gravity; <div class="bookquote">`that won't do, you know.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why not?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` You're a-going to accommodate us, and wot's to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in return?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>The stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face; having done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) seized Sikes by the hand: and declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was a real good fellow.
<p/>To which Mr. Sikes replied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was joking; as, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had been sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was.
<p/>After the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company good-night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so, and lounging out to the door, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands full, to see the party start.
<p/>Oliver and Sikes got in without any further ceremony; and the man to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) belonged, having lingered for a minute or two <div class="bookquote">`to bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) up,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) equal, mounted also.
<p/>Then, the hostler was told to give the horse his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head; and, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head being given him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) made a very unpleasant use of it: tossing it into the air with great disdain, and running into the parlour windows over the way; after performing those feats, and supporting himself for a short time on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hind-legs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) started off at great speed, and rattled out of the town right gallantly.
<p/>The horse, whose health had been drunk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) absence, was standing outside: ready harnessed to the cart. The night was very dark.
<p/>A damp mist rose from the river, and the marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields. It was piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black.
<p/>Not a word was spoken; for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) into conversation.
<p/>Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.
<p/>There was a light in the ferry-house window opposite: which streamed across the road, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves beneath it.
<p/>There was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind.
<p/>As they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven. It seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead. Sunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road.
<p/>Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped. Sikes alighted, took Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on.
<p/>They turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected; but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance.
<p/>On looking intently forward, Oliver saw that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge.
<p/>Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) young life, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) saw that they stood before a solitary house: all ruinous and decayed.
<p/>The water!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>thought Oliver, turning sick with fear. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) has brought me to this lonely place to murder me!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>There was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible.
<p/>The house was dark, dismantled: and the all appearance, uninhabited. Sikes, with Oliver's hand still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), softly approached the low porch, and raised the latch.
<p/>The door yielded to the pressure, and they passed in together. CHAPTER XXII THE BURGLARY <div class="bookquote">`Hallo!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the passage. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't make such a row,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, bolting the door. <div class="bookquote">` Show a glim, Toby.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Aha! my pal!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the same voice. `
<p/>The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at the person he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) addressed, to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) slumbers: for the noise of a wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A glim, Barney, a glim! Show the gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>Do you hear?' cried the same voice. `
<p/>There's Bill Sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>); and you sleeping there, as if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger.
<p/>A pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the room, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on the right hand; first, a feeble candle: and next, the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) nose, and officiating as waiter at the public-house on Saffron Hill. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Are you any fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly?'  (<font color='red'><b>waiter</b></font>)</div>Bister Sikes!' exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; <div class="bookquote">`cub
<p/>id, sir; cub id.'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Here! you get on first,'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Quicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Muttering a curse upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>); and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken chairs, a table, and a very old couch: on which, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) legs much higher than his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long clay pipe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with large brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring, shawl-pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches.
<p/>Mr. Crackit -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) it was-RRB- had no very great quantity of hair, either upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) head or face; but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) had, was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew curls, through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers, ornamented with large common rings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) was a trifle above the middle size, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) own admiration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) top-boots, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) contemplated, in their elevated situation, with lively satisfaction. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bill, my boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said this figure, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) head towards the door, `I'm glad to see you. I was almost afraid you'd given it up: in which case I should have made a personal wentur.
<p/>Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) eyes rested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture, and demanded who that was. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Hallo!'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>The boy. Only the boy!' replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the fire. <div class="bookquote">` Wud of Bister Fagid's lads,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Barney, with a grin. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Fagin's, eh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Wot an inwalable boy that'll make, for the old ladies'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>pockets in chapels!
<p/>There--there's enough of that,' interposed Sikes, impatiently; and stooping over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) recumbant friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) whispered a few words in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) ear: at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with a long stare of astonishment. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) seat, <div class="bookquote">`if you'll give us something to eat and drink while we're waiting, you'll put some heart in us; or in me, at all events.
<p/>Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest yourself; for you'll have to go out with us again to-night, though not very far off.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool to the fire, sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) aching head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands, scarecely knowing where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was, or what was passing around him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Here,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and a bottle upon the table, <div class="bookquote">`Success to the crack!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) rose to honour the toast; and, carefully depositing his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) empty pipe in a corner, advanced to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its contents.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) mug is a fortin' to him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>).' ` Mr. Sikes did the same. <div class="bookquote">` A drain for the boy,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Down with it, innocence.'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man's face; <div class="bookquote">`indeed, I--'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Down with it!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>echoed Toby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do you think I don't know what's good for you? Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) to drink it, Bill.'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) had better!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Burn my body, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) isn't more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers. Drink it, you perwerse imp; drink it!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing: which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes.
<p/>This done, and Sikes having satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) appetite -LRB-Oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) swallow-RRB-, the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap.
<p/>Oliver retained his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched himself on the floor: close outside the fender.
<p/>They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire.
<p/>Oliver fell into a heavy doze: imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes, or wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day: when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and declaring it was half-past one.
<p/>Sikes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great-coats; Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) hastily crammed into the pockets. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>In an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively engaged in busy preparation. Barkers for me, Barney,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Toby Crackit. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Here they are,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols. <div class="bookquote">` You loaded them yourself.'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` All right!'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>replied Toby, stowing them away. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Crape, keys, centre-bits, darkies--nothing forgotten?'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>inquired Toby: fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) coat. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The persuaders?'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I've got 'em,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` All right,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">` Bring them bits of timber, Barney. That's the time of day.'
 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) took a thick stick from Barney's hands, who, having delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on Oliver's cape. `
<p/>Oliver: who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the air, and the drink which had been forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>): put his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hand mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now then!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand. Take his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) other hand, Toby,' said Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Look out, Barney.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>The man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet.
<p/>The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them. Barney, having made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again.
<p/>The fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that, although no rain fell, Oliver's hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture that was floating about.
<p/>It was now intensely dark. They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards the lights which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had seen before. They were at no great distance off; and, as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Toby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted.
<p/>A dim light shone at intervals from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night.
<p/>Slap through the town,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>whispered Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`there'll be nobody in the way, to-night, to see us.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>But there was nobody abroad.
<p/>They had cleared the town, as the church-bell struck two. Quickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand.
<p/>After walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall: to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely pausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) under the arms; and in three or four seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) and Toby were lying on the grass on the other side.
<p/>The boy next,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>said Toby. <div class="bookquote">` Hoist him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) up; I'll catch hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>Sikes followed directly. And they stole cautiously towards the house.
<p/>And now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and terror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the objects of the expedition.
<p/>A mist came before his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ashy face; his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) limbs failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sank upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knees. `
<p/>murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pocket; <div class="bookquote">`Get up, or I'll strew your brains upon the grass.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hands together, and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror. Get up!' <div class="bookquote">` Oh! for God's sake let me go!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Oliver; `let me run away and die in the fields. I will never come near London; never, never! Oh! pray have mercy on me, and do not make me steal.
<p/>The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) grasp, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) hand upon the boy's mouth, and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) to the house. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>For the love of all the bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Hush!' cried the man; <div class="bookquote">`it won't answer here.
<p/>Say another word, and I'll do your business myself with a crack on the head. That makes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel.
<p/>Here, Bill, wrench the shutter open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'s game enough now, I'll engage. I've seen older hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold night.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin's head for sending Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little noise.
<p/>It was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the ground, at the back of the house: which belonged to a scullery, or small brewing-place, at the end of the passage.
<p/>The aperture was so small, that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of Oliver's size, nevertheless.
<p/>A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike's art, sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice; and it soon stood wide open also. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now listen, you young limb,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver's face; <div class="bookquote">`I'm a going to put you through there.
<p/>Take this light; go softly up the steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door; unfasten it, and let us in.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) had referred, swung open on its hinges. There's a bolt at the top, you won't be able to reach,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>interposed Toby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There are three there, Bill, with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on 'em: which is the old lady's arms.'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stand upon one of the hall chairs. Keep quiet, can't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, with a threatening look. <div class="bookquote">` The room-door is open, is it?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>The game of that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog, who's got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) feels wakeful.
<p/>Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) to be silent, and to get to work.
<p/>Toby complied, by first producing his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) lantern, and placing it on the ground; then by planting himself firmly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) head against the wall beneath the window, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) knees, so as to make a step of his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) back.
<p/>This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), put Oliver gently through the window with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feet first; and, without leaving hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) collar, planted him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) safely on the floor inside. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Wide,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself. ` Ha! ha! Barney <div class="bookquote">`ticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) away to-night. So neat!'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>Take this lantern,' said Sikes, looking into the room. `
<p/>Sikes, pointing to the street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) to take notice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was within shot all the way; and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) faltered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) would fall dead that instant. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You see the stairs afore you?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, <div class="bookquote">`Yes.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>It's done in a minute,' said Sikes, in the same low whisper. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Directly I leave go of you, do your work. Hark!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What's that?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>whispered the other man. They listened intently. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>In the short time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had to collect his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses, the boy had firmly resolved that, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died in the attempt or not, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family.
<p/>Nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, releasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hold of Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Now!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Filled with this idea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) advanced at once, but stealthily. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lantern fall, and knew not whether to advance or fly.
<p/>The cry was repeated--a light appeared--a vision of two terrified half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes--a flash--a loud noise--a smoke--a crash somewhere, but where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knew not,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) staggered back.
<p/>Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was up again, and had him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) by the collar before the smoke had cleared away.
<p/>Come back!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>suddenly cried Sikes aloud. <div class="bookquote">` Back! back!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) fired his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) own pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy up. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Clasp your arm tighter,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) through the window. <div class="bookquote">` Give me a shawl here. They've hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>).
<p/>Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of fire-arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace.
<p/>And then, the noises grew confused in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy's heart; and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw or heard no more.
<p/>Quick! How the boy bleeds!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXIII WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE
<p/>The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad: which, as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it savagely up in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies, scattered it in air.
<p/>Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night for the well-housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God they were at home; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) down and die.
<p/>Many hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets, at such times, who, let their crimes have been what they may, can hardly open them in a more bitter world.
<p/>Such was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) own little room, and glanced, with no small degree of complacency, at a small round table: on which stood a tray of corresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy.
<p/>MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS The night was bitter cold. In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) glanced from the table to the fireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice, her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) inward satisfaction evidently increased,--so much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>said the matron, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) elbow on the table, and looking reflectively at the fire; <div class="bookquote">`I'm sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful for!
<p/>Mrs. Corney shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) head mournfully, as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver spoon -LRB-private property-RRB- into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin tea-caddy, proceeded to make the tea.
<p/>A great deal, if we did but know it. Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds!
<p/>The black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs. Corney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney's hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Drat the pot!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>said the worthy matron, setting it down very hastily on the hob; <div class="bookquote">`a little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of cups!
<p/>What use is it of, to anybody! Except,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron thing</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Corney, pausing, <div class="bookquote">`except to a poor desolate creature like me. Oh dear!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, the matron dropped into her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) chair, and, once more resting her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) elbow on the table, thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) solitary fate.
<p/>The small teapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) mind sad recollections of Mr. Corney -LRB-who had not been dead more than five-and-twenty years-RRB-; and she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) was overpowered. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I shall never get another!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; <div class="bookquote">`I shall never get another--like him (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>Whether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is uncertain.
<p/>It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) spoke; and took it up afterwards. She (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) had just tasted her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) first cup, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) was disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, come in with you!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Corney, sharply. <div class="bookquote">` Some of the old women dying, I suppose. They always die when I'm at meals.
<p/>Don't stand there, letting the cold air in, don't. What's amiss now, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Nothing, ma'am, nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>replied a man's voice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Dear me!'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, <div class="bookquote">`is that Mr. Bumble?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`At your service, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping outside to rub his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) coat; and who now made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors.
<p/>Shall I shut the door, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold himself, shut it without permission. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very blessed afternoon; and yet them
<p/>Hard weather, Mr. Bumble,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said the matron. <div class="bookquote">` Hard, indeed, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>replied the beadle. <div class="bookquote">` Anti-porochial weather this, ma'am. paupers are not contented.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/>`Of course not. When would they be, Mr. Bumble? ` said the matron, sipping her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) tea. <div class="bookquote">` When, indeed, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why here's one man that, in consideration of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and large family, has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese, full weight.
<p/>Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grateful, ma'am? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grateful? Not a copper farthing's worth of it! What does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do, ma'am, but ask for a few coals; if it's only a pocket handkerchief full, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says!
<p/>That's the way with these people, ma'am; give 'em a apron full of coals to-day, and they'll come back for another, the day after to-morrow, as brazen as alabaster.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Coals! What would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do with coals? Toast his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheese with 'em and then come back for more. The matron expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) entire concurrence in this intelligible simile; and the beadle went on. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The day afore yesterday, a man--you have been a married woman, ma'am, and I may mention it to you--a man, with hardly a rag upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back
<p/>-LRB-here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor-RRB-, goes to our overseer's door when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has got company coming to dinner; and says, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be relieved, Mrs. Corney.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't go away, and shocked the company very much, our overseer sent him (<font color='blue'><b>overseer</b></font>) out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal.
<p/>I never,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, <div class="bookquote">`see anything like the pitch it's got to. '' My heart!'' says the ungrateful villain, ``what's the use of this to me?
<p/>You might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles!'' ``Very good,'' says our overseer, taking 'em away again, ``you won't get anything else here.
<p/>'' '' Then I'll die in the streets!'' says the vagrant. '' Oh no, you won't,'' says our overseer.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Ha!
<p/>ha! That was very good! So like Mr. Grannett, wasn't it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>interposed the matron. <div class="bookquote">` Well, Mr. Bumble?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>rejoined the beadle, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) went away; and he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) did die in the streets.
<p/>There's a obstinate pauper for you!'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` It beats anything I could have believed,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>observed the matron emphatically. <div class="bookquote">` But don't you think out-of-door relief a very bad thing, any way, Mr. Bumble?
<p/>Mrs. Corney,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information, <div class="bookquote">`out-of-door relief, properly managed: properly managed, ma'am: is the porochial safeguard.
<p/>The great principle of out-of-door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what they don't want; and then they get tired of coming.'  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You're a gentleman of experience, and ought to know. Come.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Dear me!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Corney. <div class="bookquote">` Well, that is a good one, too!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div><p/>Betwixt you and me, ma'am,' returned Mr. Bumble, <div class="bookquote">`that's the great principle; and that's the reason why, if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers, you'll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese.
<p/>But, however,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said the beadle, stopping to unpack his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) bundle, <div class="bookquote">`these are official secrets, ma'am; not to be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the porochial officers, such as ourselves.
<p/>This is the port wine, ma'am, that the board ordered for the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine port wine; only out of the cask this forenoon; clear as a bell, and no sediment!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle secrets</b></font>)</div><p/>Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to test its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it carefully in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) pocket; and took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat, as if to go. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Yes. That's the rule now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country. You'll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said the matron. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was moving towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to bidding her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) good-night, bashfully inquired whether--whether he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) wouldn't take a cup of tea?
<p/>Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) collar again; laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table.
<p/>It blows, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) coat-collar, <div class="bookquote">`enough to cut one's ears off.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) slowly seated himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) looked at the lady.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes upon the little teapot. Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled. Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) sat down, her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle; she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) tea.
<p/>Again Mr. Bumble coughed--louder this time than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had coughed yet. <div class="bookquote">` Sweet? Mr. Bumble?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>inquired the matron, taking up the sugar-basin. `
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes on Mrs. Corney as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr. Bumble was that beadle at that moment.
<p/>Mr. Bumble, having spread a handkerchief over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these amusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had no injurious effect upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) appetite, but, on the contrary, rather seemed to facilitate his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) operations in the tea and toast department. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You have a cat, ma'am, I see,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who, in the centre of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) family, was basking before the fire; <div class="bookquote">`and kittens too, I declare!'
 (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div><p/>Very sweet, indeed, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble. The tea was made, and handed in silence. <div class="bookquote">` I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can't think,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>replied the matron. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They're so happy, so frolicsome, and so cheerful, that they are quite companions for me.'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Very nice animals, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; <div class="bookquote">`so very domestic.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, yes!' rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; <div class="bookquote">`so fond of their home too, that it's quite a pleasure, I'm sure.'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mrs. Corney, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) teaspoon, <div class="bookquote">`I mean to say this, ma'am; that any cat, or kitten, that could live with you, ma'am, and not be fond of its home, must be a ass, ma'am.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>It's of no use disguising facts, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) doubly impressive; <div class="bookquote">`I would drown it myself, with pleasure.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Then you're a cruel man,' said the matron vivaciously, as she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) hand for the beadle's cup; <div class="bookquote">`and a very hard-hearted man besides.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble resigned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney's little finger as she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) laced waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) chair a very little morsel farther from the fire.
<p/>It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance between himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great heroism on Mr. Bumble's part: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) being in some sort tempted by time, place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings, which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other great public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle: who -LRB-as is well known-RRB- should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all.
<p/>Whatever were Mr. Bumble's intentions, however -LRB-and no doubt they were of the best-RRB-: it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble, moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle, brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was seated.
<p/>` <div class="bookquote">` Oh, Mr. Bumble!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>remonstrated Mrs. Corney. ` ` <div class="bookquote">` Hard-hearted, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` Hard?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>Indeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble stopped.
<p/>Now, if the matron had moved her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) chair to the right, she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) would have been scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) must have fallen into Mr. Bumble's arms; so -LRB-being a discreet matron, and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance-RRB-
<p/>Hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?' said Mr. Bumble, stirring his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) tea, and looking up into the matron's face; <div class="bookquote">`are you hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) remained where she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) was, and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea. ` <div class="bookquote">` Dear me!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the matron, `what a very curious question from a single man.
<p/>The beadle drank his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast; whisked the crumbs off his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) knees; wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) lips; and deliberately kissed the matron. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mr. Bumble!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was so great, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had quite lost her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">`Mr. Bumble, I shall scream!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?' Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) arm round the matron's waist.
<p/>As the lady had stated her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) intention of screaming, of course she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door: which was no sooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine bottles, and began dusting them with great violence: while the matron sharply demanded who was there.
<p/>It is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear, that her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) voice had quite recovered all its official asperity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If you please, mistress,'  (<font color='red'><b>a pauper</b></font>)</div>said a withered old female pauper, hideously ugly: putting her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) head in at the door, <div class="bookquote">`Old Sally is a-going fast.'
 (<font color='red'><b>a pauper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Well, what's that to me?'  (<font color='red'><b>a pauper</b></font>)</div>angrily demanded the matron. <div class="bookquote">` I can't keep her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) alive, can I?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, no, mistress,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the old woman, <div class="bookquote">`nobody can; she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s far beyond the reach of help.
<p/>I've seen a many people die; little babes and great strong men; and I know when death's a-coming, well enough. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s troubled in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) mind: and when the fits are not on her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>),--and
<p/>that's not often, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is dying very hard,--she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) has got something to tell, which you must hear. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'ll never die quiet till you come, mistress.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>At this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who couldn't even die without purposely annoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) came back, lest anything particular should occur.
<p/>Bidding the messenger walk fast, and not be all night hobbling up the stairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) from the room with a very ill grace, scolding all the way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) opened the closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugar-tongs, closely inspected a silver milk-pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal, and, having satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) curiosity on these points, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked hat corner-wise, and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table.
<p/>Having gone through this very extraordinary performance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) took off the cocked hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) back towards it, seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture.
<p/>Mr. Bumble's conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable. CHAPTER XXIV TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT. BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND MAY BE FOUND OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) body was bent by age; her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) limbs trembled with palsy; her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature's hand.
<p/>It was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the matron's room. Alas! How few of Nature's faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty!
<p/>The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of the world, change them as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions sleep, and have lost their hold for ever, that the troubled clouds pass off, and leave Heaven's surface clear.
<p/>It is a common thing for the countenances of the dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to subside into the long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy, and settle into the very look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they grow again, that those who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by the coffin's side in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth.
<p/>The old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs, muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her (<font color='blue'><b>crone</b></font>) companion; being at length compelled to pause for breath, she (<font color='blue'><b>crone</b></font>) gave the light into her (<font color='blue'><b>crone</b></font>) hand, and remained behind to follow as she (<font color='blue'><b>crone</b></font>) might: while the more nimble superior made her (<font color='blue'><b>crone</b></font>) way to the room where the sick woman lay.
<p/>There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish apothecary's apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick out of a quill. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It was a bare garret-room, with a dim light burning at the farther end. Cold night, Mrs. Corney,'  (<font color='red'><b>the apothecary</b></font>)</div>said this young gentleman, as the matron entered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Very cold, indeed, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>replied the mistress, in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) most civil tones, and dropping a curtsey as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You should get better coals out of your contractors,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the apothecary's deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker; <div class="bookquote">`these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.'  (<font color='red'><b>apothecary deputy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They're the board's choosing, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>apothecary deputy</b></font>)</div>returned the matron. <div class="bookquote">` The least they could do, would be to keep us pretty warm: for our places are hard enough.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh!' said the young mag, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) face towards the bed, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) had previously quite forgotten the patient, <div class="bookquote">`it's all U.P. there, Mrs. Corney.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the patient</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman. ` <div class="bookquote">` It is, is it, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>asked the matron. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the apothecary's apprentice, intent upon the toothpick's point. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's a break-up of the system altogether. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) dozing, old lady?'  (<font color='red'><b>the apothecary</b></font>)</div>The attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in the affirmative. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)'ll go off in that way, if you don't make a row,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man. <div class="bookquote">` Put the light on the floor.
<p/>The attendant did as she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) was told: shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) head meanwhile, to intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time returned.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) won't see it there.'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>The mistress, with an expression of impatience, wrapped herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) shawl, and sat at the foot of the bed.
<p/>The apothecary's apprentice, having completed the manufacture of the toothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so: when apparently growing rather dull, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wished Mrs. Corney joy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) job, and took himself off on tiptoe.
<p/>When they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from the bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to catch the heat.
<p/>The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces, and made their ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position, they began to converse in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?'  (<font color='red'><b>the messenger</b></font>)</div>inquired the messenger. <div class="bookquote">` Not a word,'  (<font color='red'><b>the messenger</b></font>)</div>replied the other. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) plucked and tore at her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) arms for a little time; but I held her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) hands, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) soon dropped off.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) hasn't much strength in her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>), so I easily kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) quiet. I ain't so weak for an old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) drink the hot wine the doctor said she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) was to have?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>demanded the first. <div class="bookquote">` I tried to get it down,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rejoined the other. `
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) teeth were tight set, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I could do to get it back again.
<p/>Looking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard, the two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I mind the time,'  (<font color='red'><b>the hags</b></font>)</div>said the first speaker, <div class="bookquote">`when she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) would have done the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>So I drank it; and it did me good!' <div class="bookquote">` Ay, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) would,'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>rejoined the other; `she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) had a merry heart. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My old eyes have seen them--ay, and those old hands touched them too; for I have helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>), scores of times.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Stretching forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) trembling fingers as she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) spoke, the old creature shook them exultingly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) face, and fumbling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) pocket, brought out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) companion, and a few more into her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) own.
<p/>While they were thus employed, the matron, who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was to wait? <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A many, many, beautiful corpses she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laid out, as nice and neat as waxwork.

<p/>We have none of us long to wait for Death. Patience, patience! He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)'ll be here soon enough for us all.'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Hold your tongue, you doting idiot!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron sternly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But will never be again,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>added the second one; <div class="bookquote">`that is, she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>)'ll never wake again but once--and mind, mistress, that won't be for long!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`

 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned towards the bed, caused her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to look round.
<p/>The patient had raised herself upright, and was stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms towards them. <div class="bookquote">` Who's that?'  (<font color='red'><b>The patient</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, in a hollow voice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Hush, hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said one of the women, stooping over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Lie down, lie down!'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I'll never lie down again alive!'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, struggling. `
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into a chair by the bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! Come here! Nearer! Let me whisper in your ear.'  (<font color='red'><b>listeners</b></font>)</div>Turn them away,' said the woman, drowsily; `make haste!
<p/>The two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) best friends; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), when the superior pushed them from the room, closed the door, and returned to the bedside.
<p/>On being excluded, the old ladies changed their tone, and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely; since, in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin-and-water which had been privily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy old ladies themselves. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now listen to me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>said the dying woman aloud, as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy. <div class="bookquote">`

 (<font color='red'><b>the auditor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Ay,'  (<font color='red'><b>the auditor</b></font>)</div>murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) former drowsy state, <div class="bookquote">`what about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?--what about--I know!'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, jumping fiercely up: her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face flushed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes starting from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head--'I robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), so I did!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wasn't cold--I tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wasn't cold, when I stole it!' <div class="bookquote">`Stole what, for God's sake?'

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) wanted clothes to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) warm, and food to eat; but she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) had kept it safe, and had it in her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) bosom.

<p/>No, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>replied the matron, inclining her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) head to catch the words, as they came more faintly from the dying woman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The mother,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, making a more violent effort than before; <div class="bookquote">`the mother, when the pains of death first came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), whispered in my ear that if her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thin hands together, ``whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in this troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely desolate child, abandoned to its mercy!'''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the other. * * * * * <div class="bookquote">`Stone dead!'  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as the door was opened. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply, were left alone, hovering about the body.
<p/>And nothing to tell, after all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>rejoined the matron, walking carelessly away. CHAPTER XXV WHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY
<p/>While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat in the old den--the same from which Oliver had been removed by the girl--brooding over a dull, smoky fire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) held a pair of bellows upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knee, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had fallen into deep thought; and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) arms folded on them, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) chin resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thumbs, fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes, abstractedly, on the rusty bars.
<p/>At a table behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and Mr. Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling.
<p/>The countenance of the first-named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired great additional interest from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) close observance of the game, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling's hand; upon which, from time to time, as occasion served, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) bestowed a variety of earnest glances: wisely regulating his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) own play by the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) observations upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) neighbour's cards.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) also sustained a clay pipe between his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) teeth, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) only removed for a brief space when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table, which stood ready filled with gin-and-water for the accommodation of the company.
<p/>Master Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more excitable nature than his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) accomplished friend, it was observable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) more frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water, and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber.
<p/>Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close attachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) companion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master Bates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) friend to be <div class="bookquote">`blowed,'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>or to insert his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) head in a sack, or replying with some other neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application of which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling.
<p/>It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) partner invariably lost; and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates, appeared to afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) the highest amusement, inasmuch as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had never seen such a jolly game in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) born days. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That's two doubles and the rub,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chitling, with a very long face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) drew half-a-crown from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket. `
<p/>It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hat, as, indeed, was often his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) custom within doors. I never see such a feller as you, Jack; you win everything.
<p/>Either the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) consequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) reverie, and induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) to inquire what was the matter. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Even when we've good cards, Charley and I can't make nothing of 'em.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Matter, Fagin!' cried Charley. <div class="bookquote">` I wish you had watched the play.
<p/>Ay, ay!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was at no loss to understand the reason. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Tommy Chitling hasn't won a point; and I went partners with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) against the Artfull and dumb.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Try 'em again, Tom; try 'em again.'
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>` No more of it for me, thank <div class="bookquote">`ee, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Chitling; `I've had enough. That <div class="bookquote">`ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there's no standing again'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>).' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ha! ha! my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`you must get up very early in the morning, to win against the Dodger.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Morning!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said Charley Bates; <div class="bookquote">`you must put your boots on over-night, and have a telescope at each eye, and a opera-glass between your shoulders, if you want to come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>).'
 (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy, and offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first picture-card, at a shilling at a time.
<p/>Nobody accepting the challenge, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pipe being by this time smoked out, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in lieu of counters; whistling, meantime, with peculiar shrillness. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>How precious dull you are, Tommy!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the Dodger, stopping short when there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>)'s thinking of, Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`How should I know, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, looking round as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) plied the bellows. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Is that it, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not a bit of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of discourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>About his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) losses, maybe; or the little retirement in the country that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>)'s just left, eh? Ha! ha! What do you say, Charley?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I should say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Master Bates</b></font>)</div>replied Master Bates, with a grin, `that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was uncommon sweet upon Betsy. See how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)'s a-blushing! Oh, my eye!
<p/>Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim of the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) chair with such violence, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) balance, and pitched over upon the floor; where -LRB-the accident abating nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) merriment-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) lay at full length until his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) laugh was over, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) former position, and began another laugh. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Never mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins, and giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows.
<p/>here's a merry-go-rounder! Tommy Chitling's in love! Oh, Fagin, Fagin! what a spree!' ` Betsy's a fine girl. Stick up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>), Tom.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`What I mean to say, Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the face, <div class="bookquote">`is, that that isn't anything to anybody here.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><p/>Stick up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>).' <div class="bookquote">` No more it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew; <div class="bookquote">`Charley will talk. Don't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>), my dear; don't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>).
<p/>So I do do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) bids me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Chitling; <div class="bookquote">`I shouldn't have been milled, if it hadn't been for her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) advice.
<p/>Betsy's a fine girl. Do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) bids you, Tom, and you will make your fortune.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` But it turned out a good job for you; didn't it, Fagin!
<p/>It must come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when you don't want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You wouldn't mind it again, Tom, would you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>asked the Dodger, winking upon Charley and the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`if Bet was all right?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>And what's six weeks of it? Ah, to be sure, my dear,' replied the Jew. ` <div class="bookquote">` I mean to say that I shouldn't,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied Tom, angrily. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There, now. Ah! Who'll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Nobody, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew; <div class="bookquote">`not a soul, Tom.
<p/>I don't know one of 'em that would do it besides you; not one of 'em, my dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I might have got clear off, if I'd split upon her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>); mightn't I, Fagin?'
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>A word from me would have done it; wouldn't it, Fagin?' <div class="bookquote">`To be sure it would, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew. `
<p/>angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe. <div class="bookquote">` But I didn't blab it; did I, Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>the dupe</b></font>)</div>demanded Tom, pouring question upon question with great volubility. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A deal too stout, my dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Perhaps I was,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div>rejoined Tom, looking round; <div class="bookquote">`and if I was, what's to laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender.
<p/>But, unfortunately, Charley, in opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) mouth to reply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) was never more serious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender; who, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose his (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman, and caused him (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) to stagger to the wall, where he (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) stood panting for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No, no, to be sure,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew; <div class="bookquote">`you were too stout-hearted for that. Hark!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>cried the Dodger at this moment, <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I heard the tinkler.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>Catching up the light, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) crept softly upstairs. The bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in darkness.
<p/>The Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the candle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb show, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had better not be funny just then.
<p/>After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered Fagin mysteriously. <div class="bookquote">` What!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew, <div class="bookquote">`alone?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>Having performed this friendly office, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes on the Jew's face, and awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) directions.
<p/>The old man bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) face working with agitation the while, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) dreaded something, and feared to know the worst.
<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">` Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) asked. The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to leave the room. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>The Dodger</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; <div class="bookquote">`bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) down. Hush! Quiet, Charley! Gently, Tom! Scarce, scarce!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>This brief direction to Charley Bates, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) recent antagonist, was softly and immediately obeyed.
<p/>There was no sound of their whereabout, when the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hand, and followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock; who, after casting a hurried glance round the room, pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) face, and disclosed: all haggard, unwashed, and unshorn: the features of flash Toby Crackit. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>How are you, Faguey?'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>said this worthy, nodding to the Jew. ` Pop that shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it when I cut
<p/>With these words he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it round his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) feet upon the hob. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>See there, Faguey,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) said, pointing disconsolately to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) top boots; <div class="bookquote">`not a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of blacking, by Jove!
<p/>; that's the time of day! You'll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But don't look at me in that way, man.
<p/>I can't talk about business till I've eat and drank; so produce the sustainance, and let's have a quiet fill-out for the first time these three days!'
<p/>The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon the table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) leisure.
<p/>At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) brought; but in vain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) features that they always wore: and through dirt, and beard, and whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self-satisfied smirk of flash Toby Crackit.
<p/>Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched every morsel he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) mouth; pacing up and down the room, meanwhile, in irrepressible excitement.
<p/>All in good time. To judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation. It was all of no use.
<p/>Toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) could eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) closed the door, mixed a glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking. `
<p/>Mr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to declare that the gin was excellent; then placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) feet against the low mantelpiece, so as to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) boots to about the level of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) quietly resumed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>First and foremost, Faguey,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Toby. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, yes!'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>interposed the Jew, drawing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) chair. First and foremost, Faguey,' said the housebreaker, <div class="bookquote">`how's Bill?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the housebreaker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>screamed the Jew, starting from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) seat. <div class="bookquote">` Why, you don't mean to say--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>began Toby, turning pale. <div class="bookquote">` Mean!'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Where are they? Sikes and the boy! Where are they? Where have they been? Where are they hiding? Why have they not been here?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The crack failed,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>said Toby faintly. <div class="bookquote">` I know it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) pocket and pointing to it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What more?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` They fired and hit the boy. We cut over the fields at the back, with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) between us--straight as the crow flies--through hedge and ditch.
<p/>They gave chase. Damme! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon us.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` The boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Bill had him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) back, and scudded like the wind.
<p/>We stopped to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) between us; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) head hung down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) was cold. They were close upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows!
<p/>The Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hair, rushed from the room, and from the house.
<p/>We parted company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch. Alive or dead, that's all I know about him (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>A CHARACTER</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXVI IN WHICH
<p/>A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY THINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMED The old man had gained the street corner, before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to recover the effect of Toby Crackit's intelligence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) had relaxed nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) unusual speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and disordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers, who saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) danger: drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) back upon the pavement.
<p/>Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the main streets, and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) at length emerged on Snow Hill.
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) walked even faster than before; nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) linger until he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) had again turned into a court; when, as if conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) was now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) proper element, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) usual shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe more freely.
<p/>Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon the right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley, leading to Saffron Hill.
<p/>In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of second-hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns; for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick-pockets.
<p/>Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the door-posts; and the shelves, within, are piled with them.
<p/>It is a commercial colony of itself: the emporium of petty larceny: visited at early morning, and setting-in of dusk, by silent merchants, who traffic in dark back-parlours, and who go as strangely as they come.
<p/>Here, the clothesman, the shoe-vamper, and the rag-merchant, display their goods, as sign-boards to the petty thief; here, stores of old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and linen, rust and rot in the grimy cellars.
<p/>Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its barber, its coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse. It was into this place that the Jew turned.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look-out to buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) passed along.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) replied to their salutations in the same way; but bestowed no closer recognition until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) reached the further end of the alley; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) stopped, to address a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) person into a child's chair as the chair would hold, and was smoking a pipe at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) warehouse door. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!'  (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div>said this respectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew's inquiry after his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) health. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, elevating his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyebrows, and crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, I've heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied the trader; <div class="bookquote">`but it soon cools down again; don't you find it
<p/>so?'  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>Fagin nodded in the affirmative. Pointing in the direction of Saffron Hill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>At the Cripples?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>inquired the man. The Jew nodded. <div class="bookquote">` Let me see,'  (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div>pursued the merchant, reflecting. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, there's some half-dozen of 'em gone in, that I knows.
<p/>I don't think your friend's there.'  (<font color='red'><b>the merchant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Sikes is not, I suppose?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired the Jew, with a disappointed countenance. <div class="bookquote">` Non istwentus , as the lawyers say,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the little man, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and looking amazingly sly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Have you got anything in my line to-night?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Nothing to-night,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, turning away. <div class="bookquote">` Are you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>But as the Jew, looking back, waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hand to intimate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) preferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was, for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively's presence.
<p/>By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had got upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively, after ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) pipe with a grave demeanour.
<p/>The Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons: was the public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) dog have already figured.
<p/>Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hand, as if in search of some particular person.
<p/>The room was illuminated by two gas-lights; the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters, and closely-drawn curtains of faded red, from being visible outside.
<p/>The ceiling was blackened, to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more.
<p/>By degrees, however, as some of it cleared away through the open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused as the noises that greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded round a long table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose, and his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner.
<p/>As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over the keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a song; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could.
<p/>When this was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the professional gentleman on the chairman's right and left volunteered a duet, and sang it, with great applause.
<p/>cried the little man, calling after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Stop! I don't mind if I have a drop there with you!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group.
<p/>There was the chairman himself, -LRB-the landlord of the house,-RRB- a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were proceeding, rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eyes hither and thither, and, seeming to give himself up to joviality, had an eye for everything that was done, and an ear for everything that was said--and sharp ones, too.
<p/>Near him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) were the singers: receiving, with professional indifference, the compliments of the company, and applying themselves, in turn, to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more boisterous admirers; whose countenances, expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention, by their very repulsiveness.
<p/>Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its stages, were there, in their strongest aspect; and women: some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked: others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out, and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime; some mere girls, others but young women, and none past the prime of life; formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture.
<p/>Fagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without meeting that of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was in search.
<p/>Succeeding, at length, in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beckoned to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slightly, and left the room, as quietly as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had entered it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>inquired the man, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) out to the landing. <div class="bookquote">` Won't you join us?
<p/>They'll be delighted, every one of 'em.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The Jew shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head impatiently, and said in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">`Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) here?'  (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No,'  (<font color='red'><b>The Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the man. <div class="bookquote">` And no news of Barney?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>inquired Fagin. <div class="bookquote">` None,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Depend on it, they're on the scent down there; and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) moved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'d blow upon the thing at once.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) won't stir till it's all safe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'s all right enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>). I'll pound it, that Barney's managing properly.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) alone for that.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) be here to-night?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Monks, do you mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired the landlord, hesitating. <div class="bookquote">` Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` Yes.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Certain,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fob; <div class="bookquote">`I expected him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here before now.
<p/>No, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) might be to see the person in question, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was nevertheless relieved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) absence. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If you'll wait ten minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)'ll be--'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) I came here to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>); and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) must come to me to-night.
<p/>No, say to-morrow. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is not here, to-morrow will be time enough.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Good!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">` Nothing more?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not a word now,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, descending the stairs. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I say,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a hoarse whisper; <div class="bookquote">`what a time this would be for a sell!
<p/>I've got Phil Barker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Ah! But it's not Phil Barker's time,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, looking up. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Phil has something more to do, before we can afford to part with him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>); so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry lives-- while they last .
<p/>Ha! ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>The landlord reciprocated the old man's laugh; and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guests. The Jew was no sooner alone, than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes's residence, and performed the short remainder of the distance, on foot. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>muttered the Jew, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) knocked at the door, <div class="bookquote">`if there is any deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you are.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After a brief reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) called a hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) room, the woman said.
<p/>Fagin crept softly upstairs, and entered it without any previous ceremony. The girl was alone; lying with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head upon the table, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair straggling over it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has been drinking,'  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>thought the Jew, cooly, <div class="bookquote">`or perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is only miserable.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>The old man turned to close the door, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made this reflection; the noise thus occasioned, roused the girl.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crafty face narrowly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) inquired to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recital of Toby Crackit's story. When it was concluded, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sank into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) former attitude, but spoke not a word.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feverishly changed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) position, shuffled her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet upon the ground; but this was all.
<p/>During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly returned.
<p/>Apparently satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) inspection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) coughed twice or thrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the girl heeded him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) no more than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had been made of stone.
<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) made another attempt; and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hands together, said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) most conciliatory tone, <div class="bookquote">`And where should you think Bill was now, my dear?'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not tell; and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), to be crying. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And the boy, too,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, straining his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes to catch a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">` Poor leetle child!
<p/>The child,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the girl, suddenly looking up, <div class="bookquote">`is better where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) lies dead in the ditch and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) young bones may rot there.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Left in a ditch, Nance; only think!' ` <div class="bookquote">`What!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew, in amazement. <div class="bookquote">` Ay, I do,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>returned the girl, meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) gaze. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I shall be glad to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over. I can't bear to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) about me.
<p/>The sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) turns me against myself, and all of you.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Pooh!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, scornfully. <div class="bookquote">` You're drunk.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Am I?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl bitterly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's no fault of yours, if I am not! You'd never have me anything else, if you had your will, except now;--the humour doesn't suit you, doesn't it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>rejoined the Jew, furiously. <div class="bookquote">` It does not.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Change it, then!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>responded the girl, with a laugh. <div class="bookquote">` Change it!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) companion's unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, <div class="bookquote">`I will change it!
<p/>Listen to me, who with six words, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) bull's throat between my fingers now.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) comes back, and leaves the boy behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>); if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) gets off free, and dead or alive, fails to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) to me; murder him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) yourself if you would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) escape Jack Ketch.

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>When the boy's worth hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could whistle away the lives of!
<p/>And me bound, too, to a born devil that only wants the will, and has the power to, to--' Panting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that instant checked the torrent of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrath, and changed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole demeanour.
<p/>A moment before, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clenched hands had grasped the air; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes had dilated; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face grown livid with passion; but now, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`What is all this?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl involuntarily. <div class="bookquote">` What is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>pursued Fagin, mad with rage. ` After a short silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) ventured to look round at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) companion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) appeared somewhat reassured, on beholding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the same listless attitude from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had first roused her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Nancy, dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>croaked the Jew, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) usual voice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Did you mind me, dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Don't worry me now, Fagin!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head languidly. <div class="bookquote">` If Bill has not done it this time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) will another.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) has done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) can; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) can't he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) won't; so no more about that.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Regarding this boy, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hands nervously together. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The boy must take his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chance with the rest,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>interrupted Nancy, hastily; <div class="bookquote">`and I say again, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is dead, and out of harm's way, and out of yours,--that is, if Bill comes to no harm.
<p/>And if Toby got clear off, Bill's pretty sure to be safe; for Bill's worth two of Toby any time.'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`And about what I was saying, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>observed the Jew, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) glistening eye steadily upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You must say it all over again, if it's anything you want me to do,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>rejoined Nancy; `and if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow.
<p/>Fagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) unguarded hints; but, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) searching looks, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) original impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being more than a trifle in liquor, was confirmed.
<p/>Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the Jew's female pupils; and in which, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than checked.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva which pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the Jew's supposition; and when, after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) subsided, first into dullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the influence of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) shed tears one minute, and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of <div class="bookquote">`Never say die!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy
<p/>, Mr. Fagin, who had had considerable experience of such matters in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) time, saw, with great satisfaction, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very far gone indeed.
<p/>Having eased his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) twofold object of imparting to the girl what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had, that night, heard, and of ascertaining, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own eyes, that Sikes had not returned, Mr. Fagin again turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) face homeward: leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) young friend asleep, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head upon the table.
<p/>You put me up for a minute; but now I'm stupid again.' It was within an hour of midnight. The weather being dark, and piercing cold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had no great temptation to loiter.
<p/>The sharp wind that scoured the streets, seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as of dust and mud, for few people were abroad, and they were to all appearance hastening fast home.
<p/>It blew from the right quarter for the Jew, however, and straight before it he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) went: trembling, and shivering, as every fresh gust drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) rudely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had reached the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) own street, and was already fumbling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pocket for the door-key, when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road, glided up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) unperceived. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Fagin!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>whispered a voice close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) ear. <div class="bookquote">` Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, turning quickly round, <div class="bookquote">`is that--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Yes!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>interrupted the stranger. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`On your business, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) companion, and slackening his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pace as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have been lingering here these two hours. Where the devil have you been?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>On your business all night.' <div class="bookquote">` Oh, of course!'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, with a sneer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well; and what's come of it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Nothing good,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` Nothing bad, I hope?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a startled look on his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) companion.
<p/>The Jew shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) head, and was about to reply, when the stranger, interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), motioned to the house, before which they had by this time arrived: remarking, that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had better say what he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had got to say, under cover: for his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) blood was chilled with standing about so long, and the wind blew through him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).
<p/>Fagin looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered something about having no fire; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) companion repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) request in a peremptory manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) unlocked the door, and requested him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) to close it softly, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) got a light. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's as dark as the grave,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the man, groping forward a few steps. <div class="bookquote">` Make haste!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Shut the door,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>whispered Fagin from the end of the passage.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) spoke, it closed with a loud noise. <div class="bookquote">` That wasn't my doing,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the other man, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The wind blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other. Look sharp with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>After a short absence, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby Crackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in the front one.
<p/>We can say the few words we've got to say in here, my dear,' said the Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; `
<p/>and as there are holes in the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we'll set the candle on the stairs.
<p/>With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door.
<p/>This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) led the way into the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a broken arm-chair, and an old couch or sofa without covering, which stood behind the door.
<p/>Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the arm-chair opposite, they sat face to face.
<p/>It was not quite dark; the door was partially open; and the candle outside, threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall.
<p/>Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs. Beckoning the man to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) led the way upstairs. <div class="bookquote">` There!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They conversed for some time in whispers.
<p/>Though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation.
<p/>They might have been talking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks--by which name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquy--said, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) voice a little, <div class="bookquote">`I tell you again, it was badly planned.
<p/>Why not have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) here among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him (<font color='blue'><b>pickpocket</b></font>) at once?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man times</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Only hear him (<font color='blue'><b>pickpocket</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, do you mean to say you couldn't have done it, if you had chosen?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>demanded Monks, sternly. <div class="bookquote">` Haven't you done it, with other boys, scores of times?
<p/>If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn't you have got him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps for life?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Whose turn would that have served, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>inquired the Jew humbly. <div class="bookquote">` Mine,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied Monks. <div class="bookquote">` But not mine,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, submissively. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my good friend?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I saw it was not easy to train him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to the business,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was not like other boys in the same circumstances.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) might have become of use to me. What then?' demanded Monks. ` <div class="bookquote">`Curse him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), no!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man thief</b></font>)</div>muttered the man, <div class="bookquote">`or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been a thief, long ago.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man thief</b></font>)</div><p/>I had no hold upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worse,' pursued the Jew, anxiously watching the countenance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) companion. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` His (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hand was not in. I had nothing to frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) with; which we always must have in the beginning, or we labour in vain.
<p/>What could I do? Send him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) out with the Dodger and Charley? We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I trembled for us all.'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And I don't quarrel with it now; because, if it had never happened, you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and so led to the discovery that it was him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) you were looking for.
<p/>That was not my doing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>observed Monks. <div class="bookquote">` No, no, my dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>renewed the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` Well! I got him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) back for you by means of the girl; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) begins to favour him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, we can't afford to do that just now, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, smiling; <div class="bookquote">`and, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one of these days, I might be glad to have it done.
<p/>Throttle the girl!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said Monks, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">` I know what these girls are, Monks, well. As soon as the boy begins to harden, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll care no more for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), than for a block of wood.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is alive, I can make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) one from this time; and, if--if--'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, drawing nearer to the other,--`it's not likely, mind,--but if the worst comes to the worst, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is dead--' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You want him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) made a thief. It's no fault of mine if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>interposed the other man, with a look of terror, and clasping the Jew's arm with trembling hands. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mind that. Fagin! I had no hand in it. Anything but his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) death, I told you from the first. I won't shed blood; it's always found out, and haunts a man besides.
<p/>What's that?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both arms, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) sprung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If they shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) dead, I was not the cause; do you hear me? Fire this infernal den! Where?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>` Yonder! replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The shadow! I saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the wainscot like a breath!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew released his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room. The candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been placed.
<p/>It showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white faces. They listened intently: a profound silence reigned throughout the house. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's your fancy,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">` I'll swear I saw it!'
 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) associate, and, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) could follow, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pleased, ascended the stairs.
<p/>replied Monks, trembling. <div class="bookquote">` It was bending forward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>They looked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty.
<p/>The green damp hung upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle; but all was still as death. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They descended into the passage, and thence into the cellars below. What do you think now?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, when they had regained the passage. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pocket; and explained, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) first went downstairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had locked them in, to prevent any intrusion on the conference.
<p/>Besides ourselves, there's not a creature in the house except Toby and the boys; and they're safe enough. See here!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Monks</b></font>) protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Monks</b></font>) gave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Monks</b></font>) excited imagination.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Monks</b></font>) declined any renewal of the conversation, however, for that night: suddenly remembering that it was past one o'clock. And so the amiable couple parted.
<p/>As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) back to the fire, and the skirts of his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) coat gathered up under his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) arms, until such time as it might suit his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) pleasure to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>); and as it would still less become his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) station, or his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection, and in whose ear he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) had whispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words--trusting that he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) knows his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) place, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated--hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank, and -LRB-by consequence-RRB- great virtues, imperatively claim at his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Towards this end, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) had purposed to introduce, in this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong: which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right-minded reader but which he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) is unfortunately compelled, by want of time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity; on the arrival of which, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) will be prepared to show, that a beadle properly constituted: that is to say, a parochial beadle, attached to a parochial workhouse, and attending in his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) official capacity the parochial church: is, in right and virtue of his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) office, possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and that to none of those excellences, can mere companies' beadles, or court-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles -LRB-save the last, and
<p/>CHAPTER XXVII ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY, MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY they in a very lowly and inferior degree-RRB-, lay the remotest sustainable claim.
<p/>Mr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs, made a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times; before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return.
<p/>Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney's approach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) were further to allay his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney's chest of drawers.
<p/>Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers: which, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture, carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with dried lavender: seemed to yield him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) exceeding satisfaction.
<p/>Arriving, in course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer -LRB-in which was the key-RRB-, and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken, gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) old attitude, said, with a grave and determined air, <div class="bookquote">`I'll do it!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head in a waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) took a view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) legs in profile, with much seeming pleasure and interest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs. Corney, hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a chair by the fireside, and covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) eyes with one hand, placed the other over her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) heart, and gasped for breath. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Pray answer me: I'm on--on--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bumble, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) alarm, could not immediately think of the word <div class="bookquote">`tenterhooks,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">`broken bottles.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Corney,' said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, `what is this, ma'am? Has anything happened, ma'am? <div class="bookquote">` Oh, Mr. Bumble!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the lady, <div class="bookquote">`I have been so dreadfully put out!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Put out, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bumble; <div class="bookquote">`who has dared to--? I know!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, <div class="bookquote">`this is them wicious paupers!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` It's dreadful to think of!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said the lady, shuddering. <div class="bookquote">` Then don't think of it, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I can't help it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>whimpered the lady. <div class="bookquote">` Then take something, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble soothingly. <div class="bookquote">` A little of the wine?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not for the world!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Corney. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I couldn't,--oh! The top shelf in the right-hand corner-- oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>Uttering these words, the good lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms.
<p/>Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching a pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady's lips. `
<p/>Mr. Bumble raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and, bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) nose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'm better now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after drinking half of it. Peppermint,' exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently on the beadle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) spoke. `
<p/>Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lips; took another taste; and put the cup down empty. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Try it! There's a little--a little something else in it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>It's very comforting,' said Mrs. Corney. <div class="bookquote">` Very much so indeed, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>said the beadle.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) drew a chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Corney. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am a foolish, excitable, weak creetur.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Not weak, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) chair a little closer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Are you a weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` We are all weak creeturs,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general principle. `
<p/>By the expiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney's chair, where it had previously rested, to Mrs. Corney's apron-string, round which it gradually became entwined. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So we are,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>said the beadle. Nothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. We are all weak creeturs,' said Mr. Bumble.
<p/>Mrs. Corney sighed. <div class="bookquote">` Don't sigh, Mrs. Corney,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` I can't help it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Corney. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) sighed again. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This is a very comfortable room, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble looking round. <div class="bookquote">` Another room, and this, ma'am, would be a complete thing.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`It would be too much for one,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>murmured the lady. <div class="bookquote">` But not for two, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents. `
<p/>Mrs. Corney drooped her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) head, when the beadle said this; the beadle drooped his (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>), to get a view of Mrs. Corney's face.
<p/>Mrs. Corney, with great propriety, turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) head away, and released her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) hand to get at her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Eh, Mrs. Corney?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>The board allows you coals, don't they, Mrs. Corney?' inquired the beadle, affectionately pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">` And candles,'  (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the pressure. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Coals, candles, and house-rent free,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` Oh, Mrs. Corney, what an Angel you are!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) sank into Mr. Bumble's arms; and that gentleman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) agitation, imprinted a passionate kiss upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) chaste nose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Such porochial perfection!'  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously. <div class="bookquote">` You know that Mr. Slout is worse to-night, my fascinator?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) can't live a week, the doctor says,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) is the master of this establishment; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) death will cause a wacancy; that wacancy must be filled up.
<p/>Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this opens! What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Corney sobbed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The little word?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Corney/Corney</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty. <div class="bookquote">` The one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ye-- ye--yes!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>sighed out the matron. <div class="bookquote">` One more,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>pursued the beadle; <div class="bookquote">`compose your darling feelings for only one more. When is it to come off?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the beadle</b></font>)</div><p/>At length summoning up courage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) arms around Mr. Bumble's neck, and said, it might be as soon as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) pleased, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">`a irresistible duck.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture; which was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of the lady's spirits.
<p/>Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak: and twice failed. While it was being disposed of, she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) acquainted Mr. Bumble with the old woman's decease. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Very good,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said that gentleman, sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) peppermint; <div class="bookquote">`I'll call at Sowerberry's as I go home, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) to send to-morrow morning.
<p/>Was it that as frightened you, love?'  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` It wasn't anything particular, dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady evasively. <div class="bookquote">` It must have been something, love,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>urged Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Won't you tell your own B.?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not now,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined the lady; <div class="bookquote">`one of these days. After we're married, dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` After we're married!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If I thought it was,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Bumble; <div class="bookquote">`if I thought as any one of 'em had dared to lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`They wouldn't have dared to do it, love,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>responded the lady. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It wasn't any impudence from any of them male paupers as--'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`No, no, love!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>interposed the lady, hastily. <div class="bookquote">` They had better not!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) fist. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Let me see any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do it; and I can tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wouldn't do it a second time!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed no very high compliment to the lady's charms; but, as Mr. Bumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was much touched with this proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) devotion, and protested, with great admiration, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was indeed a dove.
<p/>The dove then turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) coat-collar, and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked hat; and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) future partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing, for a few minutes, in the male paupers' ward, to abuse them a little, with the view of satisfying himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) could fill the office of workhouse-master with needful acerbity.
<p/>Assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) qualifications, Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) future promotion: which served to occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mind until he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) reached the shop of the undertaker.
<p/>Now, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was not closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up.
<p/>Mr. Bumble tapped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cane on the counter several times; but, attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) made bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) saw what was going forward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was not a little surprised.
<p/>The cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and butter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle.
<p/>At the upper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an easy-chair, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) legs thrown over one of the arms: an open clasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other.
<p/>A more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman's nose, and a kind of fixed wink in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right eye, denoted that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was in a slight degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) oysters, for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever, could have sufficiently accounted. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stood Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity. Here's a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte; <div class="bookquote">`try him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>), do; only this one.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What a delicious thing is a oyster!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>remarked Mr. Claypole, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) had swallowed it. <div class="bookquote">` What a pity it is, a number of 'em should ever make you feel uncomfortable; isn't it, Charlotte?'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` It's quite a cruelty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">` So it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>acquiesced Mr. Claypole. <div class="bookquote">` An't yer fond of oysters?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not overmuch,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>replied Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I like to see you eat 'em, Noah dear, better than eating 'em myself.'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Lor!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, reflectively; <div class="bookquote">`how queer!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Have another,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Here's one with such a beautiful, delicate beard!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I can't manage any more,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah. <div class="bookquote">` I'm very sorry. Come here, Charlotte, and I'll kiss yer.'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room. <div class="bookquote">` Say that again, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>Charlotte uttered a scream, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) apron.
<p/>Mr. Claypole, without making any further change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) position than suffering his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken terror. <div class="bookquote">`Say it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>How dare you mention such a thing, sir? And how dare you encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), you insolent minx? Kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Faugh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I didn't mean to do it!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, blubbering. <div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s always a-kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)'s always a-doin' of it, Mr. Bumble, sir; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and makes all manner of love!' `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Oh, Noah,'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>cried Charlotte, reproachfully. <div class="bookquote">` Yer are; yer know yer are!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>retorted Noah. <div class="bookquote">` Silence!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Bumble, sternly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master comes home, at your peril; and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) does come home, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) that Mr. Bumble said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was to send a old woman's shell after breakfast to-morrow morning.
<p/>Take yourself downstairs, ma'am. Do you hear sir? Kissing!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Bumble, holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">` The sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful!
<p/>If Parliament don't take their abominable courses under consideration, this country's ruined, and the character of the peasantry gone for ever!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>And now that we have accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) so far on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) road home, and have made all necessary preparations for the old woman's funeral, let us set on foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>).
<p/>With these words, the beadle strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker's premises. CHAPTER XXVIII LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) ADVENTURES <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Wolves tear your throats!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>muttered Sikes, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) teeth. <div class="bookquote">` I wish I was among some of you; you'd howl the hoarser for it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>As Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate ferocity that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) desperate nature was capable of, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) rested the body of the wounded boy across his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) bended knee; and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head, for an instant, to look back at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pursuers.
<p/>There was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in every direction. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stop, you white-livered hound!'  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>cried the robber, shouting after Toby Crackit, who, making the best use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) long legs, was already ahead. `
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) was not quite satisfied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) was beyond the range of pistol-shot; and Sikes was in no mood to be played with. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stop!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>The repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand-still. Bear a hand with the boy,' cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) confederate. <div class="bookquote">`Come back!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><p/>Toby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) came slowly along. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Quicker!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) feet, and drawing a pistol from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) pocket. `
<p/>Sikes, again looking round, could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) stood; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't play booty with me.'  (<font color='red'><b>a couple</b></font>)</div>At this moment the noise grew louder. It's all up, Bill!' cried Toby; <div class="bookquote">`drop the kid, and show 'em your heels.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><p/>With this parting advice, Mr. Crackit, preferring the chance of being shot by his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) friend, to the certainty of being taken by his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) enemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full speed.
<p/>Sikes clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form of Oliver, the cape in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been hurriedly muffled; ran along the front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those behind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before another hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pistol high into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily answered to the command.
<p/>Ho, ho, there!'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cried a tremulous voice in the rear. <div class="bookquote">` Pincher! Neptune! Come here, come here!'  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>Three men, who had by this time advanced some distance into the field, stopped to take counsel together. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My advice, or, leastways, I should say, my orders , is,'  (<font color='red'><b>counsel</b></font>)</div>said the fattest man of the party, `that we <div class="bookquote">`mediately go home again.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr. Giles,'  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>said a shorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very pale in the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I shouldn't wish to appear ill-mannered, gentlemen,'  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>said the third, who had called the dogs back, <div class="bookquote">`Mr. Giles ought to know.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Certainly,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the shorter man; `and whatever Mr. Giles says, it isn't our place to contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>). No, no, I know my sitiwation!
<p/>To tell the truth, the little man did seem to know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) situation, and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one; for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth chattered in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thank my stars, I know my sitiwation.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>You are afraid, Brittles,' said Mr. Giles. <div class="bookquote">` I an't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Brittles. <div class="bookquote">` You are,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Giles. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles's taunt; and Mr. Giles's taunt had arisen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) indignation at having the responsibility of going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment.
<p/>You're a falsehood, Mr. Giles,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Brittles. <div class="bookquote">` You're a lie, Brittles,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles. The third man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'll tell you what it is, gentlemen,'  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`we're all afraid.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Speak for yourself, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, who was the palest of the party. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So I do,'  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>replied the man. <div class="bookquote">` It's natural and proper to be afraid, under such circumstances. I am.'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` So am I,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Brittles; <div class="bookquote">`only there's no call to tell a man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, so bounceably.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles, who at once owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again with the completest unanimity, until Mr. Giles -LRB-who had the shortest wind of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork-RRB- most handsomely insisted on stopping, to make an apology for his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) hastiness of speech. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But it's wonderful,'  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had explained, `what a man will do, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) blood is up. I should have committed murder--
<p/>As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as their blood, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), had all gone down again; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I know I should--if we'd caught one of them rascals.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I know what it was,' said Mr. Giles; <div class="bookquote">`it was the gate.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I shouldn't wonder if it was,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Brittles, catching at the idea. <div class="bookquote">` You may depend upon it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Giles, <div class="bookquote">`that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement.
<p/>I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was climbing over it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>By a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment.
<p/>It was quite obvious, therefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place, because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance.
<p/>This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse, and who had been roused, together with his (<font color='blue'><b>burglars</b></font>) two mongrel curs, to join in the pursuit.
<p/>Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion; Brittles was a lad of all-work: who, having entered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) service a mere child, was treated as a promising young boy still, though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was something past thirty.
<p/>Encouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very close together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round, whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried back to a tree, behind which they had left their lantern, lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire.
<p/>Catching up the light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round trot; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne.
<p/>The air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke.
<p/>The grass was wet; the pathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning.
<p/>The air become more sharp and piercing, as its first dull hue--the death of night, rather than the birth of day--glimmered faintly in the sky.
<p/>The objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes.
<p/>Still, Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>). Morning drew on apace. The rain came down, thick and fast, and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes.
<p/>But, Oliver felt it not, as it beat against him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) still lay stretched, helpless and unconscious, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bed of clay.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl, hung heavy and useless at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) side; the bandage was saturated with blood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was so weak, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) looked feebly round for help, and groaned with pain.
<p/>Trembling in every joint, from cold and exhaustion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground.
<p/>After a short return of the stupor in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been so long plunged, Oliver: urged by a creeping sickness at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heart, which seemed to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lay there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) must surely die: got upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feet, and essayed to walk.
<p/>At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and uttering it, the boy awoke. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head was dizzy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) staggered to and fro like a drunken man.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) kept up, nevertheless, and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head drooping languidly on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breast, went stumbling onward, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew not whither.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing--for the very words they said, sounded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) ears; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) own attention, as it were, by making some violent effort to save himself from falling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) was talking to them.
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) felt the robber's grasp upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) wrist.
<p/>Suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) started back at the report of firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hurriedly away.
<p/>And now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) mind. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) incessantly.
<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars of gates, or through hedge-gaps as they came in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) way, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) reached a road.
<p/>Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house, which perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) could reach.
<p/>Pitying his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) condition, they might have compassion on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>); and if they did not, it would be better, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) thought, to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) summoned up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) strength for one last trial, and bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) faltering steps towards it. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had seen it before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) remembered nothing of its details; but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>). That garden wall!
<p/>On the grass inside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had fallen on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) knees last night, and prayed the two men's mercy. It was the very house they had attempted to rob.
<p/>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) recognised the place, that, for the instant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) forgot the agony of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) wound, and thought only of flight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) could scarcely stand: and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) were in full possession of all the best powers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) slight and youthful frame, whither could he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) fly?
<p/>Oliver felt such fear come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) Flight! He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pushed against the garden-gate; it was unlocked, and swung open on its hinges.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) tottered across the lawn; climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) whole strength failing him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico.
<p/>It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker, were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen.
<p/>Not that it was Mr. Giles's habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants: towards whom it was rather his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) wont to deport himself with a lofty affability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) superior position in society.
<p/>But, death, fires, and burglary, make all men equals; so Mr. Giles sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) legs stretched out before the kitchen fender, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) left arm on the table, while, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) right, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery, to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) bearers -LRB-but especially the cook and housemaid, who were of the party-RRB- listened with breathless interest. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It was about half-past two,'  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, <div class="bookquote">`or I wouldn't swear that it mightn't have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and, turning round in my bed, as it might be so,
<p/>-LRB-here Mr. Giles turned round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) chair, and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) to imitate bed-clothes,-RRB- I fancied I heerd a noise.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the housemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker, who pretended not to hear. <div class="bookquote">`--Heerd
<p/>I says, at first, ``This is illusion''; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the noise again, distinct.'  (<font color='red'><b>the housemaid</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>a noise,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Giles. <div class="bookquote">` What sort of a noise?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>asked the cook. <div class="bookquote">` A kind of a busting noise,'  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Giles, looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>suggested Brittles. <div class="bookquote">` It was, when you heerd it, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Giles; <div class="bookquote">`but, at this time, it had a busting sound.
<p/>I turned down the clothes' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>; continued Giles, rolling back the table-cloth, <div class="bookquote">`sat up in bed; and listened.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated <div class="bookquote">`Lor!'  (<font color='red'><b>housemaid</b></font>)</div>and drew their chairs closer together. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I heerd it now, quite apparent,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>resumed Mr. Giles. <div class="bookquote">` ``Somebody,'' I says, ``is forcing of a door, or window; what's to be done?
<p/>I'll call up that poor lad, Brittles, and save him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) from being murdered in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) bed; or his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) throat,'' I says, ``may be cut from his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) right ear to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) left, without his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) ever knowing it.
<p/>'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>Here, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) upon the speaker, and stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mouth wide open, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) face expressive of the most unmitigated horror. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I tossed off the clothes,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Giles, throwing away the table-cloth, and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, <div class="bookquote">`got softly out of bed; drew on a pair of--'  (<font color='red'><b>housemaid</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>shoes , sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>housemaid</b></font>)</div>said Giles, turning upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), and laying great emphasis on the word; <div class="bookquote">`seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) room.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We're dead men, I think, Brittles,'' I says,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>continued Giles; <div class="bookquote">```but don't be frightened.'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) frightened?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>asked the cook. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So you did,'  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>observed Brittles, in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">` '' Not a bit of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Giles. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was as firm--ah!

<p/>You're a woman,'  (<font color='red'><b>the housemaid</b></font>)</div>retorted Brittles, plucking up a little. <div class="bookquote">` Brittles is right,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) head, approvingly; <div class="bookquote">`from a woman, nothing else was to be expected.
<p/>We, being men, took a dark lantern that was standing on Brittle's hob, and groped our way downstairs in the pitch
<p/>Mr. Giles had risen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) seat, and taken two steps with his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) eyes shut, to accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) description with appropriate action, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) started violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) chair.
<p/>dark,--as it might be so.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>The cook and housemaid screamed. <div class="bookquote">` It was a knock,'  (<font color='red'><b>housemaid</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in the morning,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), and looking very blank himself; <div class="bookquote">`but the door must be opened.
<p/>Mr. Giles, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>); at all events, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) tendered no reply.
<p/>Open the door, somebody.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Nobody moved. <div class="bookquote">` Do you hear, somebody?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nobody</b></font>)</div>Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had suddenly fallen asleep.
<p/>If Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of witnesses,' said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, <div class="bookquote">`I am ready to make one.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>The women were out of the question. ` <div class="bookquote">` So am I,'  (<font color='red'><b>The women</b></font>)</div>said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had fallen asleep.
<p/>Brittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat re-assured by the discovery -LRB-made on throwing open the shutters-RRB- that it was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front.
<p/>By the advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked very loud, to warn any evil-disposed person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by a master-stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman, the dogs' tails were well pinched, in the hall, to make them bark savagely.
<p/>These precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the tinker's arm -LRB-to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) running away, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) pleasantly said-RRB-, and gave the word of command to open the door.
<p/>Brittles obeyed; the group, peeping timorously over each other's shoulders, beheld no more formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and exhausted, who raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their compassion. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear. A boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into the background. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What's the matter with the--eh?--Why--Brittles--look here--don't you know?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) uttered a loud cry.
<p/>Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and one arm -LRB-fortunately not the broken limb-RRB- lugged him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) straight into the hall, and deposited him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) at full length on the floor thereof. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) is!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up the staircase; <div class="bookquote">`here's one of the thieves, ma'am!
<p/>--In a lantern, miss,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>cried Brittles, applying one hand to the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) mouth, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) voice might travel the better.
<p/>The two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr. Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should die before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could be hanged.
<p/>In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard a sweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Here's a thief, miss! Wounded, miss! I shot him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>), miss; and Brittles held the light.'  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Giles!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispered the voice from the stair-head. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'm here, miss,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Giles. <div class="bookquote">` Don't be frightened, miss; I ain't much injured. He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) didn't make a very desperate resistance, miss!
<p/>I was soon too many for him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the young lady; <div class="bookquote">`you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did.
<p/>Is the poor creature much hurt?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Wounded desperate, miss,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>replied Giles, with indescribable complacency. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was a-going, miss,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>bawled Brittles, in the same manner as before. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Wouldn't you like to come and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), miss, in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) should?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Hush, pray; there's a good man!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined the lady. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Wait quietly only one instant, while I speak to aunt.'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped away.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr. Giles's room; and that Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to Chertsey: from which place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was to despatch, with all speed, a constable and doctor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But won't you take one look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), first, miss?'  (<font color='red'><b>doctor</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Giles, with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had skilfully brought down. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Not one little peep, miss?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not now, for the world,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the young lady. <div class="bookquote">` Poor fellow! Oh! treat him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) kindly, Giles for my sake!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned away, with a glance as proud and admiring as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) own child.
<p/>Then, bending over Oliver, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) helped to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) upstairs, with the care and solicitude of a woman. CHAPTER XXIX HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH OLIVER
<p/>In a handsome room: though its furniture had rather the air of old-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at a well-spread breakfast-table.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) station some half-way between the side-board and the breakfast-table; and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) body drawn up to its full height, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) head thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) left leg advanced, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) right hand thrust into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) waist-coat, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) left hung down by his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own merits and importance.
<p/>Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed oaken chair in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sat, was not more upright than she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect, she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sat, in a stately manner, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands folded on the table before her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>RESORTED Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes -LRB-and age had dimmed but little of their brightness-RRB- were attentively upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) young companion.
<p/>The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood; at that age, when, if ever angels be for God's good purposes enthroned in mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in such as hers.
<p/>Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) element, nor its rough creatures her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fit companions.
<p/>The very intelligence that shone in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) noble head, seemed scarcely of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) age, or of the world; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights that played about the face, and left no shadow there; above all, the smile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside peace and happiness.
<p/>Chancing to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes as the elder lady was regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) playfully put back her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair, which was simply braided on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forehead; and threw into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not past seventeen. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was busily engaged in the little offices of the table. And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>asked the old lady, after a pause. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>An hour and twelve minutes, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Giles, referring to a silver watch, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) drew forth by a black ribbon. `
<p/>And seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ever being a fast one. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is always slow,'  (<font color='red'><b>Brittles a boy</b></font>)</div>remarked the old lady. <div class="bookquote">` Brittles always was a slow boy, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the attendant. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gets worse instead of better, I think,' said the elder lady. `
<p/>Mr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate: out of which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door: and who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process, burst into the room, and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast-table together. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is very inexcusable in him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) stops to play with any other boys,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said the young lady, smiling. I never heard of such a thing!' exclaimed the fat gentleman. `
<p/>With these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found themselves. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My dear Mrs. Maylie--bless my soul--in the silence of the night, too--I never heard of such a thing!'  (<font color='red'><b>both ladies</b></font>)</div>You ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,' said the fat gentleman. `
<p/>Bless me, my man should have come in a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted; or anybody, I'm sure, under such circumstances.
<p/>The doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two previous. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And you, Miss Rose,'  (<font color='red'><b>gentlemen</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, turning to the young lady, <div class="bookquote">`I--'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Oh! very much so, indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said Rose, interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">`but there is a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Why didn't you send? Dear, dear! So unexpected! In the silence of the night, too!' <div class="bookquote">` Ah! to be sure,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor, `so there is.
<p/>Mr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights, blushed very red, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had had that honour. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Honour, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the doctor; `well, I don't know; perhaps it's as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at twelve paces.
<p/>Mr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) glory, answered respectfully, that it was not for the like of him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) to judge about that; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That was your handiwork, Giles, I understand.'  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>Fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) fired in the air, and you've fought a duel, Giles.' Gad, that's true!' said the doctor. `
<p/>Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)? Show me the way. I'll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie. That's the little window that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) got in at, eh?
<p/>Talking all the way, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) is going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles round as <div class="bookquote">`the doctor,'  (<font color='red'><b>a surgeon</b></font>)</div>had grown fat, more from good-humour than from good living: and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any explorer alive.
<p/>A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above.
<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) patient; looked very mysterious, and closed the door, carefully. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,'  (<font color='red'><b>patient</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) back to the door, as if to keep it shut. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, I couldn't have believed it!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>The doctor was absent, much longer than either he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) or the ladies had anticipated. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is not in danger, I hope?' said the old lady. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, that would not be an extraordinary thing, under the circumstances,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`though I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is. Have you seen the thief?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>`I beg your pardon, ma'am, interposed Mr. Giles; <div class="bookquote">`but I was going to tell you about him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) when Doctor Losberne came in.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) mind to the avowal, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had only shot a boy.
<p/>Such commendations had been bestowed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) bravery, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) could not, for the life of him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes; during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>rejoined the old lady. <div class="bookquote">` Nor heard anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose</b></font>)</div>Rose wished to see the man,' said Mrs. Maylie, <div class="bookquote">`but I wouldn't hear of it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Humph!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>rejoined the doctor. <div class="bookquote">` There is nothing very alarming in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) appearance. Have you any objection to see him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) in my presence?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Then I think it is necessary,' said the doctor; `at all events, I am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you postponed it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`If it be necessary,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the old lady, <div class="bookquote">`certainly not.'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>` He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is perfectly quiet and comfortable now. Allow me-- Miss Rose, will you permit me?
<p/>With many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady's arm through one of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); and offering his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie, led them, with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, in a whisper, as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) softly turned the handle of a bedroom-door, <div class="bookquote">`let us hear what you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/>Not the slightest fear, I pledge you my honour!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXX RELATES WHAT OLIVER'S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM He (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) has not been shaved very recently, but he (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) don't look at all ferocious notwithstanding.
<p/>Motioning them to advance, he (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back the curtains of the bed.
<p/>Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child: worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) wounded arm, bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) breast; his (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) head reclined upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) long hair, as it streamed over the pillow.
<p/>Stop, though! Let me first see that he (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) is in visiting order.' Stepping before them, he (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) looked into the room. The honest gentleman held the curtain in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand, and looked on, for a minute or so, in silence.
<p/>Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was watching the patient thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered Oliver's hair from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face.
<p/>The boy stirred, and smiled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sleep, as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had never known.
<p/>Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stooped over him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) tears fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) forehead. What can this mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the elder lady. <div class="bookquote">` This poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Vice,' said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, <div class="bookquote">`takes up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) abode in many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My dear young lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) head; `crime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered alone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` But at so early an age!'  (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div>urged Rose. <div class="bookquote">` The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But, can you--oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose.
<p/>The surgeon shook his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) head, in a manner which intimated that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) feared it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But even if he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) has been wicked,'  (<font color='red'><b>the patient</b></font>)</div>pursued Rose, <div class="bookquote">`think how young he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) is; think that he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) may never have known a mother's love, or the comfort of a home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) to herd with men who have forced him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) to guilt.
<p/>Aunt, dear aunt, for mercy's sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick child to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) chances of amendment.
<p/>as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have done so, and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) before it is too late!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>My dear love,' said the elder lady, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) folded the weeping girl to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bosom, <div class="bookquote">`do you think I would harm a hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) head?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>No, surely,' said the old lady; `my days are drawing to their close: and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others!
<p/>Oh! ` <div class="bookquote">` Oh, no!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose, eagerly. <div class="bookquote">` What can I do to save him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>), sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Let me think, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`let me think.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Losberne thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) pockets, and took several turns up and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) toes, and frowning frightfully.
<p/>After various exclamations of <div class="bookquote">`I've got it now'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">`no, I haven't,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and as many renewals of the walking and frowning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows: <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles, and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it.
<p/>Giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) in a thousand ways, and reward him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) for being such a good shot besides.
<p/>You don't object to that?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Maylie. <div class="bookquote">` There is no other,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then my aunt invests you with full power,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said Rose, smiling through her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) tears; <div class="bookquote">`but pray don't be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>No other, take my word for it.' ` <div class="bookquote">` You seem to think,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>retorted the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`that everybody is disposed to be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose.
<p/>I only hope, for the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that I might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for doing so, as the present.'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>returned Rose, blushing. <div class="bookquote">` Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, laughing heartily, <div class="bookquote">`that is no very difficult matter.
<p/>But to return to this boy. The great point of our agreement is yet to come. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will wake in an hour or so,
<p/>I dare say; and although I have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) musn't be moved or spoken to, on peril of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life, I think we may converse with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) without danger.
<p/>Now I make this stipulation--that I shall examine him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in your presence, and that, if, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) says, we judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is a real and thorough bad one -LRB-which is more than possible-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shall be left to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fate, without any farther interference on my part, at all events.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor matter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Oh no, aunt!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>entreated Rose. <div class="bookquote">` Oh yes, aunt!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">` Is is a bargain?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cannot be hardened in vice,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose; <div class="bookquote">`It is impossible.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake.
<p/>The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily.
<p/>It was evening, indeed, before the kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to.
<p/>The boy was very ill, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) deemed it better to give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the opportunity, than to insist upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) remaining quiet until next morning: which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should otherwise have done.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Very good,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>retorted the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition.'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>The conference was a long one.
<p/>It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/>Oh! if when we oppress and grind our fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep testimony of dead men's voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day's life brings with it!
<p/>Oliver told them all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) simple history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength. Oliver's pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness and virtue watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) slept.
<p/>The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes, and condemning them for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr. Giles.
<p/>And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen; so into the kitchen he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) went.
<p/>There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament, the women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker -LRB-who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day, in consideration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) services-RRB-, and the constable.
<p/>The latter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and large half-boots; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale--as indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had.
<p/>The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) presence of mind, when the doctor entered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) hand, was corroborating everything, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) superior said it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) felt calm and happy, and could have died without a murmur. Sit still!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brittles</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Misses wished some ale to be given out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir, and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among 'em here.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr. Giles's condescension.
<p/>Mr. Giles looked round with a patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) would never desert them. `
<p/>Thank you, sir, said Mr. Giles. <div class="bookquote">` How is the patient to-night, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>asked Giles. <div class="bookquote">` So-so' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>; returned the doctor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there, Mr. Giles.'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I hope you don't mean to say, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Giles, trembling, <div class="bookquote">`that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)'s going to die.
<p/>If I thought it, I should never be happy again. I wouldn't cut a boy off: no, not even Brittles here; not for all the plate in the county, sir.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` That's not the point,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, mysteriously. <div class="bookquote">` Mr. Giles, are you a Protestant?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, sir, I hope so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And what are you , boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, turning sharply upon Brittles. <div class="bookquote">` Lord bless me, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied Brittles, starting violently; <div class="bookquote">`I'm the same as Mr. Giles, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Are you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night?
<p/>Then tell me this,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`both of you, both of you! Out with it! Come! We are prepared for you!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger, that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction. `
<p/>said the doctor, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the bridge of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy's utmost acuteness. `
<p/>The constable looked as wise as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could, and took up his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) staff of office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Pay attention to the reply, constable, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the chimney-corner</b></font>)</div>Something may come of this before long.' It's a simple question of identity, you will observe,' said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That's what it is, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the constable, coughing with great violence; for he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) ale in a hurry, and some of it had gone the wrong way. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Here's the house broken into,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`and a couple of men catch one moment's glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke, and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness.
<p/>a boy comes to that very same house, next morning, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) happens to have his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--by doing which, they place his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life in great danger--and swear he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is the thief.
<p/>Now, the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in what situation do they place themselves?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor couple</b></font>)</div><p/>Here's The constable nodded profoundly. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, if that wasn't law, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would be glad to know what was. <div class="bookquote">` I ask you again,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thundered the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`are you, on your solemn oaths, able to identify that boy?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at Brittles; the constable put his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) hand behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) ear, to catch the reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at the same moment, the sound of wheels. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's the runners!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved. <div class="bookquote">` The what?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) turn. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The Bow Street officers, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied Brittles, taking up a candle; <div class="bookquote">`me and Mr. Giles sent for 'em this morning.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Brittles; <div class="bookquote">`I sent a message up by the coachman, and I only wonder they weren't here before, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the doctor. <div class="bookquote">` You did, did you? Then confound your--slow coaches down here; that's all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, walking away.
<p/>` inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand. `
<p/>CHAPTER XXXI INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION <div class="bookquote">`Who's that? Open the door,'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>replied a man outside; <div class="bookquote">`it's the officers from Bow Street, as was sent to to-day.'
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in, without saying anything more, and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived there. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Just send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the officer; `he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)'s in the gig, a-minding the prad.
<p/>Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building, the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion to put up the gig: while Brittles lighted them, in a state of great admiration.
<p/>This done, they returned to the house, and, being shown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed like what they were.
<p/>The man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close; half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes.
<p/>Have you got a coach <div class="bookquote">`us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?'  (<font color='red'><b>a coach</b></font>)</div>The other was a red-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a rather ill-favoured countenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said the stouter man, smoothing down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table. `
<p/>This was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) appearance; that gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and shut the door. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh! Good-evening, master. Can I have a word or two with you in private, if you please?'  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>This is the lady of the house,' said Mr. Losberne, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie.
<p/>Being desired to sit down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) hat on the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same.
<p/>The latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society, or quite so much at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ease in it--one of the two--seated himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stick into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mouth, with some embarrassment. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mr. Blathers made a bow. Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,'  (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman head</b></font>)</div>said Blathers. <div class="bookquote">` What are the circumstances?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>Mr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at great length, and with much circumlocution.
<p/>I can't say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,' said Blathers; `but my opinion at once is,--I don't mind committing myself to that
<p/>Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod. <div class="bookquote">` extent,--that this wasn't done by a yokel; eh, Duff?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div><p/>And, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a countryman?' said Mr. Losberne, with a smile. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Certainly not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>replied Duff. <div class="bookquote">` That's it, master,'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>replied Blathers. <div class="bookquote">` This is all about the robbery, is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` All,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking on?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said Blathers. <div class="bookquote">` Nothing at all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>One of the frightened servants chose to take it into his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head, that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had something to do with this attempt to break into the house; but it's nonsense: sheer absurdity.'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) says is quite correct,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observed Blathers, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head in a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if they were a pair of castanets. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Wery easy disposed of, if it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>remarked Duff. <div class="bookquote">` Who is the boy? What account does he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) give of himself?
<p/>Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) come from? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't drop out of the clouds, did he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), master?'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Of course not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two ladies. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I know his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) whole history: but we can talk about that presently. You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves made their attempt, I suppose?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Certainly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Blathers. <div class="bookquote">` We had better inspect the premises first, and examine the servants afterwards. That's the usual way of doing business.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div><p/>Lights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by the native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short, went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in at the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with; and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with.
<p/>This done, amidst the breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr. Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous night's adventures: which they performed some six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one important respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the last.
<p/>This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared the room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine, would be mere child's play.
<p/>Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Upon my word,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, making a halt, after a great number of very rapid turns, <div class="bookquote">`I hardly know what to do.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Surely,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Rose, <div class="bookquote">`the poor child's story, faithfully repeated to these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I doubt it, my dear young lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't think it would exonerate him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), either with them, or with legal functionaries of a higher grade. What is he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), after all, they would say?
<p/>A runaway. Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) story is a very doubtful one.'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You believe it, surely?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>interrupted Rose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for doing so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>rejoined the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`but I don't think it is exactly the tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>because, viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) can only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why not?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>demanded Rose. <div class="bookquote">` Because, my pretty cross-examiner,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor: <div class="bookquote">` Confound the fellows, they will have the why and the wherefore, and will take nothing for granted.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own showing, you see, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has been the companion of thieves for some time past; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has been carried to a police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman's pocket; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman's house, to a place which he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has not the remotest idea.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is brought down to Chertsey, by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), whether he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) will or no; and is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing that would set him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) all to rights, there rushes into the way, a blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>)!
<p/>I see it, of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied Rose, smiling at the doctor's impetuosity; <div class="bookquote">`but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the poor child.'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>As if on purpose to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) doing any good for himself! Don't you see all this?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`of course not!
<p/>They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any question; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to them.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Having given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pockets, and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The more I think of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`the more I see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy's real story.
<p/>I am certain it will not be believed; and even if they can do nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in the end, still the dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan of rescuing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) from misery.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Bless the bright eyes of your sex! <div class="bookquote">` Oh! what is to be done?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>cried Rose. <div class="bookquote">` Dear, dear! why did they send for these people?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>All I know is,' said Mr. Losberne, at last: sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness, `that we must try and carry it off with a bold face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Maylie. <div class="bookquote">` I would not have had them here, for the world.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse.
<p/>The boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and is in no condition to be talked to any more; that's one comfort.
<p/>We must make the best of it; and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours. Come in!'
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, master,' said Blathers, entering the room followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) colleague, and making the door fast, before he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said any more. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Blathers, turning to them, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor's, <div class="bookquote">`when the servants is in it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` This warn't a put-up thing.'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And what the devil's a put-up thing?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>demanded the doctor, impatiently. ` <div class="bookquote">` Nobody suspected them, in this case,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Wery likely not, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>replied Blathers; <div class="bookquote">`but they might have been in it, for all that.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` More likely on that wery account,'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>said Duff. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We find it was a town hand,'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>said Blathers, continuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Duff</b></font>) report; <div class="bookquote">`for the style of work is first-rate.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Wery pretty indeed it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remarked
<p/>There was two of 'em in it,' continued Blathers; <div class="bookquote">`and they had a boy with 'em; that's plain from the size of the window.
<p/>We'll see this lad that you've got upstairs at once, if you please.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Perhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor face</b></font>)</div>said the doctor: his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). `
<p/>Duff, in an undertone. <div class="bookquote">` That's all to be said at present. Oh! to be sure!'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Rose, eagerly. <div class="bookquote">` You shall have it immediately, if you will.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>that's handy, miss; don't put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.' <div class="bookquote">`What shall it be?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>asked the doctor, following the young lady to the sideboard. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, thank you, miss!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Blathers, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) coat-sleeve across his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mouth; <div class="bookquote">`it's dry work, this sort of duty. Anythink A little drop of spirits, master, if it's all the same,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Blathers. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's a cold ride from London, ma'am; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who received it very graciously.
<p/>Ah!' said Mr. Blathers: not holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) wine-glass by the stem, but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) left hand: and placing it in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) chest; <div class="bookquote">`I have seen a good many pieces of business like this, in my time, ladies.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div><p/>While it was being conveyed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>), the doctor slipped out of the room. ` <div class="bookquote">` That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Duff, assisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Duff</b></font>) colleague's memory. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That was something in this way, warn't it?'  (<font color='red'><b>colleague</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Blathers; <div class="bookquote">`that was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You always gave that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>)'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>replied Duff. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It was the Family Pet, I tell you. Conkey hadn't any more to do with it than I had.'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Get out!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Blathers; <div class="bookquote">`I know better.
<p/>Do you mind that time when Conkey was robbed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) money, though? What a start that was! Better than any novel-book I ever see!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What was that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>inquired Rose: anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors. <div class="bookquote">` It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down upon,'  (<font color='red'><b>the visitors</b></font>)</div>said Blathers. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This here Conkey Chickweed--'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Conkey means Nosey, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>interposed Duff. <div class="bookquote">` Of course the lady knows that, don't she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Duff</b></font>)</div>demanded Mr. Blathers. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This here Conkey Chickweed, miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) had a cellar, where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in, for I've seen 'em off`en.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) warn't one of the family, at that time; and one night he (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) bedroom in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) eye, who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the robbery, jumped slap out of window: which was only a story high.
<p/>Always interrupting, you are, partner! He (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) was wery quick about it. But Conkey was quick, too; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) fired a blunderbuss arter him (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>), and roused the neighbourhood.
<p/>They set up a hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about 'em, found that Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost 'em.
<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr. Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don't know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state of mind about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or four days, a pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be going to make away with himself.
<p/>One day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and orders Jem Spyers in -LRB-Jem was a active officer-RRB-, and tells him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chickweed</b></font>) house.
<p/>'' I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Chickweed</b></font>), Spyers,'' said Chickweed, ``pass my house yesterday morning, '' ``Why didn't you up, and collar him (<font color='blue'><b>Chickweed</b></font>)!'' says Spyers.
<p/>I was so struck all of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,'' says the poor man;
<p/>Spyers no sooner heard this, than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put some clean linen and a comb, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket, in case he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have to stop a day or two; and away he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes, and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment's notice.
<p/>'' ``but we're sure to have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); for between ten and eleven o'clock at night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed again. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out, ``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!
<p/>Away goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars out, ``Thieves!'' and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time, like mad.
<p/>Spyers loses sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a minute as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turns a corner; shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; ``Which is the man?''
<p/>Stop thief! Murder! '' Jem Spyers dashes out; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full cry. ``D--me!'' says Chickweed, ``I've lost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again!
<p/>Next morning, Spyers took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old place, and looked out, from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye, till his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own two eyes ached again.
<p/>At last, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't help shutting 'em, to ease 'em a minute; and the very moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hears Chickweed a-roaring out, ``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!''
<p/>Off he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) starts once more, with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and after twice as long a run as the yesterday's one, the man's lost again!
<p/>This was done, once or twice more, till one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with him (<font color='blue'><b>Chickweed</b></font>) arterwards; and the other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What did Jem Spyers say?'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' It was a remarkable occurrence, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chickweed</b></font>) warn't to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the public-house. inquired the doctor; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Jem Spyers,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>resumed the officer, <div class="bookquote">`for a long time said nothing at all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) understood his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) business.
<p/>But, one morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) walked into the bar, and taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) snuffbox, says ``Chickweed, I've found out who done this here robbery.
<p/>'' ``Have you?'' said Chickweed. '' Oh, my dear Spyers, only let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented! Oh, my dear Spyers, where is the villain!''
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) had; and a good bit of money he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) had made by it, too; and nobody would never have found it out, if he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) hadn't been so precious anxious to keep up appearances!'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Blathers, putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) wine-glass, and clinking the handcuffs together.
<p/>``Come!'' said Spyers, offering him (<font color='blue'><b>Blathers</b></font>) a pinch of snuff, ``none of that gammon! You did it yourself. '' <div class="bookquote">` Very curious, indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>observed the doctor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, if you please, you can walk upstairs.'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`If you please, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Blathers. Closely following Mr. Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver's bedroom; Mr. Giles preceding the party, with a lighted candle.
<p/>Being assisted by the doctor, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward--in fact, without seeming to recollect where he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was, or what had been passing. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence notwithstanding, <div class="bookquote">`this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>ye-call-him's grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand: who has placed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.'
<p/>Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had appeared yet. Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was thus recommended to their notice.
<p/>The bewildered butler gazed from them towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You don't mean to deny that, I suppose?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, laying Oliver gently down again. <div class="bookquote">` It was all done for the--for the best, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>answered Giles. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn't have meddled with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). I am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Thought it was what boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>inquired the senior officer. <div class="bookquote">` The housebreaker's boy, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>replied Giles. <div class="bookquote">` They--they certainly had a boy.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Well? Do you think so now?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquired Blathers. <div class="bookquote">` Think what, now?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>replied Giles, looking vacantly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) questioner. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Think it's the same boy, Stupid-head?'  (<font color='red'><b>questioner</b></font>)</div>rejoined Blathers, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">` I don't know; I really don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Giles, with a rueful countenance. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I couldn't swear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What do you think?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Blathers. <div class="bookquote">` I don't know what to think,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Blathers</b></font>)</div>replied poor Giles. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't think it is the boy; indeed, I'm almost certain that it isn't. You know it can't be.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Has this man been a-drinking, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>inquired Blathers, turning to the doctor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient's pulse during this short dialogue; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked, that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would perhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them.
<p/>Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on anything, but the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) own strong mystification; except, indeed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) declarations that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brittles</b></font>) shouldn't know the real boy, if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were put before him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that instant; that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had only taken Oliver to be he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), because Mr. Giles had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) began to be very much afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had been a little too hasty.
<p/>Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had fired, it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before.
<p/>What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said Duff, addressing Mr. Giles, with supreme contempt. Upon no one, however, did it make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself;
<p/>who, after labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost.
<p/>Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next morning.
<p/>With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff journeyed accordingly.
<p/>The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King's subjects, held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence, that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise as they went.
<p/>In short, after some more examination, and a great deal more conversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver's appearance if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded with a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great Mr. Conkey Chickweed.
<p/>If fervent prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in heaven--and if they be not, what prayers are!--the blessings which the orphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing peace and happiness.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXII OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) KIND FRIENDS Oliver's ailings were neither slight nor few.
<p/>In addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb, his (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague: which hung about him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) for many weeks, and reduced him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) sadly.
<p/>But, at length, he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) began, by slow degrees, to get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words, how deeply he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ardently he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) hoped that when he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) grew strong and well again, he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) could do something to show his (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) gratitude; only something, which would let them see the love and duty with which his (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) breast was full; something, however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whole heart and soul. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne. Poor fellow!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pale lips; <div class="bookquote">`you shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will.
<p/>The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and beauties of spring, will restore you in a few days.
<p/>We are going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us. We will employ you in a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`The trouble!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>dear lady, if I could but work for you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or watching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make you happy; what would I give to do it!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>You shall give nothing at all,' said Miss Maylie, smiling; <div class="bookquote">`for, as I told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make me very happy indeed.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh! ` <div class="bookquote">` Happy, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver; <div class="bookquote">`how kind of you to say so!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`You will make me happier than I can tell you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the young lady. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>To think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence, would delight me, more than you can well imagine.
<p/>Do you understand me?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) inquired, watching Oliver's thoughtful face. <div class="bookquote">` Oh yes, ma'am, yes!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver eagerly; <div class="bookquote">` but I was thinking that I am ungrateful now.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` To whom?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired the young lady. <div class="bookquote">` To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care of me before,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am sure they would,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>rejoined Oliver's benefactress; <div class="bookquote">`and Mr. Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) will carry you to see them.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver benefactress</b></font>)</div><p/>If they knew how happy I am, they would be pleased, I am sure.' ` <div class="bookquote">` Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>), ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face brightening with pleasure. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once again!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition.
<p/>One morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) and Mr. Losberne set out, accordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie. When they came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a loud exclamation. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What's the matter with the boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried the doctor, as usual, all in a bustle. <div class="bookquote">` Do you see anything--hear anything--feel anything--eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window. <div class="bookquote">` That house!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes; well, what of it? Stop coachman.
<p/>Pull up here,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the doctor. <div class="bookquote">` What of the house, my man; eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`The thieves--the house they took me to!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>whispered Oliver. `
<p/>But, before the coachman could dismount from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) box, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had tumbled out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Halloa?'  (<font color='red'><b>a madman</b></font>)</div>said a little ugly hump-backed man: opening the door so suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) last kick, nearly fell forward into the passage. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The devil it is!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the doctor. <div class="bookquote">` Hallo, there! let me out!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>What's the matter here?' <div class="bookquote">` Matter!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the other, collaring him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), without a moment's reflection. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A good deal. Robbery is the matter.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`There'll be Murder the matter, too,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the hump-backed man, coolly, <div class="bookquote">`if you don't take your hands off.
<p/>Do you hear me?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I hear you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) captive a hearty shake. <div class="bookquote">` Where's--confound the fellow, what's his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) rascally name--Sikes; that's it.
<p/>The hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and indignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor's grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the house.
<p/>Where's Sikes, you thief?'  (<font color='red'><b>captive</b></font>)</div>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed into the parlour, without a word of parley.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the cupboards; answered Oliver's description! <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the hump-backed man, who had watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keenly, `what do you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way?
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair, you ridiculous old vampire?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the irritable doctor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do you want to rob me, or to murder me? Which is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>What do you want, then?' demanded the hunchback. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`As soon as I think proper,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to Oliver's account of it.
<p/>Will you take yourself off, before I do you a mischief? Curse you!' <div class="bookquote">` I shall find you out, some day, my friend.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the cripple</b></font>)</div>sneered the ill-favoured cripple. ` If you ever want me, I'm here. I haven't lived here mad and all alone, for five-and-twenty years, to be scared by you.
<p/>And so saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell, and danced upon the ground, as if wild with rage. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You shall pay for this; you shall pay for this.'  (<font color='red'><b>the demon</b></font>)</div>Stupid enough, this,' muttered the doctor to himself; <div class="bookquote">`the boy must have made a mistake.
<p/>Here! Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself up again.'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>With these words he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) flung the hunchback a piece of money, and returned to the carriage.
<p/>The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the driver, he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not forget it for months afterwards.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until the driver had resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) seat; and when they were once more on their way, they could see him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) some distance behind: beating his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) feet upon the ground, and tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) hair, in transports of real or pretended rage. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am an ass!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, after a long silence. <div class="bookquote">` Did you know that before, Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, sir.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then don't forget it another time.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` An ass,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor again, after a further silence of some minutes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Even if it had been the right place, and the right fellows had been there, what could I have done, single-handed?
<p/>And if I had had assistance, I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my own exposure, and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I have hushed up this business.
<p/>That would have served me right, though. I am always involving myself in some scrape or other, by acting on impulse.
<p/>Now, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) life, and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/>If the truth must be told, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver's story on the very first occasion on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had a chance of obtaining any.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) soon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver's replies to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mind to attach full credence to them, from that time forth.
<p/>It might have done me good.'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided, they were enabled to drive straight thither.
<p/>When the coach turned into it, his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) heart beat so violently, that he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) could scarcely draw his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) breath. <div class="bookquote">` Now, my boy, which house is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Losberne. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That! That!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window. <div class="bookquote">` The white house. Oh! make haste! Pray make haste! I feel as if I should die: it makes me tremble so.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Come, come!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the good doctor, patting him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) on the shoulder. <div class="bookquote">` You will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh! I hope so!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` They were so good to me; so very, very good to me.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>The coach rolled on.
<p/>It stopped. No; that was the wrong house; the next door. It went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver looked up at the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face.
<p/>Alas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window. <div class="bookquote">` To Let.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Knock at the next door,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver's arm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the adjoining house, do you know?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>The servant did not know; but would go and inquire.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) presently returned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) goods, and gone to the West Indies, six weeks before.
<p/>Oliver clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands, and sank feebly backward. <div class="bookquote">` Has his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) housekeeper gone too?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Losberne, after a moment's pause. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, sir' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>; replied the servant. <div class="bookquote">` The old gentleman, the housekeeper, and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow's, all went together.'  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then turn towards home again,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Losberne to the driver; <div class="bookquote">`and don't stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded London!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` The book-stall keeper, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` I know the way there. See him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), pray, sir! Do see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If we go to the book-stall keeper's, we shall certainly find that he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) is dead, or has set his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) house on fire, or run away.
<p/>My poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">` Quite enough for both of us. No; home again straight!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) happiness; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had pleased himself, many times during his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>): and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), and in bewailing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) cruel separation from them.
<p/>The hope of eventually clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had been forced away, had buoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) up, and sustained him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), under many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) recent trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so far, and carried with them the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was an impostor and a robber--a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) dying day--was almost more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) could bear.
<p/>And in obedience to the doctor's impulse, home they went. The circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) benefactors.
<p/>After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather had fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house at Chertsey, for some months.
<p/>Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin's cupidity, to the banker's; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house, they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took Oliver with them.
<p/>Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green hills and rich woods, of an inland village!
<p/>Who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close and noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded hearts!
<p/>Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature's face; and, carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being.
<p/>Crawling forth, from day to day, to some green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded from their dim and feeble sight!
<p/>Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved: may purify our thoughts, and bear down before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it.
<p/>The memories which peaceful country scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes. It was a lovely spot to which they repaired.
<p/>Oliver, whose days had been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and brawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there.
<p/>The rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls ; the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours.
<p/>Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh turf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at rest.
<p/>Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mother lay, would sometimes sit him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) down and sob unseen; but, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes to the deep sky overhead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would cease to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as lying in the ground, and would weep for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), sadly, but without pain.
<p/>The days were peaceful and serene; the nights brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched prison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts.
<p/>Every morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) went to a white-headed old gentleman, who lived near the little church: who taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to read better, and to write: and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could never try enough to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would walk with Mrs. Maylie and Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters.
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would work hard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) with them: listening with such pleasure to all they said: and so happy if they wanted a flower that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could run to fetch: that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could never be quick enough about it.
<p/>When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) aunt to hear.
<p/>There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a perfect rapture.
<p/>And when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever spent it yet!
<p/>There was the little church, in the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows: the birds singing without: and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance.
<p/>The poor people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and sounded more musical -LRB-to Oliver's ears at least-RRB- than any he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever heard in church before.
<p/>Then, there were the walks as usual, and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver read a chapter or two from the Bible, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been studying all the week, and in the performance of which duty he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt more proud and pleased, than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been the clergyman himself.
<p/>In the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o'clock, roaming the fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild flowers, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would return laden, home; and which it took great care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the embellishment of the breakfast-table.
<p/>There was fresh groundsel, too, for Miss Maylie's birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the cages, in the most approved taste.
<p/>When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare cricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which Oliver -LRB-who had studied this science also, under the same master, who was a gardener by trade,-RRB- applied himself with hearty good-will, until Miss Rose made her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) appearance: when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) had done.
<p/>So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled happiness, and which, in Oliver's were true felicity.
<p/>With the purest and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest, soul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of that short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) niece, and that the fervent attachment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment to, himself.
<p/>It was a happy time. and how happily too; like all the other days in that most happy time! CHAPTER XXXIII WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>OLIVER</b></font>) FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES
<p/>A SUDDEN CHECK Spring flew swiftly by, and summer came. If the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness.
<p/>The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine, which lay stretched beyond.
<p/>The earth had donned her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mantle of brightest green; and shed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) richest perfumes abroad. It was the prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing.
<p/>Oliver had long since grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) warm feelings of a great many people.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was still the same gentle, attached, affectionate creature that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been when pain and suffering had wasted his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) strength, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was dependent for every slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>One beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them: for the day had been unusually warm, and there was a brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was unusually refreshing.
<p/>Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds.
<p/>Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates. Mrs. Maylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly home.
<p/>After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) played it, they heard a sound as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) were weeping. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The young lady merely throwing off her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) simple bonnet, sat down to the piano as usual. Rose, my dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the elder lady.
<p/>Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words had roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) from some painful thoughts. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Rose, my love!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` What is this? In tears! My dear child, what distresses you?'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't know what it is; I can't describe it; but I feel--'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not ill, my love?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>interposed Mrs. Maylie. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nothing, aunt; nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>replied the young lady. <div class="bookquote">` No, no! Oh, not ill!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) spoke; `I shall be better presently.
<p/>The young lady, making an effort to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune; but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fingers dropped powerless over the keys.
<p/>Covering her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was now unable to repress. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Close the window, pray!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Oliver hastened to comply with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) request. My child!' said the elderly lady, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`I never saw you so before.'
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>rejoined Rose; <div class="bookquote">`but indeed I have tried very hard, and cannot help this.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) countenance had changed to a marble whiteness.
<p/>Its expression had lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn before.
<p/>I fear I am ill, aunt.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush: and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye.
<p/>Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); but seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) affected to make light of them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) endeavoured to do the same, and they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) aunt to retire for the night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) was in better spirits; and appeared even in better health: assuring them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) felt certain she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) should rise in the morning, quite well. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Again this disappeared, like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) was once more deadly pale. I hope,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, <div class="bookquote">`that nothing is the matter?
<p/>The old lady motioned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) not to speak; and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) don't look well to-night, but--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>At length, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, in a trembling voice: <div class="bookquote">`I hope not, Oliver. I have been very happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for some years: too happy, perhaps.
<p/>It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune; but I hope it is not this.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The heavy blow,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, <div class="bookquote">`of losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>` Oh! God forbid! ` exclaimed Oliver, hastily. <div class="bookquote">` Amen to that, my child!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Two hours ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was quite well.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is very ill now,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Maylies; `and will be worse, I am sure.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and to beg, earnestly, that, for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be more calm. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And consider, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes, despite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) efforts to the contrary. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My dear, dear Rose! Oh, what shall I do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Oh! consider how young and good she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) is, and what pleasure and comfort she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) gives to all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>).
<p/>I am sure--certain--quite certain--that, for your sake, who are so good yourself; and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) own; and for the sake of all she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) makes so happy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) will not die.
<p/>Heaven will never let her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) die so young.' <div class="bookquote">` Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) hand on Oliver's head. <div class="bookquote">` You think like a child, poor boy.
<p/>I had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned, for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love.
<p/>I have seen enough, too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow; for Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy.
<p/>Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself up as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) spoke, became composed and firm.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the care and watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>), steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully.
<p/>But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding. God's will be done! I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>); and He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knows how well!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under trying circumstances.
<p/>How should he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), when their possessors so seldom know themselves? An anxious night ensued. When morning came, Mrs. Maylie's predictions were but too well verified.
<p/>We must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,' said Mrs. Maylie, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) finger on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) lip, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) looked steadily into his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) face; <div class="bookquote">`this letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to Mr. Losberne.
<p/>It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more than four miles off, by the footpath across the field: and thence dispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey.
<p/>The people at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to see it done, I know.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever. ` Oliver could make no reply, but looked his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) anxiety to be gone at once. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Here is another letter,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; `but whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I scarcely know.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is it for Chertsey, too, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>inquired Oliver; impatient to execute his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) commission, and holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) trembling hand for the letter. `
<p/>Oliver glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire, at some great lord's house in the country; where, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) could not make out. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>No,' replied the old lady, giving it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) mechanically. Shall it go, ma'am?
<p/>` asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">` I think not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back. <div class="bookquote">` I will wait until to-morrow.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) gave Oliver her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) purse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) started off, without more delay, at the greatest speed he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could muster.
<p/>Swiftly he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work: nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stop once, save now
<p/>and then, for a few seconds, to recover breath, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) came, in a great heat, and covered with dust, on the little market-place of the market-town.
<p/>There were a white bank, and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was a large house, with all the wood about it painted green: before which was the sign of <div class="bookquote">`The George.'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after hearing what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wanted, referred him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to the ostler; who after hearing all he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had to say again, referred him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to the landlord; who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) teeth with a silver toothpick.
<p/>This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill: which took a long time making out: and after it was ready, and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which took up ten good minutes more.
<p/>Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to the next stage.
<p/>At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery, the man set spurs to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse, and rattling over the uneven paving of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along the turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes.
<p/>As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a somewhat lighter heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was turning out of the gateway when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at that moment coming out of the inn door. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) paused, and looked about for the inn. To this he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hastened, as soon as it caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eye. Hah!'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>cried the man, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes on Oliver, and suddenly recoiling. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I beg your pardon, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver; <div class="bookquote">`I was in a great hurry to get home, and didn't see you were coming.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>What the devil's this?' ` <div class="bookquote">` Death!'  (<font color='red'><b>the devil</b></font>)</div>muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) large dark eyes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Who would have thought it! Grind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to ashes! He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am sorry,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man's wild look. <div class="bookquote">` I hope I have not hurt you!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Rot you!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clenched teeth; <div class="bookquote">`if I had only had the courage to say the word, I might have been free of you in a night.
<p/>Curses on your head, and black death on your heart, you imp! What are you doing here?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>The man shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fist, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uttered these words incoherently.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), but fell violently on the ground: writhing and foaming, in a fit.
<p/>Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman -LRB-for such he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) supposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to be-RRB-; and then darted into the house for help.
<p/>Having seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) safely carried into the hotel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face homewards, running as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could, to make up for lost time: and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had just parted.
<p/>The circumstance did not dwell in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) recollection long, however: for when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mind, and to drive all considerations of self completely from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) memory.
<p/>A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in constant attendance upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); and after first seeing the patient, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) disorder to be one of a most alarming nature. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) was delirious. In fact,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`it would be little short of a miracle, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) recovered.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>How often did Oliver start from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bed that night, and stealing out, with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber!
<p/>How often did a tremble shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) frame, and cold drops of terror start upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) brow, when a sudden trampling of feet caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had even then occurred!
<p/>And what had been the fervency of all the prayers he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever muttered, compared with those he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) poured forth, now, in the agony and passion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave's verge!
<p/>Oh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance!
<p/>the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety to be doing something to relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time, allay them!
<p/>People spoke in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time; women and children went away in tears.
<p/>All the livelong day, and for hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the garden, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay stretched inside.
<p/>It is hard,' said the good doctor, turning away as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) spoke; <div class="bookquote">`so young; so much beloved; but there is very little hope.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy, surrounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting fast.
<p/>Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), in silence.
<p/>There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy raised his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), that this was not a time for death; that Rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that graves were for cold and cheerless winter: not for sunlight and fragrance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds.
<p/>Oh! Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived. ` Another morning. A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts.
<p/>Another! Again! It was tolling for the funeral service. A group of humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse was young.
<p/>They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother--a mother once--among the weeping train. But the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang on.
<p/>Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had received from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might never cease showing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) how grateful and attached he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of thought, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) service; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) might have been more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been.
<p/>We need be careful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so little done--of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might have been repaired!
<p/>There is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this, in time.
<p/>Oliver's heart sank at sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>); for she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had never left the bedside of her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) niece; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) trembled to think what change could have driven her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) learnt that she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had fallen into a deep sleep, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell, and die.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour. They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours.
<p/>The untasted meal was removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere, they watched the sun as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sank lower and lower, and, at length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) departure.
<p/>Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep. They both involuntarily darted to the door, as Mr. Losberne entered. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What of Rose?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady. <div class="bookquote">` Tell me at once! I can bear it; anything but suspense! Oh, tell me!
<p/>in the name of Heaven!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`You must compose yourself,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor supporting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Be calm, my dear ma'am, pray.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Let me go, in God's name! My dear child! She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) is dead! She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) is dying!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the doctor, passionately. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The lady fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knees, and tried to fold her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands together; but the energy which had supported her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) so long, fled up to Heaven with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) first thanksgiving; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>As He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is good and merciful, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will live to bless us all, for years to come.'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXXIV CONTAINS SOME
<p/>INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER
<p/>It was almost too much happiness to bear. Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not weep, or speak, or rest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of tears came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) relief, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) seemed to awaken, all at once, to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) breast.
<p/>The night was fast closing in, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) returned homeward: laden with flowers which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of the sick chamber.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) walked briskly along the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heard behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace.
<p/>Looking round, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) saw that it was a post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as the horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap, whose face seemed familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), although his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) view was so brief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not identify the person.
<p/>In another second or two, the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop: which he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) did, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) could pull up his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) horses.
<p/>Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same voice called Oliver by his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) name. <div class="bookquote">` Here!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried the voice. `
<p/>Giles popped out his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oliver, what's the news? Miss Rose! Master O-li-ver!'  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Is it you, Giles?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door. In a word!' cried the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`Better or worse?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Better--much better!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, hastily. <div class="bookquote">` Thank Heaven!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` You are sure?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Quite, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. `
<p/>The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door, leaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) aside. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The change took place only a few hours ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>You are quite certain?
<p/>There is no possibility of any mistake on your part, my boy, is there?' demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I would not for the world, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. `
<p/>Indeed you may believe me. Mr. Losberne's words were, that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would live to bless us all for many years to come.
<p/>The tears stood in Oliver's eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face away, and remained silent, for some minutes.
<p/>Oliver thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sob, more than once; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feared to interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) by any fresh remark--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could well guess what his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) feelings were--and so stood apart, feigning to be occupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) nosegay.
<p/>All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with white spots.
<p/>That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) regarded the young gentleman, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) turned round and addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) say so.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I think you had better go on to my mother's in the chaise, Giles,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">` I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time before I see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). You can say I am coming.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` I beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said Giles: giving a final polish to his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It wouldn't be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should never have any more authority with them if they did.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>but if you would leave the postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you. <div class="bookquote">` Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, <div class="bookquote">`you can do as you like.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us. Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering, or we shall be taken for madmen.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Giles, reminded of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) unbecoming costume, snatched off and pocketed his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) took out of the chaise.
<p/>This done, the postboy drove off; Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure. As they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) seemed about five-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) countenance was frank and handsome; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) demeanor easy and prepossessing.
<p/>Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had not already spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mother.
<p/>Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) son when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) reached the cottage. The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mother!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>whispered the young man; <div class="bookquote">`why did you not write before?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I did,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Maylie; <div class="bookquote">`but, on reflection, I determined to keep back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne's opinion.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But why,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said the young man, <div class="bookquote">`why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened? If Rose had--I cannot utter that word now--if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have forgiven yourself!
<p/>If that had been the case, Harry,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie, <div class="bookquote">`I fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little import.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/>How could I ever have know happiness again!' ` <div class="bookquote">` And who can wonder if it be so, mother?'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>rejoined the young man; <div class="bookquote">`or why should I say, if ?
<p/>mother--you must know it!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie; <div class="bookquote">`I know that the devotion and affection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and lasting.
<p/>If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed behaviour in one she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) loved would break her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) heart, I should not feel my task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I think, my dear son,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) shoulder, <div class="bookquote">`that youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more fleeting.
<p/>Above all, I think'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said the lady, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son's face, <div class="bookquote">`that if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children also: and, in exact proportion to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) success in the world, be cast in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth, and made the subject of sneers against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may, no matter how generous and good his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature, one day repent of the connection he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) formed in early life.
<p/>--It is--it is--you know it, This is unkind, mother,'  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">` And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may have the pain of knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) does so.'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mother,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, impatiently, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be a selfish brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe, who acted thus.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>The mental agony I have suffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have lightly formed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` You think so now, Harry,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">` And ever will!'  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said the young man. <div class="bookquote">` On Rose, sweet, gentle girl!
<p/>I have no thought, no view, no hope in life, beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and if you oppose me in this great stake, you take my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind.
<p/>Mother, think better of this, and of me, and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little.'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Harry,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie, <div class="bookquote">`it is because I think so much of warm and sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded.
<p/>my heart is set, as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman. But we have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Let it rest with Rose, then,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>interposed Harry. <div class="bookquote">` You will not press these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle in my way?'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I will not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Maylie; <div class="bookquote">`but I would have you consider--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I have considered!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>was the impatient reply; <div class="bookquote">`Mother, I have considered, years and years.
<p/>My feelings remain unchanged, as they ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent, which can be productive of no earthly good?
<p/>I have considered, ever since I have been capable of serious reflection. No! Before I leave this place, Rose shall hear me.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) will hear me coldly, mother,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shall,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie. <div class="bookquote">` Not coldly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>rejoined the old lady; <div class="bookquote">`far from it.'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` How then?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>urged the young man. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) has formed no other attachment?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother; <div class="bookquote">`you have, or I mistake, too strong a hold on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) affections already.
<p/>Before you stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child, on Rose's history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) doubtful birth may have on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) decision: devoted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) is to us, with all the intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of self which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) characteristic.'  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What I would say,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>resumed the old lady, stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was about to speak, <div class="bookquote">`is this. What do you mean?'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` That I leave you to discover,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Maylie. <div class="bookquote">` I must go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>).

(<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>And pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son's hand, affectionately, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hastened from the room.
<p/>Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding. The former now held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them.
<p/>The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious questions from his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) young friend, a precise account of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) patient's situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as Oliver's statement had encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened with greedy ears. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Have you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>inquired the doctor, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) had concluded. <div class="bookquote">` Nothing particular, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">` None at all, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`I am sorry to hear it, because you do that sort of thing admirably. Pray, how is Brittles?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy is very well, sir,' said Mr. Giles, recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) usual tone of patronage; <div class="bookquote">`and sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) respectful duty, sir.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div><p/>Seeing you here, reminds me, Mr. Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small commission in your favour.
<p/>Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder, and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on the termination of which, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) made a great many bows, and retired with steps of unusual stateliness.
<p/>The subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and having called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty, which was highly effective, that it had pleased his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) mistress, in consideration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of five-and-twenty pounds, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) sole use and benefit.
<p/>At this, the two women-servants lifted up their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr. Giles, pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) shirt-frill, replied, <div class="bookquote">`No, no' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>; and that if they observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) was at all haughty to his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) inferiors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) would thank them to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) so.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) made a great many other remarks, no less illustrative of his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) humility, which were received with equal favour and applause, and were, withal, as original and as much to the purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are.
<p/>Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful Harry Maylie might have been at first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) was not proof against the worthy gentleman's good humour, which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of small jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had ever heard, and caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to laugh proportionately; to the evident satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and made Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy.
<p/>So, they were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they could well have been; and it was late before they retired, with light and thankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need.
<p/>Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) usual occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had known for many days.
<p/>The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty.
<p/>The melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over every object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic.
<p/>The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright.
<p/>` <div class="bookquote">` That's well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">` Just step into this corner a moment, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>Such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects.
<p/>Men who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts.
<p/>It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) morning expeditions were no longer made alone.
<p/>Harry Maylie, after the very first morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) met Oliver coming laden home, was seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in their arrangement, as left his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) young companion far behind.
<p/>If Oliver were behindhand in these respects, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knew where the best were to be found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and brought home the fairest that blossomed.
<p/>The window of the young lady's chamber was opened now; for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loved to feel the rich summer air stream in, and revive her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with its freshness; but there always stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch, which was made up with great care, every morning.
<p/>Oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away, although the little vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) help observing, that whenever the doctor came into the garden, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) invariably cast his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head most expressively, as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) set forth on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) morning's walk.
<p/>The real hues are delicate, and need a clearer vision. Pending these observations, the days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering.
<p/>Nor did Oliver's time hang heavy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hands, although the young lady had not yet left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now and then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) applied himself, with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old gentleman, and laboured so hard that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) quick progress surprised even himself.
<p/>It was while he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was engaged in this pursuit, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence.
<p/>The little room in which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was accustomed to sit, when busy at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) books, was on the ground-floor, at the back of the house.
<p/>It was quite a cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the place with their delicious perfume.
<p/>It looked into a garden, whence a wicket-gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine meadow-land and wood. There was no other dwelling near, in that direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive.
<p/>One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) books.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had been uncommonly sultry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had exerted himself a great deal
<p/>, it is no disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say, that gradually and by slow degrees, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fell asleep.
<p/>There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure.
<p/>So far as an overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two.
<p/>It is an undoubted fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead, yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the mere silent presence of some external object; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes: and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness.
<p/>Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own little room; that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) books were lying on the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside.
<p/>Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thought, with a glow of terror, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was in the Jew's house again.
<p/>There sat the hideous old man, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accustomed corner, pointing at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and whispering to another man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face averted, who sat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nor is this, the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was asleep. Hush, my dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard the Jew say; <div class="bookquote">`it is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sure enough.
<p/>If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exact shape, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to point him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out.
<p/>If you buried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fifty feet deep, and took me across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn't a mark above it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay buried there?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>Come away.' <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the other man seemed to answer; `could I mistake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), think you? The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver awoke with the fear, and started up.
<p/>what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heart, and deprived him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) voice, and of power to move!
<p/>There--there--at the window--close before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)--so close, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could have almost touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) started back: with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) eyes peering into the room, and meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>): there stood the Jew!
<p/>And beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), white with rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the inn-yard.
<p/>But they had recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) them; and their look was as firmly impressed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) memory, as if it had been deeply carved in stone, and set before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) birth.
<p/>Good Heaven! It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes; and they were gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood transfixed for a moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called loudly for help.
<p/>When the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver's cries, hurried to the spot from which they proceeded, they found him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), pale and agitated, pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely able to articulate the words, <div class="bookquote">`The Jew! the Jew!'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard Oliver's history from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mother, understood it at once. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>CHAPTER XXXV CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER'S ADVENTURE; AND A CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE What direction did he (<font color='blue'><b>MAYLIE</b></font>) take?'
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>MAYLIE</b></font>) asked, catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner. <div class="bookquote">` That,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; <div class="bookquote">`I missed them in an instant.'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sprang over the hedge, and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Giles followed as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) could; and Oliver followed too; and in the course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking himself up with more agility than he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) could have been supposed to possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting all the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter.
<p/>On they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader, striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to communicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit.
<p/>Then, they are in the ditch!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">` Follow! And keep as near me, as you can.'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>The search was all in vain.
<p/>They stood now, on the summit of a little hill, commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles.
<p/>There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time.
<p/>A thick wood skirted the meadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There were not even the traces of recent footsteps, to be seen. It must have been a dream, Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry Maylie.
<p/>Oh no, indeed, sir,' replied Oliver, shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretch's countenance; `I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) too plainly for that.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>` Who was the other? ` inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the inn,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` We had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I could swear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They took this way?'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>demanded Harry: <div class="bookquote">`are you sure?'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`As I am that the men were at the window,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, pointing down, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from the meadow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew, running a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The two gentlemen watched Oliver's earnest face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke, and looking from him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) said.
<p/>Still, in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight. The grass was long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had crushed it.
<p/>The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but in no one place could they discern the print of men's shoes, or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance.
<p/>Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village, furnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers.
<p/>Of these, the Jew was, at all events, sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been seen drinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.
<p/>This is strange!'  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">` Strange?'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>echoed the doctor. <div class="bookquote">` Blathers and Duff, themselves, could make nothing of it.'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>On the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but with no better success.
<p/>On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie repaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless.
<p/>After a few days, the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when wonder, having no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) room: was able to go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into the hearts of all.
<p/>But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon some there: even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to remark.
<p/>Mrs. Maylie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) son were often closeted together for a long time; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) face.
<p/>After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) departure to Chertsey, these symptoms increased; and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady, and of somebody else besides.
<p/>At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour, Harry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to speak with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) for a few moments. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Meanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering. A few--a very few--will suffice, Rose,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said the young man, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What I shall have to say, has already presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.'
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Rose had been very pale from the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entrance; but that might have been the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) recent illness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) merely bowed; and bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to proceed. <div class="bookquote">` I--I--ought to have left here, before,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Forgive me for saying so, but I wish you had.'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man; <div class="bookquote">`the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed.
<p/>We know that when the young, the beautiful, and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know, Heaven help us! that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade in blooming.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bent, and glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as though the outpouring of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fresh young heart, claimed kindred naturally, with the loveliest things in nature. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A creature,'  (<font color='red'><b>kindred</b></font>)</div>continued the young man, passionately, <div class="bookquote">`a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of God's own angels, fluttered between life and death.
<p/>You should, indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied Rose. <div class="bookquote">` You had been dying; trembling between earth and heaven. Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) was akin,
<p/>Rose, Rose, to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved you--these were distractions almost too great to bear.
<p/>They were mine, by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears, and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in its course.
<p/>Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a high and rushing tide.
<p/>I have watched you change almost from death, to life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection.
<p/>Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has softened my heart to all mankind.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I did not mean that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, weeping; <div class="bookquote">`I only wish you had left here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to pursuits well worthy of you.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There is no pursuit more worthy of me: more worthy of the highest nature that exists: than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said the young man, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>half opened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) view, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) would return to the sorrow and calamity of this! You recovered. Rose, my own dear Rose!
<p/>For years--for years--I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share; thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy moment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy's attachment, and claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us!
<p/>That time has not arrived; but here, with not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer.'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, mastering the emotions by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) was agitated. <div class="bookquote">` As you believe that I am not insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It is,' replied Rose, `that you must endeavour to forget me; not as your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply; but, as the object of your love.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` It is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Look into the world; think how many hearts you would be proud to gain, are there.
<p/>Confide some other passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most faithful friend you have.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) face with one hand, gave free vent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) tears.
<p/>Harry still retained the other. <div class="bookquote">` And your reasons, Rose,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, at length, in a low voice; <div class="bookquote">`your reasons for this decision?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You have a right to know them,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>rejoined Rose. <div class="bookquote">` You can say nothing to alter my resolution. It is a duty that I must perform.
<p/>I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless, girl, with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and fastened myself, a clog, on all your hopes and projects.
<p/>I owe it to you and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your generous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>I owe it, alike to others, and to myself.' <div class="bookquote">`To yourself?'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>` Yes, Harry. <div class="bookquote">`If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty--'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>Harry began. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They do not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>replied Rose, colouring deeply. <div class="bookquote">` Then you return my love?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">` Say but that, dear Rose; say but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) I loved,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>rejoined Rose, <div class="bookquote">`I could have--'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Have received this declaration very differently?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do not conceal that from me, at least, Rose.'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I could,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose. <div class="bookquote">` Stay!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) added, disengaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">`why should we prolong this painful interview?
<p/>Most painful to me, and yet productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it will be happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness.
<p/>As we have met to-day, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined; and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper you!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Farewell, Harry! Another word, Rose,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">` Your reason in your own words. From your own lips, let me hear it!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><p/>All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life, are in store for you.
<p/>But those connections are proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) who has so well supplied that mother's place.
<p/>In a word,' said the young lady, turning away, as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) temporary firmness forsook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), `there is a stain upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` The prospect before you,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>answered Rose, firmly, <div class="bookquote">`is a brilliant one. I will carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest alone on me.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If I had been less--less fortunate, the world would call it--if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny--if I had been poor, sick, helpless--would you have turned from me then?
<p/>Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given this scruple birth?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Do not press me to reply,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>answered Rose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>One word more, Rose. Dearest Rose! one more!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>cried Harry, throwing himself before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>). ` The question does not arise, and never will.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>retorted Harry, <div class="bookquote">`it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the path before me.
<p/>It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the utterance of a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else.
<p/>Oh, Rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name of all I have suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer me this one question!'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then, if your lot had been differently cast,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>rejoined Rose; <div class="bookquote">`if you had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement, and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I should have been spared this trial.
<p/>It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>I have every reason to be happy, very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.'
<p/>Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded into the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said Rose, extending her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">` I must leave you now, indeed.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Once, and only once more,--say within a year, but it may be much sooner,--I may speak to you again on this subject, for the last time.'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I ask one promise,' said Harry. ` <div class="bookquote">`Not to press me to alter my right determination,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose, with a melancholy smile; <div class="bookquote">`it will be useless.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not seek, by word or act, to change it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then let it be so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>rejoined Rose; <div class="bookquote">`it is but one pang the more, and by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>But the young man caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom; and imprinting one kiss on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) beautiful forehead, hurried from the room.
<p/>No,' said Harry; `to hear you repeat it, if you will--finally repeat it! She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) extended her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) hand again. CHAPTER XXXVI IS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS PLACE,
<p/>BUT IT SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST, AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES `
<p/>And so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning; eh? ` said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) and Oliver at the breakfast-table. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, you are not in the same mind or intention two half-hours together!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`You will tell me a different tale one of these days,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>said Harry, colouring without any perceptible reason.
<p/>I hope I may have good cause to do so,' replied Mr. Losberne; <div class="bookquote">`though I confess I don't think I shall.
<p/>But yesterday morning you had made up your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea-side.
<p/>Before noon, you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I go, on your road to London.
<p/>And at night, you urge me, with great mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) breakfast when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds.
<p/>Too bad, isn't it, Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and Mr. Maylie went away, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>rejoined Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The great nobs,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>replied Harry, `under which designation, I presume, you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year,
<p/><div class="bookquote">` That's a fine fellow,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the doctor; <div class="bookquote">`you shall come and see me when you return. is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>But of course they will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor fellow</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`you are a queer fellow. There's something in that. Good training is always desirable, whether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor fellow</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry Maylie looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little; but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) contented himself with saying, <div class="bookquote">`We shall see,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and pursued the subject no farther.
<p/>The post-chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good doctor bustled out, to see it packed. `
<p/>Oliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>); much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) whole behaviour displayed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">`let me speak a word with you.'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>You can write well now?' said Harry, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I hope so, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` I shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would write to me--say once
<p/>a fort-night: every alternate Monday: to the General Post Office in London. Will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Oliver, greatly delighted with the commission. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I should like to know how--how my mother and Miss Maylie are,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the young man; <div class="bookquote">`and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take, and what you talk about, and whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>)--they, I mean--seem happy and quite well.
<p/>I would rather you did not mention it to them,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Harry, hurrying over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) words; <div class="bookquote">`because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>You understand me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh! quite, sir, quite,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Let it be a secret between you and me; and mind you tell me everything!
<p/>Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) importance, faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) communications.
<p/>The doctor was in the chaise; Giles -LRB-who, it had been arranged, should be left behind-RRB- held the door open in his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) hand; and the women-servants were in the garden, looking on.
<p/>I depend upon you.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>Mr. Maylie took leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>), with many assurances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) regard and protection. Harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window, and jumped into the carriage. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Halloa!'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great hurry, and shouting to the postillion; <div class="bookquote">`something very short of flying will keep pace with me .
<p/>Drive on!'  (<font color='red'><b>the postillion</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">`hard, fast, full gallop! Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me, to-day.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Do you hear?'
<p/>Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible, and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound its way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly disappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects, or the intricacies of the way, permitted.
<p/>And there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away; for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) from view when Harry raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seems in high spirits and happy,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) said, at length. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down Rose's face, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) sat pensively at the window, still gazing in the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.
<p/>I feared for a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might be otherwise. I was mistaken. I am very, very glad.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXXVII IN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST,
<p/>Mr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which were sent back from its cold and shining surface.
<p/>A paper fly-cage dangled from the ceiling, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) occasionally raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes in gloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) countenance.
<p/>Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might be that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) own past life.
<p/>NOT UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASES Nor was Mr. Bumble's gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator.
<p/>There were not wanting other appearances, and those closely connected with his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) own person, which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) affairs.
<p/>The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they? He (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) still wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) nether limbs; but they were not the breeches.
<p/>The coat was wide-skirted; and in that respect like the coat, but, oh how different! The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one.
<p/>There are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more substantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them.
<p/>Mr. Bumble was no longer a beadle. A field-marshal has his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) uniform; a bishop his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) silk apron; a counsellor his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) silk gown;
<p/>a beadle his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cocked hat. Strip the bishop of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) apron, or the beadle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat and lace; what are they?
<p/>Men. Mere men. Dignity, and even holiness too, sometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine. Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse.
<p/>Another beadle had come into power. On him (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) the cocked hat, gold-laced coat, and staff, had all three descended. <div class="bookquote">` And to-morrow two months it was done!'  (<font color='red'><b>staff</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh. `
<p/>Mr. Bumble might have meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh--there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I sold myself,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection, `for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small quantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Cheap!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble's ear: <div class="bookquote">`you would have been dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows that!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) interesting consort, who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) had overheard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It seems a age.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I went very reasonable. Cheap, dirt cheap!' Mrs. Bumble, ma'am!' said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>cried the lady. <div class="bookquote">` Have the goodness to look at me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).
<p/>-LRB-If she (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) stands such a eye as that,' said Mr. Bumble to himself, <div class="bookquote">`she (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) can stand anything. It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers.
<p/>Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle glances; are matters of opinion.
<p/>The matter of fact, is, that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble's scowl, but, on the contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.
<p/>If it fails with her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>), my power is gone.' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>-RRB- On hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first incredulous, and afterwards amazed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) then relapsed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) former state; nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) rouse himself until his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) attention was again awakened by the voice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) partner. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>partner</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble; <div class="bookquote">`and although I was not snoring, I shall snore, gape, sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my prerogative.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>inquired Mrs. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` Your prerogative!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable contempt. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I said the word, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` The prerogative of a man is to command.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And what's the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Corney</b></font>)</div>cried the relict of Mr. Corney deceased. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>To obey, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Corney</b></font>)</div>thundered Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` Your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) might have been alive now.
<p/>Mrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now arrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) dropped into a chair, and with a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a paroxysm of tears.
<p/>I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was, poor man!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble's soul; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) heart was waterproof.
<p/>Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) own power, pleased and exalted him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) good lady with looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should cry her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hardest: the exercise being looked upon, by the faculty, as strongly conducive to health. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and softens down the temper,'  (<font color='red'><b>the faculty</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` So cry away.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man might, who felt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had asserted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) superiority in a becoming manner, thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with much ease and waggishness depicted in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole appearance.
<p/>Now, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less troublesome than a manual assault; but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Corney</b></font>) was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in discovering.
<p/>The first proof he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat to the opposite end of the room.
<p/>This preliminary proceeding laying bare his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head, the expert lady, clasping him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) tightly round the throat with one hand, inflicted a shower of blows -LRB-dealt with singular vigour and dexterity-RRB- upon it with the other.
<p/>This done, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) created a little variety by scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) face, and tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hair; and, having, by this time, inflicted as much punishment as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) deemed necessary for the offence, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) over a chair, which was luckily well situated for the purpose: and defied him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) to talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) prerogative again, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) dared. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Get up!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command. <div class="bookquote">` And take yourself away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance: wondering much what something desperate might be. Picking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) looked towards the door. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Are you going?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>demanded Mrs. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` Certainly, my dear, certainly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker motion towards the door. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You are so very violent, that really I--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>At this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle.
<p/>Mr. Bumble immediately darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) unfinished sentence: leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full possession of the field.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had a decided propensity for bullying: derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was -LRB-it is needless to say-RRB- a coward.
<p/>This is by no means a disparagement to his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) character; for many official personages, who are held in high respect and admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities.
<p/>The remark is made, indeed, rather in his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) favour than otherwise, and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) qualifications for office.
<p/>I didn't intend to--I'm going, my dear! Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten. But, the measure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) degradation was not yet full.
<p/>After making a tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their wives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be visited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen: when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Hem!'  (<font color='red'><b>the paupers</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) native dignity. ` These women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative.
<p/>With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner: which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lady wife. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Hallo! hallo there! What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?'  (<font color='red'><b>lady wife</b></font>)</div>My dear,' said Mr. Bumble, <div class="bookquote">` I didn't know you were here.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble: glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse-master's humility. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Didn't know I was here!'  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>repeated Mrs. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` What do you do here?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You thought they were talking too much?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What business is it of yours?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why, my dear--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>urged Mr. Bumble submissively. <div class="bookquote">` What business is it of yours?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>demanded Mrs. Bumble, again. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's very true, you're matron here, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>submitted Mr. Bumble; <div class="bookquote">`but I thought you mightn't be in the way just then.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>You're a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that don't concern you, making everybody in the house laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day.
<p/>Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated for an instant.
<p/>Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught up a bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) towards the door, ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) instantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) portly person.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,'  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lady. <div class="bookquote">` We don't want any of your interference. Be off; come!'  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>What could Mr. Bumble do?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) looked dejectedly round, and slunk away; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was degraded in their eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had lost caste and station before the very paupers; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master, but everybody else's, so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned, and now!--'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was too much.
<p/>Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had reached the portal in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) reverie-RRB-; and walked, distractedly, into the street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated the first passion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) thirsty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) passed a great many public-houses; but, at length paused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary customer.
<p/>It wanted but this. All in two months!' said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts. ` Two months! It began to rain, heavily, at the moment.
<p/>Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had looked from the street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain haggardness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) look, as well as by the dusty soils on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) dress, to have travelled some distance.
<p/>This determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>). The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large cloak. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyed Bumble askance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered, but scarcely deigned to nod his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head in acknowledgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) salutation.
<p/>Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar: so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) gin-and-water in silence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.
<p/>It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall into company under such circumstances: that Mr. Bumble felt, every now and then, a powerful inducement, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) could not resist, to steal a look at the stranger: and that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).
<p/>Mr. Bumble's awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the stranger's eye, which was keen and bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold.
<p/>When they had encountered each other's glance several times in this way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Were you looking for me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`when you peered in at the window?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Not that I am aware of, unless you're Mr.--'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mr. Bumble stopped short; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was curious to know the stranger's name, and thought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) impatience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) might supply the blank. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I see you were not,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mouth; <div class="bookquote">`or you have known my name.
<p/>You don't know it. I would recommend you not to ask for it.'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger expression</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I meant no harm, young man,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Bumble, majestically. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And have done none,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said the stranger. Another silence succeeded this short dialogue: which was again broken by the stranger. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You were differently dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should know you again.
<p/>I have seen you before, I think?'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` You were beadle here, once; were you not?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I was,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; <div class="bookquote">`porochial beadle.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Just so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>rejoined the other, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">` It was in that character I saw you. What are you now?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div><p/>Master of the workhouse,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble's eyes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) raised them in astonishment at the question. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Master of the workhouse, young man!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Don't scruple to answer freely, man. I know you pretty well, you see.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I suppose, a married man,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, shading his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident perplexity, <div class="bookquote">`is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) can, than a single one.
<p/>Porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/>The stranger smiled, and nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) head again: as much to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had not mistaken his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) man; then rang the bell. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Fill this glass again,'  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said, handing Mr. Bumble's empty tumbler to the landlord. <div class="bookquote">` Let it be strong and hot.
<p/>You like it so , I suppose?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not too strong,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough. <div class="bookquote">` You understand what that means, landlord!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, drily.
<p/>The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr. Bumble's eyes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I came down to this place, to-day, to find you out; and, by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) friends sometimes, you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you were uppermost in my mind.
<p/>Now listen to me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, after closing the door and window. ` I want some information from you. I don't ask you to give it for nothing, slight as it is.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without.
<p/>When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much satisfaction, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">`Carry your memory back--let me see--twelve years, last winter.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Put up that, to begin with.' <div class="bookquote">` It's a long time,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` Very good. I've done it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves--gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and hid their shame, rot 'em in the grave!'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The scene, the workhouse.' <div class="bookquote">`Good!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And the time, night.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Yes.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">`The lying-in room, I suppose?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, not quite following the stranger's excited description. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger. <div class="bookquote">` A boy was born there.'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` A many boys,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head, despondingly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A murrain on the young devils!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>cried the stranger; `I speak of one; a meek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a coffin-maker--I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) coffin, and screwed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) body in it--and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, you mean Oliver! Young Twist!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble; <div class="bookquote">`I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>), of course. There wasn't a obstinater young rascal--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's not of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) I want to hear; I've heard enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor Oliver's vices. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's of a woman; the hag that nursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) mother. Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered facetious. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It would be hard to tell. There's no midwifery there, whichever place she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s gone to; so I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s out of employment, anyway.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>The man looked fixedly at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given this information, and although he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not withdraw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes for some time afterwards, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed lost in thought.
<p/>For some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared doubtful whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breathed more freely; and withdrawing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, observed that it was no great matter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` What do you mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>demanded the stranger, sternly. <div class="bookquote">` That she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died last winter,'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble. With that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) rose, as if to depart.
<p/>But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) at once saw that an opportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) better half.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) well remembered the night of old Sally's death, which the occurrences of that day had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) good reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had proposed to Mrs. Corney; and although that lady had never confided to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) the disclosure of which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been the solitary witness, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman's attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist.
<p/>Hastily calling this circumstance to mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) informed the stranger, with an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) died; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) had reason to believe, throw some light on the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Twist</b></font>) inquiry. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>How can I find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, thrown off his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) guard; and plainly showing that all his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) fears -LRB-whatever they were-RRB- were aroused afresh by the intelligence. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>At nine in the evening,'  (<font color='red'><b>guard</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, producing a scrap of paper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water-side, in characters that betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) agitation; <div class="bookquote">`at nine in the evening, bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to me there.
<p/>Only through me,'  (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` When?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>cried the stranger, hastily. <div class="bookquote">` To-morrow,'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>rejoined Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` I needn't tell you to be secret.
<p/>With these words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk.
<p/>Shortly remarking that their roads were different, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night.
<p/>It's your interest.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>On glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name. The stranger had not gone far, so he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) made after him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) to ask it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What do you want?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) on the arm. <div class="bookquote">` Following me?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Only to ask a question,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, pointing to the scrap of paper. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What name am I to ask for?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Monks!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>rejoined the man; and strode hastily, away. CHAPTER XXXVIII CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR.
<p/>The clouds, which had been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half, or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon the river.
<p/>They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might, perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain, and sheltering them from observation.
<p/>The husband carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as though--the way being dirty--to give his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife the benefit of treading in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heavy footprints.
<p/>They went on, in profound silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) pace, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head as if to make sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) helpmate was following; then, discovering that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was close at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) heels, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) mended his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) rate of walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards their place of destination.
<p/>This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime.
<p/>It was a collection of mere hovels: some, hastily built with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for the most part, within a few feet of the river's bank.
<p/>A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it: and here and there an oar or coil of rope: appeared, at first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a passer-by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with any view to their being actually employed.
<p/>In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of some kind.
<p/>AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND MR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW It was a dull, close, overcast summer evening. It had, in its day, probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements.
<p/>The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving itself in the same fate.
<p/>It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring violently down. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But it had long since gone to ruin. The place should be somewhere here,'  (<font color='red'><b>the couple</b></font>)</div>said Bumble, consulting a scrap of paper he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hand. `
<p/>Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) head and descried a man looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Halloa there!'  (<font color='red'><b>a man breast-high</b></font>)</div>cried a voice from above. Stand still, a minute,' cried the voice; <div class="bookquote">`I'll be with you directly.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With which the head disappeared, and the door closed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then, mind what I told you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron: <div class="bookquote">`and be careful to say as little as you can, or you'll betray us at once.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) was prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near which they stood, and beckoned them inwards. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Is that the man?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Bumble's good lady. Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative. <div class="bookquote">` Come in!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) cried impatiently, stamping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) foot upon the ground. `
<p/>Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind, followed: obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) chief characteristic. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?'  (<font color='red'><b>chief</b></font>)</div>said Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had bolted the door behind them. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't keep me here!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any other invitation. We--we were only cooling ourselves,' stammered Bumble, looking apprehensively about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>). `
<p/>Not all the rain that ever fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell's fire out, as a man can carry about with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>With this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and bent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gaze upon her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>), till even she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>), who was not easily cowed, was fain to withdraw her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) eyes, and turn them towards the ground. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Cooling yourselves!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>retorted Monks. <div class="bookquote">` You won't cool yourself so easily; don't think it!'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>This is the woman, is it?' demanded Monks. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said the matron, interposing, and returning, as she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) spoke, the searching look of Monks. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Hem! That is the woman,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wife's caution. <div class="bookquote">` I know they will always keep one till it's found out,'  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said Monks. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So, by the same rule, if a woman's a party to a secret that might hang or transport her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), I'm not afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) telling it to anybody; not I!
<p/>And what may that be?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked the matron. <div class="bookquote">` The loss of their own good name,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>replied Monks. <div class="bookquote">` Do you understand, mistress?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his (<font color='blue'><b>anybody</b></font>) two companions, and again beckoning them to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>anybody</b></font>), the man hastened across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the roof.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder, leading to another floor of warehouses above: when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed, which shook the crazy building to its centre. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">` Of course you don't!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Monks. <div class="bookquote">` How should you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>Hear it!'
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, shrinking back. ` Hear it! Rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands suddenly from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr. Bumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I hate the sound!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>These fits come over me, now and then,' said Monks, observing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) alarm; `and thunder sometimes brings them on.
<p/>Thus speaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling: and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, `the sooner we come to our business, the better for all.
<p/>The question was addressed to Bumble; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wife anticipated the reply, by intimating that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was perfectly acquainted with it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) died; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) told you something--'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`About the mother of the boy you named,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>replied the matron interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't mind me now; it's all over for this once.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The woman know what it is, does she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?' Yes.' <div class="bookquote">` The first question is, of what nature was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) communication?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That's the second,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>observed the woman with much deliberation. <div class="bookquote">` The first is, what may the communication be worth?'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Bumble: who did not want for spirit, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) yoke-fellow could abundantly testify. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Humph!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry; <div class="bookquote">`there may be money's worth to get, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Perhaps there may,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>was the composed reply. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Something that was taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks. <div class="bookquote">` Something that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wore. Something that--'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You had better bid,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mrs. Bumble. `
<p/>Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) better half into any greater share of the secret than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had originally possessed, listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes: which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) directed towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded, what sum was required for the disclosure. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have heard enough, already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>What's it worth to you?' asked the woman, as collectedly as before. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty pounds in gold,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman; <div class="bookquote">`and I'll tell you all I know.
<p/>It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied Monks. <div class="bookquote">` Speak out, and let me know which.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>Not before.' <div class="bookquote">`Five-and-twenty pounds!'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Monks, drawing back. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's not a large sum, either.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it's told!'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I spoke as plainly as I could,' replied Mrs. Bumble. ` cried Monks impatiently; <div class="bookquote">`and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value in course of time,' answered the matron, still preserving the resolute indifference she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) had assumed. `
<p/>As to lying dead, there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for anything you
<p/><div class="bookquote">` or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What if I pay it for nothing?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks, hesitating. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>submitted Mr. Bumble, in a voice tremulous with fear: <div class="bookquote">` I am here, my dear.
<p/>And besides,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) teeth chattering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">`Mr. Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons.
<p/>You can easily take it away again,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied the matron. <div class="bookquote">` I am but a woman; alone here; and unprotected.'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>Mr. Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and
<p/>; bu he (<font color='blue'><b>Monks</b></font>) has heerd: I say I have no doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear: that I am a very determined officer, with very uncommon strength, if I'm once roused.
<p/>also that I am a little run to seed, as I may say I only want a little rousing; that's all.'
<p/>As Mr. Bumble spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) made a melancholy feint of grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lantern with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed expression of every feature, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) did want a little rousing, and not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless, indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for the purpose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) had better have cut it out, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) came, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) can't speak in a lower tone,'  (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div>said Monks, grimly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You are a fool,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; <div class="bookquote">`and had better hold your tongue.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` So! He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s your husband, eh?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought as much, when you came in,' rejoined Monks, marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spouse as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke. `
<p/>So much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people, when I find that there's only one will between them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told out twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the woman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`gather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder, which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let's hear your story.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) face from the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say.
<p/>The faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to render her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whisper audible.
<p/>The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in the extreme. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) my husband!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>tittered the matron, parrying the question. <div class="bookquote">` I'm in earnest. See here!'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>When this woman, that we called old Sally, died,' the matron began, <div class="bookquote">`she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) and I were alone.'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Was there no one by?'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; <div class="bookquote">`No sick wretch or idiot in some other bed?
<p/>No one who could hear, and might, by possibility, understand?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not a soul,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>replied the woman; <div class="bookquote">`we were alone. I stood alone beside the body when death came over it.'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke of a young creature,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>resumed the matron, <div class="bookquote">`who had brought a child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room, but in the same bed, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) then lay dying.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/>Good,' said Monks, regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) attentively. <div class="bookquote">` Go on.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">`Ay?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) shoulder, <div class="bookquote">`Blood!
<p/>The child was the one you named to him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) last night,'  (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div>said the matron, nodding carelessly towards her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) husband; <div class="bookquote">`the mother this nurse had robbed.'
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>How things come about!' ` <div class="bookquote">` In life?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks. <div class="bookquote">` In death,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied the woman, with something like a shudder. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead mother had prayed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) last breath, to keep for the infant's sake.'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>How long before?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`As she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told me, with great difficulty, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had done this,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron, <div class="bookquote">`she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) fell back and died.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) sold it,' cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; `did she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) sell it? Where? When? To whom? <div class="bookquote">`Without saying more?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very suppression, seemed only the more furious. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's a lie! I'll not be played with. She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) said more. I'll tear the life out of you both, but I'll know what it was.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) didn't utter another word,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, to all appearance unmoved -LRB-as Mr. Bumble was very far from being-RRB- by the strange man's violence; <div class="bookquote">`but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which was partly closed; and when I saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dead, and so removed the hand by force
<p/>, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Which contained--'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>interposed Monks, stretching forward. <div class="bookquote">` Nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied the woman; <div class="bookquote">`it was a pawnbroker's duplicate.'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I judge that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker's interest year by year, and prevent its running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be redeemed.
<p/>Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) died with the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand.
<p/>The time was out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and so redeemed the pledge.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>For what?' demanded Monks. <div class="bookquote">` In good time I'll tell you.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said the woman. ` <div class="bookquote">` Where is it now?'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>asked Monks quickly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling hands.
<p/>There ,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied the woman. It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of hair, and a plain gold wedding-ring. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which is within a year before the child was born.
<p/>It has the word ``Agnes'' engraved on the inside,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman. <div class="bookquote">` I found out that.'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And this is all?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet. `
<p/>Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) were glad to find that the story was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty pounds back again; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) nose, unchecked, during the whole of the previous dialogue. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; <div class="bookquote">`and
<p/>All,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied the woman. I want to know nothing; for it's safer not. But I may ask you two questions, may I?' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You may ask,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Monks, with some show of surprise; <div class="bookquote">`but whether I answer or not is another question.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`--Which makes three,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of facetiousness. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Is that what you expected to get from me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>demanded the matron. <div class="bookquote">` It is,'  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>replied Monks. <div class="bookquote">` The other question?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What do you propose to do with it?
<p/>Can it be used against me?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Never,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks either</b></font>)</div>rejoined Monks; <div class="bookquote">`nor against me either. See here! But don't move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Monks either</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened close at Mr. Bumble's feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward, with great precipitation. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Look down,'  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf. <div class="bookquote">` Don't fear me. I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were seated over it, if that had been my game.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same.
<p/>The turbid water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles.
<p/>There had once been a water-mill beneath; the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If you flung a man's body down there, where would it be to-morrow morning?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Monks drew the little packet from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hurriedly thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream.
<p/>Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Bumble, recoiling at the thought. It fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely audible splash; and was gone.
<p/>The three looking into each other's faces, seemed to breathe more freely. <div class="bookquote">` There!'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back into its former position. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If the sea ever gives up its dead, as books say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash among it.
<p/>We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant party.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`By all means,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am not afraid of your wife.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`You may depend upon me, young man,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Bumble, bowing himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You'll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Monks, with a threatening look. <div class="bookquote">` On everybody's account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>remarked Monks. <div class="bookquote">` Light your lantern! And get away from here as fast as you can.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr. Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now carried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse, descended in silence, followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wife.
<p/>Monks brought up the rear, after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the rushing of the water.
<p/>They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks started at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) lantern a foot above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) figure: looking nervously about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for hidden trap-doors.
<p/>The gate at which they had entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside.
<p/>They were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below.
<p/>Bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) go first, and bear the light, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) returned to the chamber he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had just quitted. CHAPTER XXXIX INTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS
<p/>On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.
<p/>The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of those he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great distance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) former lodgings.
<p/>It was not, in appearance, so desirable a habitation as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) old quarters: being a mean and badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty lane.
<p/>Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman's having gone down in the world of late: for a great scarcity of furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen, bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration.
<p/>The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) white great-coat, by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week's growth.
<p/>The dog sat at the bedside: now eyeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) master with a wistful look, and now pricking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) attention.
<p/>Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber's ordinary dress, was a female: so pale and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) replied to Mr. Sikes's question. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS TOGETHER Not long gone seven,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said the girl.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` How do you feel to-night, Bill?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`As weak as water,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes and limbs. `
<p/>Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes's temper; for, as the girl raised him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) up and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) to a chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) muttered various curses on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) awkwardness, and struck her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Whining are you?' said Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Come!
<p/>Don't stand snivelling there. If you can't do anything better than that, cut off altogether. D'ye hear me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I hear you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face aside, and forcing a laugh. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What fancy have you got in your head now?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh! you've thought better of it, have you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>growled Sikes, marking the tear which trembled in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eye. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, you don't mean to say, you'd be hard upon me to-night, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Such a number of nights,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, with a touch of woman's tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice: <div class="bookquote">`such a number of nights as I've been patient with you, nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the first that I've seen you like yourself; you wouldn't have served me as you did just now, if you'd thought of that, would you?
<p/>All the better for you, you have.'  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>No!' cried Mr. Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Why not?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Come, come; say you wouldn't.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, then,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Sikes, <div class="bookquote">`I wouldn't. Why, damme, now, the girls's whining again!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` It's nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, throwing herself into a chair. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't you seem to mind me. It'll soon be over.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What'll be over?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What foolery are you up to, now, again? Get up and bustle about, and don't come over me with your woman's nonsense.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/>At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really weak and exhausted, dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head over the back of the chair, and fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which, on similar occasions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was accustomed to garnish his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) threats.
<p/>Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon emergency; for Miss Nancy's hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance; Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual, called for assistance. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What's the matter here, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, looking in. <div class="bookquote">` Lend a hand to the girl, can't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes impatiently. `
<p/>With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl's assistance, while Mr. John Dawkins -LRB-otherwise the Artful Dodger-RRB-, who had followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) was laden; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) heels, uncorked it in a twinkling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) teeth, and poured a portion of its contents down the patient's throat: previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,'  (<font color='red'><b>the patient</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Dawkins; <div class="bookquote">`and you slap her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the petticuts.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dawkins/Mr. John Dawkins/John</b></font>)</div><p/>These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially that department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry: were not long in producing the desired effect.
<p/>The girl gradually recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face upon the pillow: leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and I've brought something good with me, that you'll be glad to see.
<p/>Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on, this morning.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the comers</b></font>)</div><p/>In compliance with Mr. Fagin's request, the Artful untied this bundle, which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed the articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Sitch a rabbit pie, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing to view a huge pasty; <div class="bookquote">`sitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there's no occasion to pick 'em;
<p/>half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it'll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea-pot off;
<p/>a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didn't work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness,--oh no!
<p/>Two half-quartern brans; pound of best fresh; piece of double Glo`ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort you ever lushed!'
 (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Uttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) extensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while Mr. Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) carried: which the invalid tossed down his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) throat without a moment's hesitation. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't stand chattering and grinning at me!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) asked Fagin. <div class="bookquote">` Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hands with great satisfaction. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`I might have been done for, twenty times over, afore you'd have done anything to help me.
<p/>You'll do, Bill; you'll do now.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>What do you mean by leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted wagabond?'
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Only hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), boys!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR.

(<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The things is well enough in their way,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Sikes: a little soothed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) glanced over the table; `but what have you got to say for yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health, blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this mortal time, than if I was that <div class="bookquote">`ere dog.--Drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) down, Charley!'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I never see such a jolly dog as that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>cried Master Bates, doing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was desired. <div class="bookquote">` Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market!

<p/>What have you got to say for yourself, you withered old fence, eh?'  (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And what about the other fortnight?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>demanded Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` What about the other fortnight that you've left me lying here, like a sick rat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hole?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I couldn't help it, Bill. I can't go into a long explanation before company; but I couldn't help it, upon my honour.'
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Cut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out of my mouth, or it'll choke me dead.' <div class="bookquote">`Don't be out of temper, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>urged Fagin, submissively. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Upon your what?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. <div class="bookquote">` Here! I have never forgot you, Bill; never once.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No! I'll pound it that you han't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes, with a bitter grin. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You've been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) got well: and was quite poor enough for your work.
<p/>If it hadn't been for the girl, I might have died.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` There now, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR.

<p/>If it hadn't been for the girl! Who but poor ould Fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>Nancy's appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys, receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) with liquor: of which, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) took very sparingly; while Fagin, assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better temper, by affecting to regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) threats as a little pleasant banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) condescended to make. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) says true enough there!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Nancy, coming hastily forward. <div class="bookquote">` Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) be; let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) be.'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>It's all very well,' said Mr. Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>but I must have some blunt from you to-night.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I haven't a piece of coin about me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then you've got lots at home,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>retorted Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`and I must have some from there.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Lots!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin, holding up is hands. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't know how much you've got, and I dare say you hardly know yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I haven't so much as would--'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` but I must have some to-night; and that's flat.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well, well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, with a sigh, <div class="bookquote">`I'll send the Artful round presently.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>The Artful's a deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) way, or get dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you put him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) up to it.
<p/>Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all sure; and I'll lie down and have a snooze while she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)'s gone.'
<p/>After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly remarking that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) couldn't get any more he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) must accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) home; with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard.
<p/>The Jew then, taking leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) affectionate friend, returned homeward, attended by Nancy and the boys: Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady's return.
<p/>In due course, they arrived at Fagin's abode, where they found Toby Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage, which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and with it, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) young friends.
<p/>Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) inferior in station and mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hat to go. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` You won't do nothing of the kind,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Has nobody been, Toby?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>asked Fagin. <div class="bookquote">` Not a living leg,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) collar; <div class="bookquote">`it's been as dull as swipes.
<p/>Damme, I'm as flat as a juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn't had the good natur'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>to amuse this youngster.
<p/>You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin, to recompense me for keeping house so long. Horrid dull, I'm blessed if I an't!'
<p/>With these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit swept up his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) winnings, and crammed them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) waistcoat pocket with a haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) figure; this done, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that Mr. Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) legs and boots till they were out of sight, assured the company that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) didn't value his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) losses the snap of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) little finger. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Wot a rum chap you are, Tom!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Master Bates, highly amused by this declaration. <div class="bookquote">` Not a bit of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Master Bates</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Chitling. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Am I, Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`A very clever fellow, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, patting him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) on the shoulder, and winking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) other pupils. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an't he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>), Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>pupils</b></font>)</div>asked Tom. <div class="bookquote">` No doubt at all of that, my dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And it is a creditable thing to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) acquaintance; an't it, Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div>pursued Tom. <div class="bookquote">` Very much so, indeed, my dear.
<p/>They're only jealous, Tom, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) won't give it to them.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div>cried Tom, triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">`that's where it is! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has cleaned me out.
<p/>But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can't I, Fagin?'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom White</b></font>)</div>`To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up your loss at once, and don't lose any more time.
<p/>In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) vivacious friend indulging, as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar:
<p/>inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good society: and a great number of fine gentlemen -LRB-composing the good society aforesaid-RRB- who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Dodger! Charley! It's time you were on the lay. Come! It's near ten, and nothing done yet.'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>Now,' said Fagin, when they had left the room, <div class="bookquote">`I'll go and get you that cash, Nancy.
<p/>This is only the key of a little cupboard where I keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear.
<p/>It's a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I'm fond of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all.
<p/>I never lock up my money, for I've got none to lock up, my dear--ha! ha! ha!--none to lock up. Hush!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl, who was sitting at the table with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms folded, appeared in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was, came or went: until the murmur of a man's voice reached her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ears.
<p/>The instant she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) caught the sound, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tore off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under the table.
<p/>The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) muttered a complaint of the heat: in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action: which, however, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) back towards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at the time. `
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) said, hastily concealing the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) breast; <div class="bookquote">`who's that? Listen!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Bah!' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; <div class="bookquote">`it's the man I expected before; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s coming downstairs.
<p/>Laying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skinny forefinger upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lip, the Jew carried a candle to the door, as a man's step was heard upon the stairs without.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached it, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into the room, was close upon the girl before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) observed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Not a word about the money while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s here, Nance. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't stop long. Not ten minutes, my dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was Monks. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Only one of my young people,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, observing that Monks drew back, on beholding a stranger. <div class="bookquote">` Don't move, Nancy.'
 (<font color='red'><b>a stranger</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of careless levity, withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) turned towards Fagin, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if there had been any bystander to observe the change, he (<font color='blue'><b>bystander</b></font>) could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Any news?'  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>inquired Fagin. <div class="bookquote">` Great.'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR.

<p/>Not bad, any way,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied Monks with a smile. <div class="bookquote">` I have been prompt enough this time. Let me have a word with you.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room, although she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could see that Monks was pointing to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>The Jew: perhaps fearing she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might say something aloud about the money, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) endeavoured to get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>): pointed upward, and took Monks out of the room. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did not reach her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) companion to the second story.
<p/>Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house, the girl had slipped off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoes; and drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gown loosely over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head, and muffling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms in it, stood at the door, listening with breathless interest.
<p/>The moment the noise ceased, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence; and was lost in the gloom above.
<p/>The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards, the two men were heard descending.
<p/>Not that infernal hole we were in before,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could hear the man say as they went upstairs. Monks went at once into the street; and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) returned, the girl was adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone. <div class="bookquote">` Why, Nance!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nance</b></font>) put down the candle, <div class="bookquote">`how pale you are!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Pale!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>echoed the girl, shading her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, as if to look steadily at him (<font color='blue'><b>Nance</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Quite horrible. What have you been doing to yourself?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don't know how long and all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl carelessly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Come! Let me get back; that's a dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand.
<p/>When the girl got into the open street, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat down upon a doorstep; and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way.
<p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) returned, quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run.
<p/>After completely exhausting herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stopped to take breath: and, as if suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) inability to do something she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was bent upon, wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, and burst into tears.
<p/>It might be that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tears relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), or that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt the full hopelessness of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) condition; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned back; and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover lost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own thoughts: soon reached the dwelling where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had left the housebreaker.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) betrayed any agitation, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) presented herself to Mr. Sikes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had brought the money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) uttered a growl of satisfaction, and replacing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head upon the pillow, resumed the slumbers which her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arrival had interrupted.
<p/>It was fortunate for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that the possession of money occasioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) temper; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) behaviour and deportment.
<p/>That she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have taken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), that, had her (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) suspicions.
<p/>As that day closed in, the girl's excitement increased; and, when night came on, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cheek, and a fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment.
<p/>Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) glass towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when these symptoms first struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>). `
<p/>They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a <div class="bookquote">`good-night.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Why, burn my body!' said the man, raising himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stared the girl in the face. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You look like a corpse come to life again. What's the matter?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Matter!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl. <div class="bookquote">` Nothing. What do you look at me so hard for?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What foolery is this?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>demanded Sikes, grasping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) by the arm, and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) roughly. <div class="bookquote">` What is it? What do you mean?
<p/>What are you thinking of?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Of many things, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, shivering, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did so, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes. `
<p/>The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I tell you wot it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes; <div class="bookquote">`if you haven't caught the fever, and got it comin'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>on, now, there's something more than usual in the wind, and something dangerous too.
<p/>But, Lord! What odds in that?' You're not a-going to--. No, damme! you wouldn't do that!' <div class="bookquote">`Do what?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There ain't,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and muttering the words to himself; `there ain't a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I'd have cut her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) throat three months ago.
<p/>Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) physic.
<p/>The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>); and held the vessel to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) lips, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) drank off the contents. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the robber, <div class="bookquote">`come and sit aside of me, and put on your own face; or I'll alter it so, that you won't know it agin when you do want it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s got the fever coming on; that's it.' The girl obeyed. Sikes, locking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), fell back upon the pillow: turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) position restlessly; and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of rising, into a deep and heavy sleep.
<p/>The grasp of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand relaxed; the upraised arm fell languidly by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) side; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) lay like one in a profound trance. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They closed; opened again; closed once more; again opened. The laudanum has taken effect at last,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>murmured the girl, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rose from the bedside. `
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hastily dressed herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bonnet and shawl: looking fearfully round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes's heavy hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kissed the robber's lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with noiseless touch, hurried from the house.
<p/>A watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I may be too late, even now.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Has it long gone the half-hour?' asked the girl. <div class="bookquote">` It'll strike the hour in another quarter,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the man: raising his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lantern to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face. `
<p/>And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more, <div class="bookquote">` muttered Nancy: brushing swiftly past him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and gliding rapidly down the street.
<p/>Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) tracked her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) way, in making from Spitalfields towards the West-End of London.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) tore along the narrow pavement: elbowing the passengers from side to side; and darting almost under the horses'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The clock struck ten, increasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) impatience. The woman is mad!'  (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div>said the people, turning to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) rushed away.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were comparatively deserted; and here her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) hurried past.
<p/>Some quickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was hastening at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), and looked back, surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) neared her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) place of destination, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was alone.
<p/>As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) to the spot, the clock struck eleven.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute, and making up her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) mind to advance; but the sound determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) stepped into the hall.
<p/>It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park. The porter's seat was vacant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced towards the stairs. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, young woman!'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`who do you want here?'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` A lady who is stopping in this house,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>answered the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The young woman, who had by this time, noted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appearance, replied only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>A lady!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. <div class="bookquote">` What lady?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Miss Maylie,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said Nancy. To him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Nancy repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) request. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What name am I to say?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>asked the waiter. <div class="bookquote">` It's of no use saying any,'  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy. <div class="bookquote">` Nor business?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No, nor that neither,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl. <div class="bookquote">` I must see the lady.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>`Come! ` said the man, pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) towards the door. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I shall be carried out if I go!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the girl violently; <div class="bookquote">`and I can make that a job that two of you won't like to do.
<p/>Isn't there anybody here,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, looking round, <div class="bookquote">`that will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me?'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward to interfere. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>None of this. Take yourself off.'  (<font color='red'><b>the servants</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Take it up for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), Joe; can't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>this person</b></font>)</div>said this person. <div class="bookquote">` What's the good?'  (<font color='red'><b>this person</b></font>)</div>replied the man. `
<p/>This allusion to Nancy's doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) sex; and strongly advocated her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do what you like with me,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said the girl, turning to the men again; <div class="bookquote">`but do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for God Almighty's sake.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>The soft-hearted cook added his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) intercession, and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You don't suppose the young lady will see such as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); do you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>What's it to be?' said the man, with one foot on the stairs. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Nancy; <div class="bookquote">`and that if the lady will only hear the first word she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has to say, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will know whether to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) business, or to have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned out of doors as an impostor.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` I say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said the man, <div class="bookquote">`you're coming it strong!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You give the message,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the girl firmly; <div class="bookquote">`and let me hear the answer.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless, listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The man ran upstairs. It's no good being proper in this world,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the first housemaid. <div class="bookquote">` Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,'  (<font color='red'><b>the housemaid</b></font>)</div>said the second.
<p/>The third contented herself with wondering <div class="bookquote">`what ladies was made of' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of <div class="bookquote">`Shameful!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with which the Dianas concluded.
<p/>Regardless of all this: for she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) had weightier matters at heart: Nancy followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling.
<p/>The girl's life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the woman's original nature left in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had entered, and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt burdened with the sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own deep shame, and shrunk as though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could scarcely bear the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had sought this interview.
<p/>But struggling with these better feelings was pride,--the vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and self-assured.
<p/>The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the fallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself,--even this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought a weakness, but which alone connected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with that humanity, of which her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wasting life had obliterated so many, many traces when a very child.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending them on the ground, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head with affected carelessness as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">`It's a hard matter to get to see you, lady.
<p/>If I had taken offence, and gone away, as many would have done, you'd have been sorry for it one day, and not without reason either.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`

<p/>The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl completely by surprise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) burst into tears. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do not think of that. Tell me why you wished to see me. I am the person you inquired for.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Oh, lady, lady!'

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied the girl; <div class="bookquote">`and knew you were here, for it was by hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tell the place that I found you out.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I never heard the name,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said Rose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery, I--suspecting this man--listened to a conversation held between him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and Fagin in the dark.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) goes by some other amongst us,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl, <div class="bookquote">`which I more than thought before. I found out, from what I heard, that Monks--the man I asked you about, you know--'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Monks,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>pursued the girl, <div class="bookquote">`had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and had known him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) directly to be the same child that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was watching for, though I couldn't make out why.
<p/>A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) should have a certain sum; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was to have more for making him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) a thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of finding out,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl people</b></font>)</div>said the girl; <div class="bookquote">`and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery.
<p/>Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl people</b></font>)</div>said Rose, <div class="bookquote">`I understand.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`--That For what purpose?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>asked Rose. <div class="bookquote">` But I did; and I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) no more till last night.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Again they went upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me, again listened at the door.
<p/>And what occurred then?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I'll tell you, lady. Last night he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) came again. The first words I heard Monks say were these:
<p/>``So the only proofs of the boy's identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) coffin.
<p/>They laughed, and talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) success in doing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild, said that though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had got the young devil's money safely now, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d rather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father's will, by driving him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) through every jail in town, and then hauling him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up for some capital felony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) besides.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>'' What is all this!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose. <div class="bookquote">` The truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to yours, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could gratify his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hatred by taking the boy's life without bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own neck in danger, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) would; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) couldn't, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'d be upon the watch to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) at every turn in life; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) took advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) birth and history, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) might harm him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) yet.
<p/>In short, Fagin,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) says, ``Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as I'll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.
<p/>Those were his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) words,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had scarcely ceased to do, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) began to speak, for a vision of Sikes haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) perpetually. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) spoke of you and the other lady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), that Oliver should come into your hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) laughed, and said there was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who your two-legged spaniel was.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`

 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is an earnest man when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hatred is up.
<p/>I know many who do worse things; but I'd rather listen to them all a dozen times, than to that Monks once.
<p/>It is growing late, and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this.
<p/>I must get back quickly.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` But what can I do?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose. <div class="bookquote">` To what use can I turn this communication without you?

(<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I wish to go back,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I must go back, because--how can I tell such things to an innocent lady like you?--because among the men I have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all; that I can't leave: no, not even to be saved from the life I am leading now.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Your having interfered in this dear boy's behalf before,' said Rose; <div class="bookquote">`your coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard; your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed.
<p/>Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said the earnest girl, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands as the tears coursed down her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face, `do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex; the first--the first, I do believe, who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion.
<p/>Back! Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors? <div class="bookquote">` Do hear my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.'
 (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady,' cried the girl, sinking on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees, <div class="bookquote">`dear, sweet, angel lady, you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these, and if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>` <div class="bookquote">` It is never too late,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said Rose, <div class="bookquote">`for penitence and atonement.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` It is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, writhing in agony of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind; <div class="bookquote">`I cannot leave him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) now!
<p/>I could not be his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) death.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why should you be?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>asked Rose. <div class="bookquote">` Nothing could save him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>cried the girl. `
<p/>If I told others what I have told you, and led to their being taken, he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) would be sure to die.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Is it possible,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>cried Rose, <div class="bookquote">`that for such a man as this, you can resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue?
<p/>I don't know what it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>answered the girl; <div class="bookquote">`I only know that it is so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself.
<p/>Whether it is God's wrath for the wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) through every suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew that I was to die by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand at last.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is the boldest, and has been so cruel!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It is madness.' <div class="bookquote">` I must go back. What am I to do?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I should not let you depart from me thus.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You should, lady, and I know you will,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl, rising. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness, and forced no promise from you, as I might have done.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>This mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me, benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?' <div class="bookquote">`You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret, and advise you what to do,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose. <div class="bookquote">` But where can I find you again when it is necessary?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>asked Rose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I shall not be watched or followed?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Every Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl without hesitation, <div class="bookquote">`I will walk on London Bridge if I am alive.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>I promise you solemnly,' answered Rose. ` <div class="bookquote">` Stay another moment,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door. `
<p/>You have a claim on me: not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption.
<p/>Think once again on your own condition, and the opportunity you have of escaping from it. Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you?
<p/>What fascination is it that can take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery? Oh! is there no chord in your heart that I can touch!
<p/><div class="bookquote">`When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl steadily, <div class="bookquote">`give away your hearts, love will carry you all lengths--even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers, everything, to fill them.
<p/>When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us?
<p/>Pity us, lady--pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left, and for having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a comfort and a pride, into a new means of violence and suffering.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>You will,' said Rose, after a pause, <div class="bookquote">`take some money from me, which may enable you to live without dishonesty--at all events until we meet again?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>Is there nothing left, to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!' ` <div class="bookquote">`Not a penny,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said Rose, stepping gently forward. <div class="bookquote">` I wish to serve you indeed.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>You would serve me best, lady,' replied the girl, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, `if you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think of what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have lived.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` God bless you, sweet lady, and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought shame on mine!'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away; while Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank into a chair, and endeavoured to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wandering thoughts.
<p/>CHAPTER XLI CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, LIKE MISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty.
<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which Oliver's history was enveloped, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had just conversed, had reposed in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), as a young and guileless girl.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) words and manner had touched Rose Maylie's heart; and, mingled with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.
<p/>They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast.
<p/>It was now midnight of the first day. What course of action could she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) determine upon, which could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours?
<p/>Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman's impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first explosion of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) indignation, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would regard the instrument of Oliver's recapture, to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) with the secret, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) representations in the girl's behalf could be seconded by no experienced person.
<p/>These were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject.
<p/>As to resorting to any legal adviser, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the same reason.
<p/>Once the thought occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) of seeking assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting, and it seemed unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back, when--the tears rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) pursued this train of reflection--he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might have by this time learnt to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>), and to be happier away.
<p/>Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive consideration presented itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) mind; Rose passed a sleepless and anxious night.
<p/>Or how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) postpone the journey without exciting suspicion? After more communing with herself next day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If it be painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Maylie/HARRY MAYLIE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) thought, `to come back here, how painful it will be to me! But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will not come; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) may write, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me
<p/>And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) messenger should not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) weep.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) letter without writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) did when he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) went away. I hardly thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) would; but it was better for us both.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Giles/Giles</b></font>)</div>What makes you look so flurried?' asked Rose, advancing to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>To think that I should see him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) at last, and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, soothing him (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>replied the boy. <div class="bookquote">` Oh dear! But what is this?--of whom do you speak?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` I have seen the gentleman,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, scarcely able to articulate, <div class="bookquote">`the gentleman who was so good to me--Mr. Brownlow, that we have so often talked about.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>I didn't speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)--I couldn't speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) didn't see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Where?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>asked Rose. <div class="bookquote">` Getting out of a coach,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight, <div class="bookquote">`and going into a house. But Giles asked, for me, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) lived there, and they said he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) did.
<p/>Look here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, <div class="bookquote">`here it is; here's where he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lives--I'm going there directly! Oh, dear me, dear me!
<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was Craven Street, in the Strand.
<p/>What shall I do when I come to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) and hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) speak again!'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Quick!'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">` Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready to go with me. I will take you there directly, without a minute's loss of time.
<p/>I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and be ready as soon as you are.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to Craven Street.
<p/>When they arrived there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); and sending up her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) card by the servant, requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business.
<p/>The servant soon returned, to beg that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) would walk upstairs; and following him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat.
<p/>At no great distance from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chin propped thereupon. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Dear me,'  (<font color='red'><b>another gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising with great politeness, <div class="bookquote">`I beg your pardon, young lady --I imagined it was some importunate person who--I beg you will excuse me.
<p/>Be seated, pray.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>said Rose, glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I believe,'  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Maylie</b></font>)</div>interposed Miss Maylie, <div class="bookquote">`that at this period of our interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away.
<p/>That is my name,'  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Maylie</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` This is my friend, Mr. Grimwig. If I am correctly informed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak to you.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very stiff bow, and risen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) chair, made another very stiff bow, and dropped into it again. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>, I have no doubt,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Rose, naturally embarrassed; <div class="bookquote">`but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) again.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brownlow inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) head. I shall surprise you very much <div class="bookquote">` Indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">` Oliver Twist you knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) as,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Rose.
<p/>The words no sooner escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with a great crash, and falling back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) chair, discharged from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) former attitude, and looking out straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) emitted a long deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air, but to die away in the innermost recesses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) stomach.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) chair nearer to Miss Maylie's, and said, <div class="bookquote">`Do me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once induced to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven's name put me in possession of it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Maylie</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'll eat my head if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) is not a bad one,'  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Maylie</b></font>)</div>growled Mr. Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Rose, colouring; <div class="bookquote">`and that Power which has thought fit to try him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) years, has planted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) days six times over.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his (<font color='blue'><b>Browlow</b></font>) astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner. A bad one! <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I don't see the application of that remark.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Do not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) does not mean what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) says.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>I'm only sixty-one,' said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face. ` And, as the devil's in it <div class="bookquote">` Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) does,'  (<font color='red'><b>the devil</b></font>)</div>growled Mr. Grimwig. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) does not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)'ll eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) head, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) doesn't,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>growled Mr. Grimwig. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>)'d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>responded Mr. Grimwig, knocking his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) stick upon the floor.
<p/>Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) would deserve to have it knocked off, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) does,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">` Now, Miss Maylie,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested.
<p/>Will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child: allowing me to promise that I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), and that since I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) former associates to rob me, has been considerably shaken.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Rose, who had had time to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) thoughts, at once related, in a few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) left Mr. Brownlow's house; reserving Nancy's information for that gentleman's private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) only sorrow, for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) former benefactor and friend. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thank God!'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` This is great happiness to me, great happiness. But you have not told me where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is now, Miss Maylie.
<p/>You must pardon my finding fault with you,--but why not have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is waiting in a coach at the door,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose. `
<p/>With which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hurried out of the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach, without another word.
<p/>When the room-door closed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), Mr. Grimwig lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) head, and converting one of the hind legs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) chair into a pivot, described three distinct circles with the assistance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) stick and the table; sitting in it all the time.
<p/>After performing this evolution, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) rose and limped as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) could up and down the room at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) without the slightest preface. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>At this door!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>cried the old gentleman. Hush!' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding. `
<p/>In fact, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) threw himself at one dexterous dive into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) former seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) anxiety and care in Oliver's behalf, Rose Maylie would have been well repaid. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't be afraid. I'm old enough to be your grandfather. You're a sweet girl. I like you. Here they are!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose Maylie</b></font>)</div>There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,' said Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and dropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,'  (<font color='red'><b>The housekeeper</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, rather testily. <div class="bookquote">` Well, that I do, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied the old lady. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`I could have told you that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`but put on your glasses, and see if you can't find out what you were wanted for, will you?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>People's eyes, at my time of life, don't improve with age, sir.' The old lady began to rummage in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pocket for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spectacles.
<p/>But Oliver's patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) first impulse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sprang into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>God be good to me!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady, embracing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">`it is my innocent boy!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` My dear old nurse!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried Oliver. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would come back--I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">` How well he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) looks, and how like a gentleman's son he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is dressed again!
<p/>Where have you been, this long, long while? Ah! the same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad.
<p/>I have never forgotten them or his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) quiet smile, but have seen them every day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I was a lightsome young creature.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Running on thus, and now holding Oliver from her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to mark how he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had grown, now clasping him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) and passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) fingers fondly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) hair, the good soul laughed and wept upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) neck by turns.
<p/>Leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) interview with Nancy, which occasioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) no little surprise and perplexity.
<p/>The old gentleman considered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself.
<p/>To afford him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) an early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) should call at the hotel at eight o'clock that evening, and that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred.
<p/>Rose also explained her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) reasons for not confiding in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance. These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver returned home.
<p/>Nancy's history was no sooner unfolded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), than he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff; and actually put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Duff</b></font>) hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies.
<p/>And, doubtless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Duff</b></font>) would, in this first outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment's consideration of the consequences, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Duff</b></font>) had not been restrained, in part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was himself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hotbrained purpose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor's wrath. Then what the devil is to be done?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the impetuous doctor, when they had rejoined the two ladies. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?'  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not exactly that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; <div class="bookquote">`but we must proceed gently and with great care.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Gentleness and care,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the doctor. <div class="bookquote">` I'd send them one and all to--'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Never mind where,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>interposed Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What object?'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>asked the doctor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Simply, the discovery of Oliver's parentage, and regaining for him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) the inheritance of which, if this story be true, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) has been fraudulently deprived.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>You see,' pursued Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`placing this poor girl entirely out of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) safety, what good should we bring about?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>`
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief; <div class="bookquote">`I almost forgot that.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Hanging a few of them at least, in all probability,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>suggested the doctor, <div class="bookquote">`and transporting the rest.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Very good,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; <div class="bookquote">`but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest--or at least to Oliver's, which is the same thing.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man, Monks, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` How?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>inquired the doctor. <div class="bookquote">` Thus. That can only be done by stratagem, and by catching him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is not surrounded by these people.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is not even -LRB-so far as we know, or as the facts appear to us-RRB- concerned with the gang in any of their robberies.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) were not discharged, it is very unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mouth would be so obstinately closed that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) might as well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor impetuously, <div class="bookquote">`I put it to you again, whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions, but really--'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) was about to speak. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>For, suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) were apprehended, we have no proof against him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>). The promise shall be kept. I don't think it will, in the slightest degree, interfere with our proceedings.
<p/>But, before we can resolve upon any precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will point out this Monks, on the understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law; or, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) such an account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) haunts and description of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) person, as will enable us to identify him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is Tuesday. I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman's proposition was carried unanimously. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material assistance to us; I should say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was bred a lawyer, and quitted the Bar in disgust because he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had only one brief and a motion of course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not, you must determine for yourselves.'  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I should like,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig. I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in mine,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That lady's son, and this young lady's--very old friend,'  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an expressive glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) niece.
<p/>Rose blushed deeply, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) did not make any audible objection to this motion -LRB-possibly she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) felt in a hopeless minority-RRB-; and Harry Maylie and Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We stay in town, of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Grimwig/Grimwig/MR. GRIMWIG</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Maylie, <div class="bookquote">`while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success.
<p/>I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to remain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that any hope remains.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div><p/>We must put it to the vote,' replied Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`who may he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) be?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">` Good!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And as I see on the faces about me, a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to corroborate Oliver's tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story.
<p/>Believe me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough.
<p/>Supper has been announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) company, and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) forth upon the world.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Come! With these words, the old gentleman gave his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand to Mrs. Maylie, and escorted her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) into the supper-room. Mr. Losberne followed, leading Rose; and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up.
<p/>Upon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London, by the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention.
<p/>They were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female: for the former was one of those long-limbed, knock-kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age,--looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like undergrown men, and when they are almost men, like overgrown boys.
<p/>The woman was young, but of a robust and hardy make, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely dangled from a stick which he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) carried over his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) shoulder, a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough.
<p/>This circumstance, added to the length of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) legs, which were of unusual extent, enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) with much ease to keep some half-dozen paces in advance of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) companion, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head: as if reproaching her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tardiness, and urging her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to greater exertion.
<p/>Thus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until they passed through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) companion, <div class="bookquote">`Come on, can't yer?
<p/>CHAPTER XLII AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER'S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS, BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's a heavy load, I can tell you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the female</b></font>)</div>said the female, coming up, almost breathless with fatigue. <div class="bookquote">` Heavy! What are yer talking about?
<p/>What are yer made for?'  (<font color='red'><b>the female</b></font>)</div>rejoined the male traveller, changing his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) own little bundle as he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) spoke, to the other shoulder. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, there yer are, resting again! Well, if yer ain't enough to tire anybody's patience out, I don't know what is!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Is it much farther?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>asked the woman, resting herself against a bank, and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">` Much farther!
<p/>Yer as good as there,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the long-legged tramper, pointing out before him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Look there! Those are the lights of London.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Never mind whether they're two mile off, or twenty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah Claypole; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) it was; `but get up and come on, or I'll kick yer,
<p/>As Noah's red nose grew redder with anger, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) crossed the road while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) threat into execution, the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) side. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They're a good two mile off, at least,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman despondingly. <div class="bookquote">` and so I give yer notice.'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Where do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?'
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked, after they had walked a few hundred yards. ` How should I know? ` replied Noah, whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Near, I hope,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">` No, not near,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Claypole. <div class="bookquote">` There! Not near; so don't think it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why not?'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` When I tell yer that I don't mean to do a thing, that's enough, without any why or because either,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Claypole with dignity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A pretty thing it would be, wouldn't it to go and stop at the very first public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) come up after us, might poke in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerberry</b></font>) old nose, and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone.
<p/>I shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop till we come to the very out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I've got a head; for if we hadn't gone, at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer'd have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady.
<p/>Well, you needn't be so cross,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) companion. ` <div class="bookquote">` No! Cod, yer may thanks yer stars And serve yer right for being a fool.'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I know I ain't as cunning as you are,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>replied Charlotte; <div class="bookquote">`but don't put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up.
<p/>You would have been if I had been, any way.'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Claypole. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you are,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said the lady, chucking him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) under the chin, and drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>).
<p/>This was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole's habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be observed, in justice to that gentleman, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had trusted Charlotte to this extent, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be found on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>): which would leave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) an opportunity of asserting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) innocence of any theft, and would greatly facilitate his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chances of escape.
<p/>I took it for you, Noah, dear,' rejoined Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">` Did I keep it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Claypole. ` Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) entered at this juncture, into no explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) motives, and they walked on very lovingly together.
<p/>In pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without halting, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) wisely judged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that London began in earnest.
<p/>Just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets, and consequently the most to be avoided, he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) crossed into Saint John's Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between Gray's Inn Lane and Smithfield, render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of London.
<p/>Through these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>); now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public-house; now jogging on again, as some fancied appearance induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) to believe it too public for his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) purpose.
<p/>At length, he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) stopped in front of one, more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) had yet seen; and, having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement, graciously announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) intention of putting up there, for the night. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So give us the bundle,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Noah, unstrapping it from the woman's shoulders, and slinging it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) own; <div class="bookquote">`and don't yer speak, except when yer spoke to.
<p/>What's the name of the house--t -h-r-- three what?'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Cripples,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">` Three Cripples,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>repeated Noah, <div class="bookquote">`and a very good sign too.
<p/>Now, then! Keep close at my heels, and come along.'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>With these injunctions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) pushed the rattling door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) shoulder, and entered the house, followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) companion.
<p/>There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) two elbows on the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper.
<p/>If Noah had been attired in his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) charity-boy's dress, there might have been some reason for the Jew opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eyes so wide; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) leathers, there seemed no particular reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) appearance exciting so much attention in a public-house. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) stared very hard at Noah, and Noah stared very hard at him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>). Is this the Three Cripples?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked Noah. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country, recommended us here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and perhaps to warn her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to betray no surprise. `
<p/>That is the dabe of this <div class="bookquote">`ouse,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew. <div class="bookquote">` We want to sleep here to-night.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I' (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>b dot certaid you cad,' said Barney, who was the attendant sprite; `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Show us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring, will yer?'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>said Noah.
<p/>Barney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting the required viands before them; having done which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable couple to their refreshment.
<p/>Now, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps lower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last-named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only look down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of being observed -LRB-the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself-RRB-, but could, by applying his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable distinctness, their subject of conversation.
<p/>The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) eye from this place of espial for five minutes, and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related, when Fagin, in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) evening's business, came into the bar to inquire after some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) young pupils. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>but I'll idquire.'  (<font color='red'><b>pupils</b></font>)</div>Hush!' said Barney: `stradegers id the next roob. ` <div class="bookquote">`Strangers!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>repeated the old man in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ah! Ad rub uds too,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>added Barney. <div class="bookquote">` Frob the cuttry, but subthig in your way, or I' (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>b bistaked.' Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.
<p/>Mounting a stool, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) cautiously applied his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eye to the pane of glass, from which secret post he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from the dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses of both to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) pleasure. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Aha!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) whispered, looking round to Barney, `I like that fellow's looks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>)'d be of use to us; he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) knows how to train the girl already.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) again applied his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) eye to the glass, and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) ear to the partition, listened attentively: with a subtle and eager look upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) face, that might have appertained to some old goblin. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So I mean to be a gentleman,'  (<font color='red'><b>some goblin</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) legs, and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had arrived too late to hear. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear 'em talk --let me hear 'em.'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>No more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a gentleman's life for me: and, if yer
<p/>like, yer shall be a lady.' <div class="bookquote">` I should like that well enough, dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>replied Charlotte; <div class="bookquote">`but tills ain't to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Tills be blowed!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Claypole; <div class="bookquote">`there's more things besides tills to be emptied.'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What do you mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Pockets, women's ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Claypole, rising with the porter. <div class="bookquote">` But you can't do all that, dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the porter</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` I shall look out to get into company with them as can,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>replied Noah. <div class="bookquote">` They'll be able to make us useful some way or another.
<p/>Why, you yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Lor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Charlotte, imprinting a kiss upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) ugly face. <div class="bookquote">` There, that'll do: don't yer be too affectionate, in case
<p/>I should like to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of 'em, and follering 'em about, unbeknown to themselves.
<p/>That would suit me, if there was good profit; and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound note you've got,--especially as we don't very well know how to get rid of it ourselves.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>After expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents, nodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) appeared greatly refreshed.
<p/>I'm cross with yer,' said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity. ` He (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) was meditating another, when the sudden opening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).
<p/>And very amiable he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) looked, and a very low bow he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) made, as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest table, ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The stranger was Mr. Fagin. A pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,'  (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We have not so much dust as that in London,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, pointing from Noah's shoes to those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) companion, and from them to the two bundles. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>From the country, I see, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`How do yer see that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked Noah Claypole. <div class="bookquote">` Yer a sharp feller,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew, sinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) voice to a confidential whisper; <div class="bookquote">`and that's the truth.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) right forefinger,--a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though not with complete success, in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) own nose not being large enough for the purpose.
<p/>However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) opinion, and put about the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly manner. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket, or a woman's reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drinks it regularly.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Barney</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) own remarks than he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) fell back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ha! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!'  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>Good stuff that,' observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">` Dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Fagin. <div class="bookquote">` Don't mind me, my dear
<p/>,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) chair closer. <div class="bookquote">` Ha! ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance.
<p/>I didn't take it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) legs like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) could under his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) chair; <div class="bookquote">`it was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) doing; yer've got it now, Charlotte, yer know yer have.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No matter who's got it, or who did it, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk's eye at the girl and the two bundles. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It was very lucky it was only me.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I'm in that way myself, and I like you for it.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>In what way?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering. <div class="bookquote">` In that way of business,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>rejoined Fagin; <div class="bookquote">`and so are the people of the house.
<p/>There is not a safer place in all this town than is the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it
<p/>And I have taken a fancy to you and the young woman; so I've said the word, and you may make your minds easy.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Noah Claypole's mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) body certainly was not; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) shuffled and writhed about, into various uncouth positions: eyeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'll tell you more,'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had reassured the girl, by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have got a friend that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You've hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe here as you could be. so. Yer speak as if yer were in earnest,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah. `
<p/>What advantage would it be to me to be anything else? ` inquired Fagin, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">` Here! Let me have a word with you outside.'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There's no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Noah, getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) legs by gradual degrees abroad again. ` She (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>)'ll take the luggage upstairs the while.
<p/>This mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed without the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) way off with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) out. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Charlotte, see to them bundles.'

<p/>Quite perfect,'  (<font color='red'><b>a keeper</b></font>)</div>rejoined Fagin, clapping him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) on the shoulder. <div class="bookquote">` You're a genius, my dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why, I suppose if I wasn't, I shouldn't be here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Noah. <div class="bookquote">`

(<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Now, what do you think?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR.

<p/>Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) in a good way of business; that's where it is!'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>responded Noah, winking one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) little eyes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best society in the profession.'

<p/>Not a countryman among 'em; and I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>)'d take you, even on my recommendation, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) didn't run rather short of assistants just now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Should I have to hand over?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR.

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`When could I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>asked Noah doubtfully. <div class="bookquote">` To-morrow morning.'

<p/>Whether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) recollected that, in the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) refusal, it was in the power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) new acquaintance to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) up to justice immediately -LRB-and more unlikely things had come to pass-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) gradually relented, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) thought that would suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But, yer see,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>observed Noah, <div class="bookquote">`as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) will be able to do a good deal, I should like to take something very light.'

<p/>In fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) young friend's eccentric disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) abilities. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What a regular game! --ha! ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>We must know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,' said Fagin. <div class="bookquote">`

(<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>asked Charley. <div class="bookquote">` Not for the world,'  (<font color='red'><b>Charley/Bates/Charley Bates</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin. <div class="bookquote">` Are you mad, my dear, stark mad, that you'd walk into the very place where--No, Charley, no.

(<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>asked Master Bates, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) hand on Noah's arm. <div class="bookquote">`

<p/>Oh, I dare say about that, yer know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>observed Noah, backing towards the door, and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) head with a kind of sober alarm. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Really nothing, my dear ,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, <div class="bookquote">`really nothing.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, no--none of that. It's not in my department, that ain't.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div><p/>The cutting away when there's anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there's everything right; is that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) branch?' <div class="bookquote">`Never mind,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bolter/Morris Bolter/Mr. Morris Bolter</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Bolter; `and don't yer take liberties with yer superiors, little boy, or yer'll
<p/>` Wot department has he (<font color='blue'><b>Bolter</b></font>) got, Fagin? ` inquired Master Bates, surveying Noah's lank form with much disgust. <div class="bookquote">` find yerself in the wrong shop.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it was some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office; that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had engaged, nor any description of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) person, had yet been forwarded to the metropolis, it was very probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) were properly disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) to visit as any in London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could be supposed likely to resort of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own free will.
<p/>Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much greater degree by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented, with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition.
<p/>By Fagin's directions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) immediately substituted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own attire, a waggoner's frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings: all of which articles the Jew had at hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter's whip. Thus equipped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was to saunter into the office,
<p/>as some country fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) curiousity; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) would look the part to perfection.
<p/>These arrangements completed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of Bow Street.
<p/>Having described the precise situation of the office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was to walk straight up the passage, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) got into the side, and pull off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) hat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) went into the room, Charley Bates bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) hurry on alone, and promised to bide his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) return on the spot of their parting.
<p/>Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually followed the directions he (<font color='blue'><b>Bolter</b></font>) had received, which--Master Bates being pretty well acquainted with the locality--were so exact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question, or meeting with any interruption by the way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in the middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful locality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine -LRB-if they could-RRB- the full majesty of justice.
<p/>There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table.
<p/>A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) nose listlessly with a large key, except when he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked sternly up to bid some woman <div class="bookquote">`Take that baby out,'  (<font color='red'><b>some woman</b></font>)</div>when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the mother's shawl, from some meagre infant.
<p/>There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock above the dock--the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it.
<p/>Noah looked eagerly about him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) for the Dodger; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character's mother or sister, and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, nobody at all answering the description given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women, being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) felt at once could be no other than the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) visit.
<p/>It was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) left hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) pocket, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait altogether indescribable, and, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) place in the dock, requested in an audible voice to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawkins</b></font>) was placed in that `ere disgraceful sitivation for. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The room smelt close and unwholesome; the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling blackened. Hold your tongue, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the jailer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'm an Englishman, ain't I?'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>rejoined the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">` Where are my priwileges?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You'll get your privileges soon enough,'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer pepper</b></font>)</div>retorted the jailer, <div class="bookquote">`and pepper with 'em.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the jailer pepper</b></font>)</div><p/>We'll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to say to the beaks, if I don't,' replied Mr. Dawkins. `
<p/>I shall thank the madg`strates to dispose of this here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for I've got an appointment with a genelman in the City, and as I am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll go away if I ain't there to my time, and then pr`aps ther won't be an action for damage against them as kep me away.
<p/>At this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to communicate <div class="bookquote">`the names of them two files as was on the bench.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div><p/>Which so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as Master Bates could have done if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had heard the request. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Now then! Wot is this here business? Oh no, certainly not!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Silence there!' cried the jailer. ` What is this?
<p/>` inquired one of the magistrates. <div class="bookquote">` A pick-pocketing case, your worship.'  (<font color='red'><b>the magistrates</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Has the boy ever been here before?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ought to have been, a many times,'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>replied the jailer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) has been pretty well everywhere else. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) well, your worship.'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh! you know me, do you?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the Artful, making a note of the statement. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Wery good. That's a case of deformation of character, any way.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now then, where are the witnesses?'  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the clerk. <div class="bookquote">` Ah! that's right,'  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>added the Dodger. <div class="bookquote">` Where are they? I should like to see 'em.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div><p/>This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very old one, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) deliberately put back again, after trying it on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own countenance.
<p/>For this reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) took the Dodger into custody as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) could get near him (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>), and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) person a silver snuff-box, with the owner's name engraved upon the lid.
<p/>This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had missed it on the previous day, the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in making his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the magistrate. <div class="bookquote">` I wouldn't abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the magistrate</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Do you hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) worship ask if you've anything to say?'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>inquired the jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) elbow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Have you anything to say at all?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div>I beg your pardon,' said the Dodger, looking up with an air of abstraction. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Did you redress yourself to me, my man?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dodger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>observed the officer with a grin. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger, `not here, for this ain't the shop for justice: besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning with the Wice President of the House of Commons; but I shall have something to say elsewhere, and so will he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>), and so will a wery numerous and <div class="bookquote">`spectable circle of acquaintance as'll make them beaks wish they'd never been born, or that they'd got their footmen to hang 'em up to their own hat-pegs, afore they let 'em come out this morning to try it on upon me.
<p/>Do you mean to say anything, you young shaver?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I'll--'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` There! He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)'s fully committed!'  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>interposed the clerk. <div class="bookquote">` Take him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) away.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Come on,'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>said the jailer. <div class="bookquote">` Oh ah! I'll come on,'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>replied the Dodger, brushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hat with the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ah! -LRB-to the Bench-RRB- it's no use your looking frightened; I won't show you no mercy, not a ha`porth of it.
<p/>You'll pay for this, my fine fellers. I wouldn't be you for something! I wouldn't go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me.
<p/>With these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar; threatening, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) got into the yard, to make a parliamentary business of it; and then grinning in the officer's face, with great glee and self-approval.
<p/>Having seen him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) way back to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) had left Master Bates.
<p/>After waiting here some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) was joined by that young gentleman, who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person.
<p/>The two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news that the Dodger was doing full justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodger</b></font>) bringing-up, and establishing for himself a glorious reputation.
<p/>Here, carry me off to prison! Take me away!'  (<font color='red'><b>Dodger</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XLIV THE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE.
<p/>Adept as she (<font color='blue'><b>NANCY</b></font>) was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had taken, wrought upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) mind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) remembered that both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) schemes, which had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion.
<p/>Vile as those schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) feelings towards Fagin, who had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), step by step, deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery,
<p/>whence was no escape; still, there were times when, even towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) felt some relenting, lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) disclosure should bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) within the iron grasp he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had so long eluded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) should fall at last--richly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) merited such a fate--by her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) hand.
<p/>But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) fears for Sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had stipulated that her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) secret should be rigidly kept, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had dropped no clue which could lead to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) discovery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had refused, even for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) sake, a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)--and what more could she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) do!
<p/>Though all her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they forced themselves upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), again and again, and left their traces too.
<p/>At times, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) took no heed of what was passing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), or no part in conversations where once, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) would have been the loudest.
<p/>At other times, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) laughed without merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards--she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) sat silent and dejected, brooding with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) hands, while the very effort by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these indications, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was ill at ease, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) companions.
<p/>SHE FAILS. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was resolved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) grew pale and thin, even within a few days. It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour.
<p/>Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen. The girl looked up from the low seat on which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) crouched, and listened too.
<p/>Eleven. <div class="bookquote">` An hour this side of midnight,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, raising the blind to look out and returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) seat. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Dark and heavy it is too. A good night for business this.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin. <div class="bookquote">` What a pity, Bill, my dear, that there's none quite ready to be done.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` You're right for once,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes gruffly. <div class="bookquote">` It is a pity, for I'm in the humour too.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>Fagin sighed, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) head despondingly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We must make up for lost time when we've got things into a good train. That's all I know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That's the way to talk, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin, venturing to pat him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) on the shoulder. <div class="bookquote">` It does me good to hear you.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Does you good, does it!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Well, so be it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Ha! ha! ha!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>laughed Fagin, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) were relieved by even this concession. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder, so take it away,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, casting off the Jew's hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You're like yourself to-night, Bill. Quite like yourself.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` It make you nervous, Bill,--reminds you of being nabbed, does it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, determined not to be offended. `
<p/>There never was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father, and I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is singeing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grizzled red beard by this time, unless you came straight from the old <div class="bookquote">`un without any father at all betwixt you; which I shouldn't wonder at, a bit.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin offered no reply to this compliment: but, pulling Sikes by the sleeve, pointed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) bonnet, and was now leaving the room. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>returned Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Hallo!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Nance. Where's the gal going to at this time of night?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Not far.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`What answer's that? ` retorted Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Do you hear me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I don't know where,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then I do,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had any real objection to the girl going where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) listed. <div class="bookquote">`

(<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment. <div class="bookquote">` That's it, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>replied the Jew in a whisper. `
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) eyes were swollen and red; she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) rocked herself to and fro; tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing. <div class="bookquote">`

Why, now she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s on the other tack!' exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of excessive surprise on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) companion.
<p/>Fagin nodded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) to take no further notice just then; and, in a few minutes, the girl subsided into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) accustomed demeanour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) paused when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) reached the room-door, and looking round, asked if somebody would light him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) down the dark stairs. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Whispering Sikes that there was no fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) relapsing, Fagin took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hat and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) good-night.

<p/>When they reached the passage, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lip, and drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">`

(<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, in the same tone. <div class="bookquote">` The reason of all this,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin. `

<p/>Well?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) mouth almost touching her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ear, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyes looking into hers. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No matter just now. We'll talk of this again. You have a friend in me, Nance; a staunch friend. I have the means at hand, quiet and close.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hand on hers, but said good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) parting look with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.
<p/>I know you well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, without manifesting the least emotion. <div class="bookquote">` Good-night.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>Fagin walked towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) home, intent upon the thoughts that were working within his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) brain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had conceived the idea--not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), but slowly and by degrees--that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker's brutality, had conceived an attachment for some new friend.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) altered manner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) repeated absences from home alone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) had once been so zealous, and, added to these, her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at least, almost matter of certainty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as Nancy, and must -LRB-thus Fagin argued-RRB- be secured without delay.
<p/>The object of this new liking was not among his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) myrmidons. There was another, and a darker object, to be gained.
<p/>The girl must know, well, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) off, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could never be safe from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) fury, and that it would be surely wreaked--to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life--on the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more recent fancy. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Sikes knew too much, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the wounds were hidden. With a little persuasion,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought Fagin, <div class="bookquote">`what more likely than that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would consent to poison him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)?
<p/>There would be the dangerous villain: the man I hate: gone; another secured in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime to back it, unlimited.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) sat alone, in the housebreaker's room; and with them uppermost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), of sounding the girl in the broken hints he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) threw out at parting.
<p/>Women have done such things, and worse, to secure the same object before now. There was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) meaning.
<p/>But perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and that was one of the chief ends to be attained. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The girl clearly comprehended it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) glance at parting showed that . How,'  (<font color='red'><b>the chief</b></font>)</div>thought Fagin, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) crept homeward, `can I increase my influence with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?
<p/>If, without extracting a confession from herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) laid a watch, discovered the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes -LRB-of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood in no common fear-RRB- unless she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) designs, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) not secure her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) compliance? <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What new power can I acquire?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Such brains are fertile in expedients. I can,' said Fagin, almost aloud. ` She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) durst not refuse me then.
<p/>Not for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life, not for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life! I have it all. The means are ready, and shall be set to work.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had left the bolder villain; and went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) way: busying his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) bony hands in the folds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) tattered garment, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) wrenched tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) grasp, as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) fingers.
<p/>The old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for the appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) new associate, who after a delay that seemed interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast. <div class="bookquote">`

<p/>You keep ready, and leave the rest to me.'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>On the seventh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) returned earlier, and with an exultation he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could not conceal.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) goes abroad to-night,' said Fagin, `and on the right errand, I'm sure; for she (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) has been alone all day, and the man she (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak.
<p/>Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>).
<p/>They left the house stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at length before a public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) had slept, on the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) arrival in London.
<p/>It was Sunday. <div class="bookquote">` Come with me. Quick!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was past eleven o'clock, and the door was closed. It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle.
<p/>Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words, Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of glass to Noah, and signed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They entered, without noise; and the door was closed behind them. Is that the woman?'  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) asked, scarcely above his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) breath.
<p/>Fagin nodded yes. <div class="bookquote">` I can't see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>whispered Noah. ` She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is looking down, and the candle is behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). `
<p/>In an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking to the girl, caused her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stay there,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>whispered Fagin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) signed to Barney, who withdrew. I see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now,' cried the spy. <div class="bookquote">` Plainly?'  (<font color='red'><b>the spy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I should know her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) among a thousand.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Fagin drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) behind a small partition which was curtained off, and they held their breaths as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) passed within a few feet of their place of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came out. Hist!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried the lad who held the door. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Dow.'  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>Noah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out. <div class="bookquote">` To the left,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>whispered the lad; <div class="bookquote">`take the left had, and keep od the other side.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl's retreating figure, already at some distance before him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) advanced as near as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the better to observe her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) motions.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked nervously round, twice or thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), pass on.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to gather courage as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) advanced, and to walk with a steadier and firmer step. The spy preserved the same relative distance between them, and followed: with his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) eye upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>One, which advanced with a swift and rapid step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as though in quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who slunk along in the deepest shadow he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could find, and, at some distance, accommodated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pace to hers: stopping when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stopped: and as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) moved again, creeping stealthily on: but never allowing himself, in the ardour of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursuit, to gain upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) footsteps.
<p/>Thus, they crossed the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman, apparently disappointed in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers, turned back.
<p/>The movement was sudden; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who watched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), was not thrown off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guard by it; for, shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) figure, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suffered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to pass on the opposite pavement.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was about the same distance in advance as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been before, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slipped quietly down, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again.
<p/>CHAPTER XLVI THE APPOINTMENT KEPT The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures emerged on London Bridge. At nearly the centre of the bridge, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stopped.
<p/>The man stopped too. It was a very dark night. The day had been unfavourable, and at that hour and place there were few people stirring.
<p/>Such as there were, hurried quickly past: very possibly without seeing, but certainly without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in view.
<p/>Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of London's destitute population, as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence: neither speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed.
<p/>A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks.
<p/>The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes.
<p/>The tower of old Saint Saviour's Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight.
<p/>The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro--closely watched meanwhile by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hidden observer--when the heavy bell of St. Paul's tolled for the death of another day.
<p/>The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse: the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child: midnight was upon them all.
<p/>The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by a grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a short distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked straight towards it.
<p/>Midnight had come upon the crowded city. They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when the girl started, and immediately made towards them.
<p/>They walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate.
<p/>They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close up--brushed against them, indeed--at that precise moment. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Not here,'  (<font color='red'><b>a countryman</b></font>)</div>said Nancy hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">`I am afraid to speak to you here. Come away--out of the public road--down the steps yonder!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) uttered these words, and indicated, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) hand, the direction in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.
<p/>The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the Surrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour's Church, form a landing-stairs from the river.
<p/>To this spot, the man bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after a moment's survey of the place, he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) began to descend.
<p/>Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames.
<p/>At this point the lower steps widen: so that a person turning that angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>), if only a step.
<p/>The countryman looked hastily round, when he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) reached this point; and as there seemed no better place of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty of room, he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) slipped aside, with his (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) back to the pilaster, and there waited: pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) could not hear what was said, he (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) could follow them again, with safety.
<p/>So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) had been led to expect, that he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) more than once gave the matter up for lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) was on the point of emerging from his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) hiding-place, and regaining the road above, when he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) heard the sound of footsteps, and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) ear.
<p/>These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights. He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely breathing, listened attentively. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This is far enough,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said a voice, which was evidently that of the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` I will not suffer the young lady to go any farther.
<p/>Many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but you see I am willing to humour you.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`To humour me!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the voice of the girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had followed. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, for what,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman in a kinder tone, <div class="bookquote">`for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place?
<p/>Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You're considerate, indeed, sir. To humour me! Well, well, it's no matter.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told you before,' replied Nancy, <div class="bookquote">`that I was afraid to speak to you there.
<p/>I don't know why it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>said the girl, shuddering, <div class="bookquote">`but I have such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` A fear of what?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` I scarcely know of what,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Horrible thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day.
<p/>I was reading a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things came into the print.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Imagination,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, soothing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'll swear I saw ``coffin'' written in every page of the book in large black letters,--aye, and they carried one close to me, in the streets to-night.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I wish I did. No imagination,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl in a hoarse voice. <div class="bookquote">` There is nothing unusual in that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. `
<p/>There was something so uncommon in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) manner, that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) heard the girl utter these words, and the blood chilled within him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to be calm, and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They have passed me often.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Real ones ,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl. <div class="bookquote">` This was not.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>Speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kindly,' said the young lady to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>cried the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, dear lady, why ar'n't those who claim to be God's own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth, and beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud instead of so much humbler?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A Turk turns his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) face, after washing it well, to the East, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) says his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) prayers; these good people, after giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles off, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven.
<p/>Poor creature! She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seems to need it.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover herself.
<p/>The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` You were not here last Sunday night,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">` I couldn't come,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy; `
<p/>` <div class="bookquote">`You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div>asked the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I was kept by force.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` By whom?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that I told the young lady of before. No,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's not very easy for me to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) unless he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows why; I couldn't give him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a drink of laudanum before I came away.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Did he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) awake before you returned?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>inquired the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` No; and neither he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nor any of them suspect me.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Good,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` Now listen to me.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I am ready,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) paused for a moment. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This young lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the gentleman began, <div class="bookquote">`has communicated to me, and to some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nearly a fortnight since.
<p/>I confess to you that I had doubts, at first, whether you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe you are.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>To prove to you that I am disposed to trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the secret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks.
<p/>But if--if--'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cannot be secured, or, if secured, cannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the girl earnestly. <div class="bookquote">` I repeat that I firmly believe it. Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, recoiling. <div class="bookquote">` That man must be delivered up by you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I will not do it! I will never do it!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied the girl. <div class="bookquote">` Devil that he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) is, and worse than devil as he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) has been to me, I will never do that.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You will not?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this answer. <div class="bookquote">` Never!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>returned the girl. <div class="bookquote">` Tell me why?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>For one reason,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl firmly, <div class="bookquote">`for one reason, that the lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will, for I have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) promise: and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the same courses together, and I'll not turn upon them, who might--any of them--have turned upon me, but didn't, bad as they are.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been aiming to attain; <div class="bookquote">`put Monks into my hands, and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to me to deal with.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turns against the others?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver's little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye, and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And if it is not?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>suggested the girl. <div class="bookquote">` Then,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>pursued the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`this Fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent.
<p/>In such a case I could show you reasons, I think, which would induce you to yield it.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Have I the lady's promise for that?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>asked the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You have,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied Rose. <div class="bookquote">` My true and faithful pledge.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, after a short pause. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Never,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` The intelligence should be brought to bear upon him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could never even guess.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl after another interval of silence, <div class="bookquote">`but I will take your words.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>After receiving an assurance from both, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might safely do so, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, to describe, by name and situation, the public-house whence
<p/>From the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) occasionally paused, it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) communicated.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had thoroughly explained the localities of the place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit of frequenting it, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to consider for a few moments, for the purpose of recalling his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) features and appearances more forcibly to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) recollection. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is tall,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the girl, <div class="bookquote">`and a strongly made man, but not stout; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a lurking walk; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walks, constantly looks over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other.
<p/>Don't forget that, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes are sunk in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head so much deeper than any other man's, that you might almost tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by that alone.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face is dark, like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair and eyes; and, although he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't be more than six or eight and twenty, withered and haggard.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has desperate fits, and sometimes even bites his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and covers them with wounds--why did you start?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl man stout</b></font>)</div>said the girl, stopping suddenly.
<p/>The gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was not conscious of having done so, and begged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to proceed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Part of this,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said the girl, <div class="bookquote">`I have drawn out from other people at the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) twice, and both times he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was covered up in a large cloak.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been followed that night. I think that's all I can give you to know him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) by. Stay though,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Upon his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) throat: so high that you can see a part of it below his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) neckerchief when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turns his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face: there is--'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`A broad red mark, like a burn or scald?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>cried the gentleman. `
<p/>The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>How's this?'  (<font color='red'><b>the listener</b></font>)</div>said the girl. <div class="bookquote">` You know him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>I think I do,' said the gentleman, breaking silence. ` I should by your description.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mutter, <div class="bookquote">`It must be he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)!'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Now,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, returning: so it seemed by the sound: to the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had stood before, <div class="bookquote">`you have given us most valuable assistance, young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it.
<p/>We shall see. Many people are singularly like each other. It may not be the same.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>What can I do to serve you?' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You will not persist in saying that,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>rejoined the gentleman, with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied Nancy. <div class="bookquote">` Think now. Tell me.'  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy/Miss Nancy/NANCY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Nothing, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl, weeping. <div class="bookquote">` You can do nothing to help me.
<p/>The past has been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows
<p/>I am past all hope, indeed.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You put yourself beyond its pale,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` but once and never grants again, but, for the future, you may hope.
<p/>I do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you.
<p/>Before the dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of day-light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment.
<p/>I would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion, or take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you.
<p/>Come! Quit them all, while there is time and opportunity!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will be persuaded now,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the young lady. <div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hesitates, I am sure.'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I fear not, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">` No sir, I do not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, after a short struggle. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am chained to my old life. I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave it. I must have gone too far to turn
<p/>back,--and yet I don't know, for if you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it off.
<p/>But,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, looking hastily round, <div class="bookquote">`this fear comes over me again. I must go home.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Home!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Home, lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl. <div class="bookquote">` To such a home as I have raised for myself with the work of my whole life.
<p/>If I have done you any service all I ask is, that you leave me, and let me go my way alone.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Let us part. I shall be watched or seen. Go! Go! <div class="bookquote">` It is useless,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We compromise her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) safety, perhaps, by staying here.

(<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>urged the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You have.'

(<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>repeated the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them.
<p/>Look before you, lady. Look at that dark water. It may be years hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at last.'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do not speak thus, pray,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>returned the young lady, sobbing. <div class="bookquote">` It will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors should!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replied the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Good-night, good-night!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>The gentleman turned away. <div class="bookquote">` This purse,'  (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div>cried the young lady. <div class="bookquote">` Take it for my sake, that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl. <div class="bookquote">` I have not done this for money. Let me have that to think of. And yet--give me something that you have worn: I should like to have something--no, no, not a ring--
<p/>your gloves or handkerchief--anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you, sweet lady. There. Bless you! God bless you.
<p/>The violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to ill-usage and violence, seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) requested.
<p/>Good-night, good-night!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased. The two figures of the young lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge.
<p/>They stopped at the summit of the stairs. <div class="bookquote">` Hark!'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the young lady, listening. <div class="bookquote">` Did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) call! I thought I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice.'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No, my love,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. <div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has not moved, and will not till we are gone.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>As they disappeared, the girl sunk down nearly at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) full length upon one of the stone stairs, and vented the anguish of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart in bitter tears.
<p/>Rose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and led her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), with gentle force, away. After a time she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street.
<p/>The astonished listener remained motionless on his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) post for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious glances round him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) was again alone, crept slowly from his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) hiding-place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in the same manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) had descended.
<p/>Peeping out, more than once, when he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) reached the top, to make sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) utmost speed, and made for the Jew's house as fast as his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) legs would carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>).
<p/>It was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) old lair, with face so distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) looked less like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and worried by an evil spirit.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) side.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) right hand was raised to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) lips, and as, absorbed in thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hit his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) long black nails, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) disclosed among his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog's or rat's.
<p/>Towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) the old man sometimes directed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes for an instant, and then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table, plainly showed that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts were busy elsewhere.
<p/>CHAPTER XLVII FATAL CONSEQUENCES Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep. Indeed they were. Mortification at the overthrow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) notable scheme
<p/>; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and utter distrust of the sincerity of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) refusal to yield him (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) up; bitter disappointment at the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Claypole</b></font>) revenge on Sikes; the fear of detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all; these were the passionate considerations which, following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) sat without changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) attitude in the least, or appearing to take the smallest heed of time, until his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) crept upstairs to the door, and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who carried a bundle under one arm.
<p/>At last,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dry and fevered mouth. <div class="bookquote">` At last!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The bell rang gently as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke. Sitting down and throwing back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) said, laying the bundle on the table. <div class="bookquote">` Take care of that, and do the most you can with it.
<p/>It's been trouble enough to get; I thought I should have been here, three hours ago.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Fagin laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard, sat down again without speaking.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) did not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyes off the robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over against each other, face to face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) looked fixedly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) lips quivering so violently, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) chair, and surveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) with a look of real affright. `
<p/>Fagin raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) right hand, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) trembling forefinger in the air; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the moment gone. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Wot now?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes. <div class="bookquote">` Wot do you look at a man so for?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>Damme!' said Sikes, feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) breast with a look of alarm. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'s gone mad. I must look to myself here.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR.

<p/>Oh, you haven't, haven't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, looking sternly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I've no --no fault to find with you.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` That's lucky--for one of us. Which one that is, don't matter.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I've got that to tell you, Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR.

FAGIN</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Aye?'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>returned the robber with an incredulous air. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Tell away! Look sharp, or Nance will think I'm lost.'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Lost!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR.

 (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><p/>Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew's face, and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) coat collar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) huge hand and shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) soundly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Speak, will you!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">`or if you don't, it shall be for want of breath. Open your mouth and say wot you've got to say in plain words.
<p/>Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Suppose that lad that's laying there--'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>Fagin began. Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had not previously observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Suppose that lad,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>pursued Fagin, <div class="bookquote">`was to peach--to blow upon us all--first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having a meeting with 'em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be most easily taken.
<p/>Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was to do all this, and besides to blow upon a plant we've all been in, more or less--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own fancy; not grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread
<p/>and water,--but of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own fancy; to please his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own taste; stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us, and peaching to them.
<p/>Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) said, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) former position. <div class="bookquote">` Do you hear me?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyes flashing with rage. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was left alive till I came, I'd grind his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) head.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Jew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`

(<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin almost in a yell. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I, that knows so much, and could hang so many besides myself!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR.

<p/>I'd do something in the jail that <div class="bookquote">`ud get me put in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I'd fall upon you with them in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people.
<p/>I should have such strength,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>muttered the robber, poising his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) brawny arm, <div class="bookquote">`that I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it.'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You would?'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Would I!'

<p/>Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) to be silent, stooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>).
<p/>Sikes leant forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) chair: looking on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't care who,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>replied Sikes impatiently. <div class="bookquote">` Whoever it was, I'd serve them the same.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>Bolter, Bolter! Poor lad!' said Fagin, looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'s tired--tired with watching for her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) so long,--watching for her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) , Bill.'

(<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>asked Sikes, drawing back.

<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) assumed name had been repeated several times, Noah rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked sleepily about him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Tell me that again--once again, just for him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) to hear,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the Jew, pointing to Sikes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">` Tell yer what?'

<p/>That about-- Nancy ,'  (<font color='red'><b>Noah/Mr. Claypole/Noah Claypole</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) leaving the house before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had heard enough. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`A gentleman and a lady that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had gone to of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own accord before, who asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to give up all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pals, and Monks first, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did--and to describe him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did--and to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) what house it was that we meet at, and go to, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did--and where it could be best watched from, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did--and what time the people went there, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did.

<p/>They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken. <div class="bookquote">` I mean,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) felt all disguise was now useless, <div class="bookquote">`not too violent for safety.
<p/>Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.
<p/>Without one pause, or moment's consideration; without once turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) head to the right or left, or raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) eyes to the sky, or lowering them to the ground, but looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) with savage resolution: his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) skin;
<p/>the robber held on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) headlong course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the stairs; and entering his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) own room, double-locked the door, and lifting a heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed.
<p/>Be crafty, Bill, and not too bold.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) had roused her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sleep, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) raised herself with a hurried and startled look. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Get up!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the man. <div class="bookquote">` It is you, Bill!'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) return. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>was the reply. <div class="bookquote">`Get up.'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>There was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick, and hurled it under the grate.
<p/>Seeing the faint light of early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain. <div class="bookquote">` Let it be,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There's enough light for wot I've got to do.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, <div class="bookquote">`why do you look like that at me!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The robber sat regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils and heaving breast; and then, grasping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) by the head and throat, dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the door, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) heavy hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bill, Bill!'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal fear,--`I--I won't scream or cry--not once--hear me--speak to me--tell me what I have done!'
<p/><div class="bookquote">`You know, you she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) devil!'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>returned the robber, suppressing his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) breath. <div class="bookquote">` You were watched to-night; every word you said was heard.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Then spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>rejoined the girl, clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). ` Bill, dear Bill, you cannot have the heart to kill me.
<p/>You shall have time to think, and save yourself this crime; I will not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off.
<p/>Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one night, for you. Bill, Bill, for dear God's sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my blood!
<p/>The man struggled violently, to release his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms; but those of the girl were clasped round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and tear her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not tear them away. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, striving to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) breast, <div class="bookquote">`the gentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace.
<p/>Let me see them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and goodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far apart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived, except in prayers, and never see each other more.
<p/>I have been true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>It is never too late to repent. They told me so--I feel it now--but we must have time--a little, little time!'
<p/>The certainty of immediate detection if he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) fired, flashed across his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mind even in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) fury; and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) beat it twice with all the force he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could summon, upon the upturned face that almost touched his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) staggered and fell: nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty, on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knees, drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) bosom a white handkerchief--
<p/>Rose Maylie's own--and holding it up, in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) folded hands, as high towards Heaven as her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Maker.
<p/>The murderer staggering backward to the wall, and shutting out the sight with his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) hand, seized a heavy club and struck her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) down.
<p/>The housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) pistol. It was a ghastly figure to look upon. CHAPTER XLVIII THE FLIGHT OF SIKES
<p/>Of all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed within wide London's bounds since night hung over it, that was the worst.
<p/>Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air, that was the foulest and most cruel.
<p/>The sun--the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new life, and hope, and freshness to man--burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory.
<p/>Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed its equal ray. It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay.
<p/>If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all that brilliant light!
<p/>It did. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to shut it out, but it would stream in. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not moved; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been afraid to stir.
<p/>There had been a moan and motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had struck and struck again.
<p/>Once he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), than to see them glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had plucked it off again. And there was the body--mere flesh and blood, no more--but such flesh, and so much blood!
<p/>There was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder, and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney.
<p/>Even that frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sturdy as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held the weapon till it broke, and then piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) washed himself, and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes; there were spots that would not be removed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cut the pieces out, and burnt them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. How those stains were dispersed about the room!
<p/>The very feet of the dog were bloody. All this time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, never once, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back upon the corpse; no, not for a moment.
<p/>Such preparations completed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved, backward, towards the door: dragging the dog with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), lest he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should soil his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside.
<p/>There was the curtain still drawn, which she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have opened to admit the light she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never saw again. It lay nearly under there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that. God, how the sun poured down upon the very spot! The glance was instantaneous. It was a relief to have got free of the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the right again, almost as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Whittington</b></font>) began to descend it; and taking the foot-path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on Hampstead Heath.
<p/>Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North End, in one of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) laid himself down under a hedge, and slept.
<p/>Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) was up again, and away,--not far into the country, but back towards London by the high-road--then back again--then over another part of the same ground as he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) already traversed--then wandering up and down in fields, and lying on ditches' brinks to rest, and starting up to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away. Where could he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat and drink?
<p/>Thither he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) steps,--running sometimes, and sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail's pace, or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick.
<p/>Hendon. That was a good place, not far off, and out of most people's way. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) got there, all the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) met--the very children at the doors--seemed to view him (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) with suspicion.
<p/>Back he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) turned again, without the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) had tasted no food for many hours; and once more he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) lingered on the Heath, uncertain where to go.
<p/>Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round, and still lingered about the same spot.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the old place. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) got away, and shaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) course for Hatfield.
<p/>It was nine o'clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little street, crept into a small public-house, whose scanty light had guided them to the spot.
<p/>They made room for the stranger, but he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sat down in the furthest corner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) dog: to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) cast a morsel of food from time to time.
<p/>The conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the neighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted, upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous Sunday; the young men present considering him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very old, and the old men present declaring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to have been quite young--not older, one white-haired grandfather said, than he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was--with ten or fifteen year of life in him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) at least--if he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had taken care; if he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had taken care.
<p/>There was a fire in the tap-room, and some country-labourers were drinking before it. There was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this.
<p/>The robber, after paying his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer.
<p/>This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors, washballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap perfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) carried in a case slung to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) back.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) supper, and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) box of treasures, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And what be that stoof? Good to eat, Harry?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked a grinning countryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This,'  (<font color='red'><b>a countryman</b></font>)</div>said the fellow, producing one, <div class="bookquote">`this is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt, mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen, cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or woollen stuff.
<p/>Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition. If a lady stains her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) honour, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has only need to swallow one cake
<p/>If a gentleman wants to prove this, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has only need to bolt one little square, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has put it beyond question--for it's quite as satisfactory as a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it.
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s cured at once-- for it's poison. One penny a square. With all these virtues, one penny a square!'  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow composition</b></font>)</div>There were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly hesitated.
<p/>The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity. <div class="bookquote">` It's all bought up as fast as it can be made,'  (<font color='red'><b>The vendor</b></font>)</div>said the fellow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There are fourteen water-mills, six steam-engines, and a galvanic battery, always a-working upon it, and they can't make it fast enough, though the men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned directly, with twenty pound a-year for each of the children, and a premium of fifty for twins.
<p/>One penny a square! Two half-pence is all the same, and four farthings is received with joy. One penny a square!
<p/>Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company, that I'll take clean out, before he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) can order me a pint of ale.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll take it clean out, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, winking to the company, `before you can come across the room to get it.
<p/>Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, mud-stains, blood-stains! <div class="bookquote">`Hah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes starting up. <div class="bookquote">` Give that back.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>Gentlemen all, observe the dark stain upon this gentleman's hat, no wider than a shilling, but thicker than a half-crown.
<p/>Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain, beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or blood-stain--' The man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table, and tearing the hat from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), burst out of the house.
<p/>With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was not followed, and that they most probably considered him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) some drunken sullen fellow, turned back up the town, and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the street, was walking past, when he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) recognised the mail from London, and saw that it was standing at the little post-office.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) almost knew what was to come; but he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) crossed over, and listened. The guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag.
<p/>A man, dressed like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a basket which lay ready on the pavement. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That's for your people,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the guard. ` Now, look alive in there, will you. Damn that <div class="bookquote">`ere bag , it warn't ready night afore last; this won't do, you know!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div><p/>Anything new up in town, Ben?' asked the game-keeper, drawing back to the window-shutters, the better to admire the horses. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` No, nothing that I knows on,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, pulling on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gloves. <div class="bookquote">` Corn's up a little. I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields way, but I don't reckon much upon it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Oh, that's quite true,'  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>said a gentleman inside, who was looking out of the window. <div class="bookquote">` And a dreadful murder it was.'
 (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Was it, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>rejoined the guard, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">` Man or woman, pray, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` A woman,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is supposed--'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Now, Ben,'  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>replied the coachman impatiently. ` Damn that <div class="bookquote">`ere bag,'  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>said the guard; <div class="bookquote">`are you gone to sleep in there?'  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>Ah, and so's the young <div class="bookquote">`ooman of property that's going to take a fancy to me, but I don't know when.
<p/>Coming!'  (<font color='red'><b>the office keeper</b></font>)</div>cried the office keeper, running out. <div class="bookquote">` Coming,'  (<font color='red'><b>the office keeper</b></font>)</div>growled the guard. <div class="bookquote">` Here, give hold. All ri--ight!'  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone.
<p/>Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) went on doggedly; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) left the town behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) felt a dread and awe creeping upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) which shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) to the core.
<p/>Every object before him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) of that morning's ghastly figure following at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) heels.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry.
<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) went back again, and took the road which leads from Hatfield to St. Albans. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) stopped it did the same.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) ran, it followed--not running too: that would have been a relief: but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell.
<p/>At times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat this phantom off, though it should look him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) dead; but the hair rose on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) blood stood still, for it had turned with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) and was behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) then.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) had kept it before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) that morning, but it was behind now--always. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) back against a bank, and felt that it stood above him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>), visibly out against the cold night-sky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) threw himself upon the road--on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) back upon the road. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) head it stood, silent, erect, and still--a living grave-stone, with its epitaph in blood.
<p/>Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence must sleep. There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear.
<p/>Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not walk on, till daylight came again; and here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stretched himself close to the wall--to undergo new torture.
<p/>There was a shed in a field he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed, that offered shelter for the night. For now, a vision came before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as constant and more terrible than that from which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had escaped.
<p/>Those widely staring eyes, so lustreless and so glassy, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had better borne to see them than think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness:
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shut out the sight, there came the room with every well-known object--some, indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have forgotten, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone over its contents from memory--each in its accustomed place.
<p/>light in themselves, but giving light to nothing. There were but two, but they were everywhere. The body was in its place, and its eyes were as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw them when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stole away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up, and rushed into the field without. The figure was behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once more.
<p/>And here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained in such terror as none but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can know, trembling in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting, and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder.
<p/>Any sound of men in that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm, was something to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regained his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger; and springing to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, rushed into the open air.
<p/>Rising into the air with showers of sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood.
<p/>The eyes were there, before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had laid himself along. The broad sky seemed on fire. The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear the cry of Fire!
<p/>mingled with the ringing of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though refreshed by food.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) darted onward--straight, headlong--dashing through brier and brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dog, who careered with loud and sounding bark before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The noise increased as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked. There were people there--men and women--light, bustle. It was like new life to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came upon the spot.
<p/>There were half-dressed figures tearing to and fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables, others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling down of red-hot beams.
<p/>The apertures, where doors and windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron poured down, white hot, upon the ground.
<p/>The clanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar.
<p/>Women and children shrieked, and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shouted, too, till he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself, plunged into the thickest of the throng.
<p/>Hither and thither he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) dived that night: now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest.
<p/>Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) weight, under the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire was he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise, nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke and blackened ruins remained.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) looked suspiciously about him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), for the men were conversing in groups, and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) feared to be the subject of their talk.
<p/>This mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the dreadful consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) crime. The dog obeyed the significant beck of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) finger, and they drew off, stealthily, together.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) took some bread and meat; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) drank a draught of beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the murder. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has gone to Birmingham, they say,'  (<font color='red'><b>the firemen</b></font>)</div>said one: <div class="bookquote">`but they'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there'll be a cry all through the country.'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hurried off, and walked till he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) almost dropped upon the ground; then lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) passed near an engine where some men were seated, and they called to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to share in their refreshment. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night.
<p/>Suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) took the desperate resolution to going back to London. <div class="bookquote">` There's somebody to speak to there, at all event,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A good hiding-place, too. They'll never expect to nab me there, after this country scent. Why can't I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt from Fagin, get abroad to France?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least frequented roads began his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) journey back, resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) had fixed on for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) destination.
<p/>If any description of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) were out, it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) resolved to drown him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), and walked on, looking about for a pond: picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) handkerchief as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) went.
<p/>The animal looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) master's face while these preparations were making; whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) instinct apprehended something of their purpose, or the robber's sidelong look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) was sterner than ordinary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and cowered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) came more slowly along.
<p/>Damme, I'll risk it.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The dog, though. This might lead to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) apprehension as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) passed along the streets. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) master halted at the brink of a pool, and looked round to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) stopped outright. `
<p/>The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) throat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) uttered a low growl and started back. <div class="bookquote">`Come back!'  (<font color='red'><b>the robber</b></font>)</div>said the robber.
<p/>Do you hear me call? Come here!' cried Sikes. The dog wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) tail, but moved not. Sikes made a running noose and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) again.
<p/>The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hardest speed. The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the expectation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) would return.
<p/>But no dog appeared, and at length he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) journey. CHAPTER XLIX MONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET. THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE INTELLIGENCE
<p/>The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow alighted from a hackney-coach at his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) own door, and knocked softly.
<p/>The door being opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood upon the other side.
<p/>At a sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) between them, hurried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the house.
<p/>They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr. Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room.
<p/>THAT INTERRUPTS IT This man was Monks. At the door of this apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance, stopped.
<p/>The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows the alternative,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Browlow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Browlow</b></font>) hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Browlow</b></font>), drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Browlow</b></font>) into the street, call for the aid of the police, and impeach him (<font color='blue'><b>Browlow</b></font>) as a felon in my name.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`How dare you say this of me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks. <div class="bookquote">` How dare you urge me to it, young man?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, confronting him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) with a steady look. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Are you mad enough to leave this house? Unhand him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>). There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow.
<p/>But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery.
<p/>I am resolute and immoveable. If you are determined to be the same, your blood be upon your own head!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>By what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by these dogs?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If you complain of being deprived of your liberty--you had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it advisable to remain quiet--
<p/>By mine,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">` Those persons are indemnified by me. I say again, throw yourself for protection on the law.
<p/>I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too far to recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have passed into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed, yourself.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Monks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">` You will decide quickly,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness and composure. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a shudder, foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the way.
<p/>If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair.
<p/>It has waited for you two whole days.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>Monks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still. <div class="bookquote">` You will be prompt,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have not the inclination to parley,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`and, as I advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>A word from me, and the alternative has gone for ever.' Still the man hesitated. ` <div class="bookquote">` Is there--'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,--`is there--no middle course?' `
<p/>Monks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the room, and, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shoulders, sat down. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>None.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>Lock the door on the outside,' said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants, <div class="bookquote">`and come when I ring.'  (<font color='red'><b>the attendants</b></font>)</div>The men obeyed, and the two were left alone together. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is because I was your father's oldest friend, young man,'  (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), and that fair creature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) blood and kindred who rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) God in youth, and left me here a solitary, lonely man: it is because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knelt with me beside his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only sisters's death-bed when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was yet a boy, on the morning that would--but Heaven willed otherwise--have made her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) my young wife
<p/>; it is because my seared heart clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), from that time forth, through all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trials and errors, till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died; it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you gently now--yes, Edward Leeford, even now--and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What has the name to do with it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>asked the other, after contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the agitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leeford</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This is pretty treatment, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said Monks, throwing down his (<font color='blue'><b>Leeford</b></font>) hat and cloak, <div class="bookquote">`from my father's oldest friend.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What is the name to me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But it was hers , and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a stranger.
<p/>This is all mighty fine,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks -LRB-to retain his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) assumed designation-RRB- after a long silence, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`nothing to you. I am very glad you have changed it--very--very.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` But what do you want with me?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You have a brother,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself: <div class="bookquote">`a brother, the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither, in wonder and alarm.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` I have no brother,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>replied Monks. <div class="bookquote">` You know I was an only child. Why do you talk to me of brothers?
<p/>You know that, as well as I.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Attend to what I do know, and you may not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I know that of the wretched marriage, into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole and most unnatural issue.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I shall interest you by and by. I don't care for hard names,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh. <div class="bookquote">` You know the fact, and that's enough for me.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both.
<p/>I know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave place to dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space apart, carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death could break the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume.
<p/>But I also know,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>pursued the old gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`the misery, the slow torture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union. Your mother succeeded; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forgot it soon.
<p/>But it rusted and cankered at your father's heart for years.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well, they were separated,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, <div class="bookquote">`and what of that?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`When they had been separated for some time,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`and your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had utterly forgotten the young husband
<p/>ten good years her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) junior, who, with prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fell among new friends. This circumstance, at least, you know already.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>Not I,' said Monks, turning away his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes and beating his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) foot upon the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Your manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty--for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was, I repeat, a boy, when his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to marry.
<p/>Must I go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will you spare it, and disclose to me the truth?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>These new friends, then,' said Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`were a naval officer retired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year before, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) with two children--there had been more, but, of all their family, happily but two survived.
<p/>They were both daughters; one a beautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two or three years old.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>`
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Not I.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">`I have nothing to disclose,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>rejoined Monks. <div class="bookquote">` You must talk on if you will.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What's this to me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>asked Monks. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They resided,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the interruption, `in a part of the country to which your father in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wandering had repaired, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had taken up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) abode.
<p/>Acquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other. Your father was gifted as few men are. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sister's soul and person.
<p/>As the old officer knew him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) more and more, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) grew to love him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>). I would that it had ended there.
<p/>The old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lips, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) immediately resumed: <div class="bookquote">`The end of a year found him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) contracted, solemnly contracted, to that daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a guileless girl.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Brownlow, <div class="bookquote">`and such tales usually are;
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) daughter did the same.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>Your tale is of the longest,' observed Monks, moving restlessly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">` if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness, it would be very brief.
<p/>At length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed, as others are often--it is no uncommon case--died, and to repair the misery he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been instrumental in occasioning, left him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) panacea for all griefs--Money.
<p/>It was necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should immediately repair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had died, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affairs in great confusion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went; was seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died the day after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arrival, leaving no will-- no will --so that the whole property fell to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and you.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>At this part of the recital Monks held his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath, and listened with a face of intense eagerness, though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were not directed towards the speaker.
<p/>As Mr. Brownlow paused, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hot face and hands. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) went abroad, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) passed through London on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) way,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) eyes upon the other's face, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) came to me.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>I never heard of that,' interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture--a portrait painted by himself--a likeness of this poor girl--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) did not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hasty journey.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself; confided to me his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) intention to convert his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) whole property, at any loss, into money, and, having settled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) wife and you a portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) recent acquisition, to fly the country--I guessed too well he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) would not fly alone--and never see it more.
<p/>Even from me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) old and early friend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to both--even from me he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) withheld any more particular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after that to see me once again, for the last time on earth.
<p/>I went,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, `I went, when all was over, to the scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)--I will use the term the world would freely use, for
<p/>worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>).
<p/>The family had left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place by night.

<p/>Monks drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of triumph. <div class="bookquote">` By me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I told you I should interest you before long. I say by me--I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name,
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from sickness in my house, his (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of, struck me with astonishment.
<p/>Even when I first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) in all his (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) dirt and misery, there was a lingering expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream.
<p/>although for ought he (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) knew, it would be quite strange to your ears. I need not tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) was snared away before I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) history--'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why not?'

<p/>Your mother being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the West Indies--whither, as you well know, you retired upon your mother's death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here--I made the voyage.
<p/>You had left it, months before, and were supposed to be in London, but no one could tell where. I returned.
<p/>You came and went, they said, as strangely as you had ever done: sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months: keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy.

<p/>Your agents had no clue to your residence. I wearied them with new applications. And now you do see me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, rising boldly, <div class="bookquote">`what then?
<p/>Fraud and robbery are high-sounding words--justified, you think, by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man's Brother!

<p/>You have a brother; you know it, and him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret and the gain to you at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own death.
<p/>It contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was born, and accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were first awakened by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) resemblance to your father.
<p/>Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in your own words to your accomplice the Jew, '' the only proofs of the boy's identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) coffin .
<p/>Unworthy son, coward, liar,--you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night,--you, whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you,--you, who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father's heart, and in whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind--
<p/>You repaired to the place of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) birth. There existed proofs--proofs long suppressed--of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) birth and parentage. '' you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!'

<p/>CHAPTER L THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close-built low-roofed houses
<p/>, there exists the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of its inhabitants.
<p/>To reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion.
<p/>The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman's door, and stream from the house-parapet and windows.
<p/>Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class, ballast-heavers, coal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the raff and refuse of the river, he (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) makes his (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) way with difficulty along, assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner.
<p/>Arriving, at length, in streets remoter and less-frequented than those through which he (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) has passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) walks beneath tottering house-fronts projecting over the pavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) passes,
<p/>chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect.
<p/>In such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark, stands Jacob's Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill Pond, but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch.
<p/>It is a creek or inlet from the Thames, and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name.
<p/>At such times, a stranger, looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows, buckets, pails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the water up; and when his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).
<p/>Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and threatening to fall into it--as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the banks of Folly Ditch.
<p/>In Jacob's Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke.
<p/>Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon it, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed.
<p/>The houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by those who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die.
<p/>They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob's Island.
<p/>In an upper room of one of these houses--a detached house of fair size, ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window: of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described--there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation, sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence.
<p/>One of these was Toby Crackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty years, whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion.
<p/>I will remain here.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>The two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable. This man was a returned transport, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name was Kags. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I wish,'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, <div class="bookquote">`that you had picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come here, my fine feller.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, I thought you'd have been a little more glad to see me than this,' replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, look`e, young gentleman,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div>said Toby, <div class="bookquote">`when a man keeps himself so very ex-clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it's rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman -LRB-however respectable and pleasant a person he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) may be to play cards with at conweniency-RRB- circumstanced as you are.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><p/>Especially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), that's arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts, and is too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) return,' added Mr. Kags.
<p/>There was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) usual devil-may-care swagger, turned to Chitling and said, <div class="bookquote">`When was Fagin took then?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><p/>Charley and I made our lucky up the wash-us chimney, and Bolter got into the empty water-butt, head downwards; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top, and so they took him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) too.' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>replied Chitling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) countenance falling more and more, <div class="bookquote">`and went off mad, screaming and raving, and beating her (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) head against the boards; so they put a strait-weskut on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) to the hospital--and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) is.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why didn't you, blunder-head!'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>said Kags. ` ` <div class="bookquote">`Just at dinner-time--two o'clock this afternoon. And Bet?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`Poor Bet! <div class="bookquote">` Wot's come of young Bates?'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>demanded Kags. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There's nowhere else to go to now, for the people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)'ll be here soon,'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>replied Chitling. <div class="bookquote">` --I went up there and see it with my own eyes--is filled with traps.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The sessions are on,'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>said Kags: <div class="bookquote">`if they get the inquest over, and Bolter turns King's evidence: as of course he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)'s said already: they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and get the trial on on Friday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>)'ll swing in six days from this, by G--!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div><p/>This is a smash,' observed Toby, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">` There's more than one will go with this.'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">` You should have heard the people groan,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div>said Chitling; <div class="bookquote">`the officers fought like devils, or they'd have torn him (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) away.
<p/>You should have seen how he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>), all muddy and bleeding, and clung to them as if they were his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) dearest friends.
<p/>I can see 'em now, not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) along amongst 'em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and snarling with their teeth and making at him (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>); I can see the blood upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore they'd tear his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) heart out!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chitling/Chitling</b></font>)</div><p/>The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) ears, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro, like one distracted.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Chitling</b></font>) was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs, and Sikes's dog bounded into the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was down once, but they made a ring round him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), and fought their way along. They ran to the window, downstairs, and into the street.
<p/>The dog had jumped in at an open window; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) made no attempt to follow them, nor was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) master to be seen. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was coming here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>)'d have come with the dog,'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>said Kags, stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What's the meaning of this?'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>said Toby when they had returned. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) can't be coming here. I--I--hope not.'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>Here! Give us some water for him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) has run himself faint.' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)'s drunk it all up, every drop,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence. <div class="bookquote">` Covered with mud--lame--half blind--he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) must have come a long way.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)'s been to the other kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)'s been many a time and often.
<p/>But where can he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) have come from first, and how comes he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) here alone without the other!' <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)' (<font color='red'><b>the murderer</b></font>)</div>---LRB-none of them called the murderer by his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) old name-RRB---`He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) can't have made away with himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Where can he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) have come from!'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Toby. <div class="bookquote">` What do you think?'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>said Chitling. Toby shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">` If he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) had,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>said Kags, `the dog <div class="bookquote">`ud want to lead us away to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) did it.
<p/>No. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)'s got out of the country, and left the dog behind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) must have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) the slip somehow, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) wouldn't be so easy.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div><p/>This solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep, without more notice from anybody.
<p/>The terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position.
<p/>It being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and placed upon the table. They drew their chairs closer together, starting at every sound.
<p/>They spoke little, and that in whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room.
<p/>They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below. <div class="bookquote">` Young Bates,'  (<font color='red'><b>Kags</b></font>)</div>said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) felt himself.
<p/>The knocking came again. No, it wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) never knocked like that. Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) head.
<p/>There was no need to tell them who it was; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) pale face was enough. The dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the door. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We must let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) in,'  (<font color='red'><b>The dog</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) said, taking up the candle. <div class="bookquote">` Isn't there any help for it?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked the other man in a hoarse voice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't leave us in the dark,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said Kags, taking down a candle from the chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had finished.
<p/>Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) head under his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) hat.
<p/>Blanched face, sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days' growth, wasted flesh, short thick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room, but shuddering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall--as close as it would go--and ground it against it--and sat down.
<p/>None. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) must come in.' ` He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) drew them slowly off. Not a word had been exchanged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) looked from one to another in silence.
<p/>If an eye were furtively raised and met his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), it was instantly averted. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hollow voice broke silence, they all three started.
<p/>They seemed never to have heard its tones before. <div class="bookquote">` How came that dog here?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">` Alone. Three hours ago.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`To-night's paper says that Fagin's took.
<p/>Is it true, or a lie?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`True.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They were silent again. <div class="bookquote">` Damn you all!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You that keep this house,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) face to Crackit, <div class="bookquote">`do you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div><p/>Have you nothing to say to me?' There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke. ` <div class="bookquote">`You may stop here, if you think it safe,'  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>returned the person addressed, after some hesitation.
<p/>Sikes carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes slowly up the wall behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>): rather trying to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) head than actually doing it: and said, <div class="bookquote">`Is--it--the body--is it buried?'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They shook their heads. <div class="bookquote">` Why isn't it!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) retorted with the same glance behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Wot do they keep such ugly things above the ground for?--Who's that knocking?'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Crackit intimated, by a motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) left the room, that there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>).
<p/>Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy entered the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) encountered his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) figure. <div class="bookquote">` Toby,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) eyes towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`why didn't you tell me this, downstairs?'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad.
<p/>Accordingly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nodded, and made as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would shake hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Let me go into some other room,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the boy, retreating still farther. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Don't come nearer me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>answered the boy, still retreating, and looking, with horror in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes, upon the murderer's face. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Charley!'  (<font color='red'><b>the murderer</b></font>)</div>said Sikes, stepping forward. <div class="bookquote">` Don't you--don't you know me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>You monster!' The man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes's eyes sunk gradually to the ground. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Witness you three,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sikes/Mr. Sikes/Mr. William Sikes</b></font>)</div>cried the boy shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clenched fist, and becoming more and more excited as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">` Witness you three
<p/>--I'm not afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--if they come here after him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up; I will. I tell you out at once.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) may kill me for it if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) likes, or if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dares, but if I am here I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up.
<p/>I'd give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was to be boiled alive. Murder! Help! If there's the pluck of a man among you three, you'll help me.
<p/>Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the strong man, and in the intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) energy and the suddenness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) surprise, brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heavily to the ground.
<p/>They offered no interference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the former, heedless of the blows that showered upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), wrenching his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer's breast, and never ceasing to call for help with all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might.
<p/>Sikes had him (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) down, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) knee was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sikes</b></font>) throat, when Crackit pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) back with a look of alarm, and pointed to the window.
<p/>There were lights gleaming below, voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried footsteps--endless they seemed in number--crossing the nearest wooden bridge.
<p/>One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement.
<p/>Murder! Help! Down with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The three spectators seemed quite stupefied. The contest, however, was too unequal to last long. The gleam of lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on.
<p/>Then, came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Help!'  (<font color='red'><b>a multitude</b></font>)</div>shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s here! Break down the door!'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` In the King's name,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry arose again, but louder. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Break down the door!'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>screamed the boy. ` I tell you they'll never open it. Run straight to the room where the light is.
<p/>Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower window-shutters as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of its immense extent. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching Hell-babe,'  (<font color='red'><b>the listener</b></font>)</div>cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the boy, now, as easily as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were an empty sack. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Is the downstairs door fast?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Double-locked and chained,'  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Crackit/Mr. Crackit</b></font>)</div>replied Crackit, who, with the other two men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Break down the door!'  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>That door. Quick!' He (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Crackit</b></font>) in, bolted it, and turned the key. <div class="bookquote">` The panels--are they strong?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Lined with sheet-iron.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And the windows too?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, and the windows.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Damn you!'  (<font color='red'><b>the ruffian</b></font>)</div>cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do your worst! I'll cheat you yet!'  (<font color='red'><b>the ruffian</b></font>)</div>Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng.
<p/>Some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>officers</b></font>) dead.
<p/>Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on horseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting through the crowd as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were parting water, cried, beneath the window, in a voice that rose above all others, <div class="bookquote">`Twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder!'
 (<font color='red'><b>all others</b></font>)</div><p/>Some called for ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of those below; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water-spout and crevices in the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the darkness beneath, like a field of corn moved by an angry wind: and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The tide,'  (<font color='red'><b>madmen</b></font>)</div>cried the murderer, as he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) staggered back into the room, and shut the faces out, <div class="bookquote">`the tide was in as I came up.
<p/>The nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it. Give me a rope, a long rope. They're all in front.
<p/>I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and clear off that way. Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders and kill myself.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up to the house-top.
<p/>All the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up, except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that was too small even for the passage of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) body.
<p/>But, from this aperture, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the back; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by the door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front, who immediately began to pour round, pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) planted a board, which he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had carried up with him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) for the purpose, so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over the low parapet.
<p/>The crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) motions and doubtful of his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) purpose, but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers.
<p/>Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning, took up the sound; it echoed and re-echoed; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>).
<p/>On pressed the people from the front--on, on, on, in a strong struggling current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion.
<p/>The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob; sashes were thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every house-top.
<p/>The water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud. Again and again it rose. Each little bridge -LRB-and there were three in sight-RRB- bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it.
<p/>Still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only for an instant see the wretch. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They have him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) now,'  (<font color='red'><b>the wretch</b></font>)</div>cried a man on the nearest bridge. <div class="bookquote">` Hurrah!'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>The crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I will give fifty pounds,'  (<font color='red'><b>an gentleman</b></font>)</div>cried an old gentleman from the same quarter, <div class="bookquote">`to the man who takes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) alive. I will remain here, till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come to ask me for it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>an gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room.
<p/>The stream abruptly turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at the windows, seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their stations, and running into the street, joined the concourse that now thronged pell-mell to the spot they had left: each man crushing and striving with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near the door, and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out.
<p/>The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation, or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time, between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass, the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer, although the universal eagerness for his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) capture was, if possible, increased.
<p/>The man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sprang upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, determined to make one last effort for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life by dropping into the ditch, and, at the risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion.
<p/>Roused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and teeth almost in a second.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own height, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knife ready in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to cut it then and drop.
<p/>At the very instant when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought the loop over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head previous to slipping it beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm-pits, and when the old gentleman before-mentioned -LRB-who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position-RRB- earnestly warned those about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the man was about to lower himself down--at that very instant the murderer, looking behind him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) on the roof, threw his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) arms above his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) head, and uttered a yell of terror. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There was another roar. The eyes again!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) cried in an unearthly screech. Staggering as if struck by lightning, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) balance and tumbled over the parapet.
<p/>The noose was on his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) neck. It ran up with his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) weight, tight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds.
<p/>There was a sudden jerk, a terrific convulsion of the limbs; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) hung, with the open knife clenched in his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) stiffening hand.
<p/>The murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) view, called to the people to come and take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out, for God's sake.
<p/>A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man's shoulders.
<p/>Missing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aim, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell into the ditch, turning completely over as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went; and striking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head against a stone, dashed out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brains.
<p/>CHAPTER LI AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN-MONEY
<p/>The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when Oliver found himself, at three o'clock in the afternoon, in a travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) native town.
<p/>Mrs. Maylie, and Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>): and Mr. Brownlow followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned.
<p/>They had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) of the power of collecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr. Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense.
<p/>The same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne's assistance, cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It was quite true,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Losberne/Losberne</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`that they must know them before long, but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be at a worse.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) fell for five-and-thirty feet. The old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. So, they travelled on in silence:
<p/>each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together: and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all.
<p/>But if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they journeyed towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) birth-place by a road he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had never seen, how the whole current of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) recollections ran back to old times, and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) breast, when they turned into that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had traversed on foot: a poor houseless, wandering boy, without a friend to help him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), or a roof to shelter his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) head. `
<p/>cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose, and pointing out at the carriage window; <div class="bookquote">`that's the stile I came over; there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake me and force me back!
<p/>See there, there!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to the old house where I was a little child!
<p/>Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old friend, if I could only see you now!' <div class="bookquote">`You will see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) soon,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>replied Rose, gently taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) folded hands between her (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) how happy you are, and how rich you have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) happy too.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>we'll take him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) away from here, and have him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) clothed and taught, and send him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) to some quiet country place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) may grow strong and well,--shall we?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, yes,' said Oliver, `and we'll-- Rose nodded <div class="bookquote">`yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rose/Miss Rose</b></font>)</div>for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) could not speak. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It will make you cry, I know, to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) can tell; but never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile again--
<p/>You will be kind and good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), for you are to every one,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` I know that too--to think how changed he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is; you did the same with me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) said ``God bless you'' to me when I ran away,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion; <div class="bookquote">`and I will say ``God bless you'' now, and show him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) how I love him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for it!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>As they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds.
<p/>There was Sowerberry's the undertaker's just as it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) remembered it--there were all the well-known shops and houses, with almost every one of which he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) had some slight incident connected--there was Gamfield's cart, the very cart he (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) used to have, standing at the old public-house door--there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gamfield</b></font>) youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street--there was the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver involuntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so foolish, then cried, then laughed again--there were scores of faces at the doors and windows
<p/>--there was nearly everything as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had left it but yesterday, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) recent life had been but a happy dream.
<p/>They drove straight to the door of the chief hotel -LRB-which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe, and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size-RRB-; and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness, and not offering to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) head--no, not once; not even when he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and maintained he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) knew it best, though he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had only come that way once, and that time fast asleep.
<p/>that he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) knew quite well But it was pure, earnest, joyful reality. There was dinner prepared, and there were bedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic.
<p/>Notwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour was over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down.
<p/>The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they were present, conversed apart.
<p/>Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained in a separate room. Once, Mrs. Maylie was called away, and after being absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping.
<p/>They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they exchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices.
<p/>At length, when nine o'clock had come, and they began to think they were to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered the room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see; for they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) brother, and it was the same man he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had met at the market-town, and seen looking in with Fagin at the window of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) little room.
<p/>Monks cast a look of hate, which, even then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could not dissemble, at the astonished boy, and sat down near the door.
<p/>All these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets, nervous and uncomfortable. Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) hand, walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This is a painful task,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`but these declarations, which have been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance repeated here.
<p/>I would have spared you the degradation, but we must hear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Go on,'
 (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div><p/>said the person addressed, turning away his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">` Quick.

<p/>This child,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The term you use,' said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, `is a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` It reflects disgrace on no one living, except you who use it. Let that pass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was born in this town.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>In the workhouse of this town,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the sullen reply. <div class="bookquote">` You have the story there.'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) pointed impatiently to the papers as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I must have it here, too,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the listeners. <div class="bookquote">` Listen then! You!'  (<font color='red'><b>the listeners</b></font>)</div>returned Monks. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) father being taken ill at Rome, was joined by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) wife, my mother, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had been long separated, who went from Paris and took me with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--to look after his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) property, for what I know, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no great affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), nor he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Among the papers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) desk, were two, dated on the night his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) illness first came on, directed to yourself' (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`and enclosed in a few short lines to you, with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was dead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) knew nothing of us, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) senses were gone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) slumbered on till next day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) died. One of these papers was a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` What of the letter?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">` The letter?--A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery--to be explained one day--prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) just then; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had gone on, trusting patiently to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), until she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) trusted too far, and lost what none could ever give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) all he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had meant to do, to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shame, if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had lived, and prayed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) died, not to curse his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) or their young child; for all the guilt was his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) of the day he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the little locket and the ring with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) christian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that
<p/>which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hoped one day to have bestowed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--prayed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) yet to keep it, and wear it next her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had done before--and then ran on, wildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had gone distracted.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, at that time, within a few months of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) confinement. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` The will,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver's tears fell fast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) talked of miseries which his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) wife had brought upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>); of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature bad passions of you his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) only son, who had been trained to hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>); and left you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds.
<p/>The bulk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) property he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) divided into two equal portions--one for Agnes Fleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born alive, and ever come of age.
<p/>If it were a girl, it was to inherit the money unconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) minority he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should never have stained his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name with any public act of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did this, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, to mark his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) confidence in the other, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) conviction--only strengthened by approaching death--that the child would share her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gentle heart, and noble nature.
<p/>Monks was silent. <div class="bookquote">` The will,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`was in the same spirit as the letter. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) were disappointed in this expectation, then the money was to come to you:
<p/>for then, and not till then, when both children were equal, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) recognise your prior claim upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) purse, who had none upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) with coldness and aversion.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My mother,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, in a louder tone, <div class="bookquote">`did what a woman should have done. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) burnt this will. The letter never reached its destination; but
<p/>The girl's father had the truth from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with every aggravation that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) violent hate--I love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for it now--could add.
<p/>Goaded by shame and dishonour he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fled with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) children into a remote corner of Wales, changing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) very name that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends might never know of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) retreat; and here, no great while afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was found dead in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bed.
<p/>The girl had left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) home, in secret, some weeks before; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had searched for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), on foot, in every town and village near; it was on the night when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) returned home, assured that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had destroyed herself, to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shame and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old heart broke.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>that, and other proofs, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kept, in case they ever tried to lie away the blot. There was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread of the narrative. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), when only eighteen; robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) of jewels and money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London: where for two years he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had associated with the lowest outcasts.
<p/>Years after this,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR.

She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was sinking under a painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him (<font color='blue'><b>Leeford</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died.
<p/>Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made. They were unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leeford</b></font>) went back with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to France.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>said Monks, <div class="bookquote">`after a lingering illness; and, on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death-bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved--though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child too, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born, and was alive.
<p/>I swore to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), if ever it crossed my path, to hunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply felt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by draggin it, if I could, to the very gallows-foot.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was right. He (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) came in my way at last. I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I would have finished as I began!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><p/>As the villain folded his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) arms tight together, and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), and explained that the Jew, who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver ensnared: of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) being rescued: and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>answered Monks without raising his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes. `
<p/>Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) unwilling consort after him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The locket and ring?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks. <div class="bookquote">` You know what became of them.'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>Do my hi's deceive me!' cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm, <div class="bookquote">`or is that little Oliver?
<p/>Oh O-li-ver, if you know'd how I've been a-grieving for you--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Hold your tongue, fool,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` Isn't natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?'

<p/>I always loved that boy as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d been my--my--my own grandfather,'  (<font color='red'><b>the workhouse master</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Master Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat? Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with plated handles, Oliver.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) inquired, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) pointed to Monks, <div class="bookquote">`Do you know that person?'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Monks</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Bumble flatly. <div class="bookquote">` Perhaps you don't?'

<p/>I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) in all my life,'  (<font color='red'><b>spouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">` Nor sold him (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) anything, perhaps?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bumble/Bumble</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Bumble. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bumble</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">` Certainly not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR.

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/>But not again did he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) return with a stout man and wife; for this time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) led in two palsied women, who shook and tottered as they walked. <div class="bookquote">`

<p/>The people were poor and began to sicken--at least the man did--of their fine humanity; so she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) left it with them, giving them a small present of money which would not last long, and promised more, which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never meant to send.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't quite rely, however, on their discontent and poverty for the child's unhappiness, but told the history of the sister's shame, with such alterations as suited her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); bade them take good heed of the child, for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) came of bad blood; and told them she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or other.
<p/>The circumstances countenanced all this; the people believed it; and there the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even to satisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at Chester, saw the girl by chance, pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and took her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) home.

<p/>If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I ever feel it, as I should to-night?

<p/>That a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shunned all--there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.'

(<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I mean but this--that when I left you last, I left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me; resolved that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine; that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn from it.
<p/>What do you mean!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) faltered. ` This I have done. Those who have shrunk from me because of this, have shrunk from you, and proved you so far right.

<p/>It is a world of disappointment: often to the hopes we most cherish, and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour.
<p/>What is the matter?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Maylie</b></font>)</div>Poor Dick was dead! CHAPTER LII FAGIN'S LAST NIGHT ALIVE The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces.
<p/>From the rail before the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man--Fagin.
<p/>Before him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) and behind: above, below, on the right and on the left: he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), the other held to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) ear, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) head thrust forward to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was delivering his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) charge to the jury.
<p/>At times, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) favour; and when the points against him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) were stated with terrible distinctness, looked towards his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) counsel, in mute appeal that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) would, even then, urge something in his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) behalf.
<p/>Inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space. Beyond these manifestations of anxiety, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) stirred not hand or foot.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had scarcely moved since the trial began; and now that the judge ceased to speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention, with his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) gaze bent on him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), as though he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) listened still.
<p/>A slight bustle in the court, recalled him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) to himself. Looking round, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) saw that the juryman had turned together, to consider their verdict.
<p/>As his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) eyes wandered to the gallery, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) could see the people rising above each other to see his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) face: some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes: and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence.
<p/>A few there were, who seemed unmindful of him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could delay.
<p/>But in no one face--not even among the women, of whom there were many there--could he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) read the faintest sympathy with himself, or any feeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) should be condemned.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness came again, and looking back he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was fruitless.
<p/>Hush! They only sought permission to retire. The jailer touched him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) on the shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) followed mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair.
<p/>The man pointed it out, or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not have seen it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked up into the gallery again. Some of the people were eating, and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place was very hot.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the artist broke his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) pencil-point, and made another with his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) knife, as any idle spectator might have done.
<p/>In the same way, when he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) eyes towards the judge, his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) dress, and what it cost, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) put it on.
<p/>There was an old fat gentleman on the bench, too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dinner, what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had it; and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye and roused another.
<p/>Not that, all this time, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind was, for an instant, free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet; it was ever present to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but in a vague and general way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not fix his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts upon it.
<p/>Thus, even while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trembled, and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell to counting the iron spikes before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and wondering how the head of one had been broken off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was.
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold--and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it--and then went on to think again.
<p/>There was one young man sketching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face in a little note-book. At length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all towards the door.
<p/>The jury returned, and passed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) close. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone.
<p/>The building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another, and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled out, like angry thunder.
<p/>Perfect stillness ensued--not a rustle--not a breath--Guilty. It was a peal of joy from the populace outside, greeting the news that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would die on Monday.
<p/>The noise subsided, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listening attitude, and looked intently at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) questioner while the demand was made; but it was twice repeated before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to hear it, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only muttered that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an old man--an old man--and
<p/>so, dropping into a whisper, was silent again. The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture.
<p/>A woman in the gallery, uttered some exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively.
<p/>The address was solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear. But he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) stood, like a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) haggard face was still thrust forward, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) under-jaw hanging down, and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) eyes staring out before him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), when the jailer put his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) arm, and beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) away.
<p/>They led him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard.
<p/>There was nobody there to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) ; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) passed, the prisoners fell back to render him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars: and they assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) with opprobrious names, and screeched and hissed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) fist, and would have spat upon them; but his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) conductors hurried him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) on, through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison.
<p/>Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) was searched, that he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) might not have about him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) the means of anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) to one of the condemned cells, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) there--alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat and bedstead; and casting his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to collect his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/>After awhile, he (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), at the time, that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) could not hear a word.
<p/>These gradually fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more: so that in a little time he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had the whole, almost as it was delivered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) gazed stupidly about him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) for an instant, and obeyed. To be hanged by the neck, till he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was dead--that was the end.
<p/>As it came on very dark, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) began to think of all the men he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had known who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) means.
<p/>To be hanged by the neck till he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was dead. They rose up, in such quick succession, that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) could hardly count them.
<p/>With what a rattling noise the drop went down; and how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had seen some of them die,--and had joked too, because they died with prayers upon their lips. Some of them might have inhabited that very cell--sat upon that very spot.
<p/>It was very dark; why didn't they bring a light? The cell had been built for many years. Scores of men must have passed their last hours there.
<p/>It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies--the cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) knew, even beneath that hideous veil.--Light, light!
<p/>one bearing a candle, which he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall: the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more.
<p/>At length, when his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls, two men appeared: Then came the night--dark, dismal, silent night.
<p/>Other watchers are glad to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming day. To him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) they brought despair.
<p/>The boom of every iron bell came laden with the one, deep, hollow sound--Death. What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)?
<p/>There was no day; it was gone as soon as come--and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours.
<p/>It was another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning. The day passed off. Day? At one time he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) raved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hair.
<p/>Venerable men of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own persuasion had come to pray beside him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had driven them away with curses. They renewed their charitable efforts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) beat them off.
<p/>It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) blighted soul; not that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had spoken little to either of the two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>); and they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) attention.
<p/>Saturday night. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had only one night more to live. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) thought of this, the day broke--Sunday. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had sat there, awake, but dreaming.
<p/>Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) started up, every minute, and with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they--used to such sights--recoiled from him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) with horror.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) grew so terrible, at last, in all the tortures of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) evil conscience, that one man could not bear to sit there, eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) alone; and so the two kept watch together.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) capture, and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) head was bandaged with a linen cloth.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) red hair hung down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) bloodless face; his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) beard was torn, and twisted into knots; his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) eyes shone with a terrible light; his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) up.
<p/>If it was not a trick to frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and those were the real hours treading on each other's heels, where would he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) be, when they came round again!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) cowered down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) stone bed, and thought of the past. Eight--nine--then. Eleven! Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate.
<p/>Those dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as that.
<p/>The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged to-morrow, would have slept but ill that night, if they could have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>From early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received.
<p/>These being answered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built, and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the scene.
<p/>By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness.
<p/>The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers, painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner, signed by one of the sheriffs.
<p/>At eight, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would be the only mourner in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own funeral train; at eleven-- They were immediately admitted into the lodge. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the mourner</b></font>)</div>said the man whose duty it was to conduct them. <div class="bookquote">` It's not a sight for children, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is not indeed, my friend,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Brownlow; <div class="bookquote">`but my business with this man is intimately connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>); and as this child has seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) in the full career of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) success and villainy, I think it as well--even at the cost of some pain and fear--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) should see him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) now.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>The man touched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity, opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence--`this is the place he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passes through.
<p/>These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver. If you step this way, you can see the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) goes out at.'
<p/>There was an open grating above it, through which came the sound of men's voices, mingled with the noise of hammering, and the throwing down of boards.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food, and pointed to a door. They were putting up the scaffold.
<p/>From this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard, ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand.
<p/>The two attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage, stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell.
<p/>Motioning them to remain where they were, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his (<font color='blue'><b>jailer</b></font>) bunch of keys. They did so.
<p/>The condemned criminal was seated on his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) bed, rocking himself from side to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind was evidently wandering to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old life, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vision. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Good boy, Charley--well done--'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) mumbled. <div class="bookquote">` Oliver, too, ha! ha! ha! Oliver too--quite the gentleman now--quite the--take that boy away to bed!'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) not to be alarmed, looked on without speaking. <div class="bookquote">` Take him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) away to bed!'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Fagin. <div class="bookquote">` Do you hear me, some of you? He (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) has been the--the-- somehow the cause of all this. It's worth the money to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) up to it--
<p/>Bolter's throat, Bill; never mind the girl--Bolter's throat as deep as you can cut. Saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) head off!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Fagin,'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div>said the jailer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>An old man, my Lord; a very old, old man!'  (<font color='red'><b>the jailer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Here,'  (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div>said the turnkey, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That's me!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of listening he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had assumed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) trial. <div class="bookquote">` Here's somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I suppose.
<p/>I shan't be one long,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) replied, looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Fagin, Fagin! Are you a man?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Strike them all dead! What right have they to butcher me?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow.
<p/>Shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) demanded to know what they wanted there. <div class="bookquote">` Steady,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the turnkey, still holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) down. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, sir, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) what you want. Quick , if you please, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) grows worse as the time gets on.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You have some papers,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brownlow advancing, <div class="bookquote">`which were placed in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>For the love of God,' said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, `do not say that now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` It's all a lie together,'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>replied Fagin. <div class="bookquote">` I haven't one--not one.'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of any further gain.
<p/>Where are those papers?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oliver,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin, beckoning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Here, here! Let me whisper to you.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I am not afraid,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>said Oliver in a low voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) relinquished Mr. Brownlow's hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The papers,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div>said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`are in a canvas bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room.
<p/>I want to talk to you, my dear. I want to talk to you.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div>returned Oliver. <div class="bookquote">` Let me say a prayer.
<p/>Do! Let me say one prayer. Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till morning.'  (<font color='red'><b>Oliver/Oliver Twist/OLIVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Outside, outside,'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR.

<p/>You can get me out, if you take me so. Now then, now then!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh! God forgive this wretched man!'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cried the boy with a burst of tears. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That's right , that's right,'  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said Fagin. <div class="bookquote">` That'll help us on. This door first. If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don't you mind, but hurry on.
<p/>Now, now, now!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Have you nothing else to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div>inquired the turnkey. <div class="bookquote">` No other question,'  (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Brownlow. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If I hoped we could recall him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) to a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) position--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow/MR. BROWNLOW/Brownlow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Nothing will do that, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the man, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You had better leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned. <div class="bookquote">` Press on, press on,'  (<font color='red'><b>the attendants</b></font>)</div>cried Fagin. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Softly, but not so slow. Faster, faster!'  (<font color='red'><b>Fagin/Mr. Fagin/MR. FAGIN</b></font>)</div>The men laid hands upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>), and disengaging Oliver from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) grasp, held him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) struggled with the power of desperation, for an instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard.
<p/>Oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had not the strength to walk.
<p/>A great multitude had already assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing cards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking.
<p/>Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of all--the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and all the hideous apparatus of death.
<p/>It was some time before they left the prison. Day was dawning when they again emerged. CHAPTER LIII AND LAST The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed.
<p/>Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman's labours; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home.
<p/>Mrs. Maylie took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) abode with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) son and daughter-in-law, to enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maylie</b></font>) days, the greatest felicity that age and worth can know--the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent life, have been unceasingly bestowed.
<p/>It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of Monks -LRB-which had never prospered either in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hands or in those of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother-RRB- were equally divided between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than three thousand pounds.
<p/>By the provisions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) father's will, Oliver would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) former vices and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) young charge joyfully acceded.
<p/>Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) portion to a distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) once more fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) old courses, and, after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk under an attack of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) old disorder, and died in prison.
<p/>The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few and simple words. As far from home, died the chief remaining members of his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) friend Fagin's gang.
<p/>Removing with him (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) dear friends resided, he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver's warm and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world.
<p/>Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) old friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would have been discontented if his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had known how.
<p/>For two or three months, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) contented himself with hinting that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) feared the air began to disagree with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); then, finding that the place really no longer was, to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), what it had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) settled his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) business on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) assistant, took a bachelor's cottage outside the village of which his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered.
<p/>Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) son. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) took to gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits of a similar kind:
<p/>all undertaken with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) characteristic impetuosity. In each and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) has since become famous throughout the neighborhood, as a most profound authority.
<p/>Before his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) removal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had managed to contract a strong friendship for Mr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course of the year.
<p/>On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) favourite asseveration, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) mode is the right one.
<p/>On Sundays, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman's face: always informing Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Losberne</b></font>) considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say so.
<p/>It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to rally him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) of the night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) return; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimwig</b></font>) was right in the main, and, in proof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth a laugh on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) side, and increases his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) good humour.
<p/>Mr. Noah Claypole: receiving a free pardon from the Crown in consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin: and considering his (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) profession not altogether as safe a one as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) could wish: was, for some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened with too much work.
<p/>After some consideration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) went into business as an informer, in which calling he (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) realises a genteel subsistence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fagin</b></font>) plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by Charlotte in respectable attire.
<p/>The lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with three-penny worth of brandy to restore her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), lays an information next day, and pockets half the penalty.
<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others.
<p/>Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bumble</b></font>) wife.
<p/>As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts, although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey.
<p/>They sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong.
<p/>Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes's crime, fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best.
<p/>Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) back upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer's drudge, and a carrier's lad, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is now the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire.
<p/>And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space, the thread of these adventures.
<p/>I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it.
<p/>I would show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood, shedding on her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell on all who trod it with her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), and shone into their hearts.
<p/>I would paint her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively summer group; I would follow her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) through the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low tones of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) in all her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) dead sister's child happy in their love for one another, and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little faces that clustered round her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) knee, and listen to their merry prattle; I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye.
<p/>Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints himself, but the result is the same. These, and a thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech
<p/>How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), more and more, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) nature developed itself, and showed the thriving seeds of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) to become--how he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) traced in him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) new traits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) early friend, that awakened in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) own bosom old remembrances, melancholy and yet sweet and soothing--how the two orphans, tried by adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent thanks to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) who had protected and preserved them
<p/>--I would fain recall them every one. --these are all matters which need not to be told. I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude to that
<p/>Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be attained.
<p/>Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet, which bears as yet but one word: <div class="bookquote">`AGNES.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There is no coffin in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is placed above it!
<p/>But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love--the love beyond the grave--of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook.
