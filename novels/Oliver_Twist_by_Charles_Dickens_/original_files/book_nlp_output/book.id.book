The more he thought of the Jew 's admonition , the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning . He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes , which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin ; and after meditating for a long time , concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker , until another boy , better suited for his purpose could be engaged . He was too well accustomed to suffering , and had suffered too much where he was , to bewail the prospect of change very severely . He remained lost in thought for some minutes ; and then , with a heavy sigh , snuffed the candle , and , taking up the book which the Jew had left with him , began to read .

Thus attired , he gave his hand to the robber , who , merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat , clasped it firmly in his , and , exchanging a farewell with Nancy , led him away .

Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words , she checked her lamentations as though by one effort ; and drawing herself up as she spoke , became composed and firm . He was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted ; and that , under all the care and watching which ensued , Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and collected : performing all the duties which had devolved upon her , steadily , and , to all external appearances , even cheerfully .

He war n't one of the family , at that time ; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag , that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night , by a tall man with a black patch over his eye , who had concealed himself under the bed , and after committing the robbery , jumped slap out of window : which was only a story high . Always interrupting , you are , partner ! He was wery quick about it . But Conkey was quick , too ; for he fired a blunderbuss arter him , and roused the neighbourhood . They set up a hue-and-cry , directly , and when they came to look about 'em , found that Conkey had hit the robber ; for there was traces of blood , all the way to some palings a good distance off ; and there they lost 'em . However , he had made off with the blunt ; and , consequently , the name of Mr. Chickweed , licensed witler , appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts ; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions , and I do n't know what all , was got up for the poor man , who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss , and went up and down the streets , for three or four days , a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself . One day he came up to the office , all in a hurry , and had a private interview with the magistrate , who , after a deal of talk , rings the bell , and orders Jem Spyers in -LRB- Jem was a active officer -RRB- , and tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house . '' I see him , Spyers , '' said Chickweed , `` pass my house yesterday morning , '' `` Why did n't you up , and collar him ! '' says Spyers . I was so struck all of a heap , that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick , '' says the poor man ; Spyers no sooner heard this , than he put some clean linen and a comb , in his pocket , in case he should have to stop a day or two ; and away he goes , and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain , with his hat on , all ready to bolt out , at a moment 's notice . '' `` but we 're sure to have him ; for between ten and eleven o'clock at night he passed again . '' He was smoking his pipe here , late at night , when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out , `` Here he is ! Away goes Spyers ; on goes Chickweed ; round turns the people ; everybody roars out , `` Thieves ! '' and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting , all the time , like mad . Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner ; shoots round ; sees a little crowd ; dives in ; `` Which is the man ? '' Stop thief ! Murder ! '' Jem Spyers dashes out ; and there he sees Chickweed , a-tearing down the street full cry . `` D -- me ! '' says Chickweed , `` I 've lost him again ! Next morning , Spyers took his old place , and looked out , from behind the curtain , for a tall man with a black patch over his eye , till his own two eyes ached again . At last , he could n't help shutting 'em , to ease 'em a minute ; and the very moment he did so , he hears Chickweed a-roaring out , `` Here he is ! '' Off he starts once more , with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him ; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday 's one , the man 's lost again ! This was done , once or twice more , till one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil , who was playing tricks with him arterwards ; and the other half , that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief .

To reach this place , the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close , narrow , and muddy streets , thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people , and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion . The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops ; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman 's door , and stream from the house-parapet and windows . Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class , ballast-heavers , coal-whippers , brazen women , ragged children , and the raff and refuse of the river , he makes his way with difficulty along , assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left , and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner . Arriving , at length , in streets remoter and less-frequented than those through which he has passed , he walks beneath tottering house-fronts projecting over the pavement , dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes , chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall , windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away , every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect . In such a neighborhood , beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark , stands Jacob 's Island , surrounded by a muddy ditch , six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in , once called Mill Pond , but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch . It is a creek or inlet from the Thames , and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name . At such times , a stranger , looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane , will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows , buckets , pails , domestic utensils of all kinds , in which to haul the water up ; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves , his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him . Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses , with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath ; windows , broken and patched , with poles thrust out , on which to dry the linen that is never there ; rooms so small , so filthy , so confined , that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter ; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud , and threatening to fall into it -- as some have done ; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying foundations ; every repulsive lineament of poverty , every loathsome indication of filth , rot , and garbage ; all these ornament the banks of Folly Ditch . In Jacob 's Island , the warehouses are roofless and empty ; the walls are crumbling down ; the windows are windows no more ; the doors are falling into the streets ; the chimneys are blackened , but they yield no smoke . Thirty or forty years ago , before losses and chancery suits came upon it , it was a thriving place ; but now it is a desolate island indeed . The houses have no owners ; they are broken open , and entered upon by those who have the courage ; and there they live , and there they die . They must have powerful motives for a secret residence , or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed , who seek a refuge in Jacob 's Island . In an upper room of one of these houses -- a detached house of fair size , ruinous in other respects , but strongly defended at door and window : of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described -- there were assembled three men , who , regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation , sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence . One of these was Toby Crackit , another Mr. Chitling , and the third a robber of fifty years , whose nose had been almost beaten in , in some old scuffle , and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion .
