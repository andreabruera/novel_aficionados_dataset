<p/>When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) uncle everybody said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>XXVII IN THE GARDEN THE SECRET GARDEN BY FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT CHAPTER I THERE IS NO ONE LEFT It was true, too.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) hair was yellow, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) face was yellow because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) over to the care of an Ayah, who was made to understand that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wished to please the Mem Sahib she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must keep the child out of sight as much as possible.
<p/>So when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was kept out of the way, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was kept out of the way also.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was disturbed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) crying, by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was six years old
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression. she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived.
<p/>The young English governess who came to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to read and write disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) place in three months, and when other governesses came to try to fill it
<p/>So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would never have learned her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) letters at all.
<p/>One frightfully hot morning, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was about nine years old, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) awakened feeling very cross, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) became crosser still when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw that the servant who stood by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bedside was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah.
<p/>they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. '' Why did you come? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to the strange woman.
<p/>The woman looked frightened, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only stammered that the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.
<p/>'' I will not let you stay. Send my Ayah to me. '' There was something mysterious in the air that morning.
<p/>Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pretended that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was making a flower-bed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would say and the names she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would call Saidie when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) returned.
<p/>But no one would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) anything and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah did not come. '' Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was grinding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) teeth and saying this over and over again when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother come out on the veranda with some one.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices. Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a very young officer who had just come from England. The child stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stared most at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) always did this when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a chance to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), because the Mem Sahib--Mary used to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that oftener than anything else--was such a tall, slim, pretty person and wore such lovely clothes.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hair was like curly silk and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had large laughing eyes.
<p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) clothes were thin and floating, and Mary said they were <div class="bookquote">``full of lace. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>They looked fuller of lace than ever this morning, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes were not laughing at all.
<p/>They were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer's face. '' Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?
<p/>'' Mary heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) say. '' Awfully,'' the young man answered in a trembling voice. '' Awfully, Mrs. Lennox. You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.
<p/>'' The Mem Sahib wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) hands. '' Oh, I know I ought! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) cried. '' I only stayed to go to that silly dinner party.
<p/>At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the servants' quarters that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) clutched the young man's arm, and Mary stood shivering from head to foot.
<p/>What a fool I was! '' The wailing grew wilder and wilder. '' What is it? What is it? '' Mrs. Lennox gasped.
<p/>'' Some one has died,'' answered the boy officer. '' You did not say it had broken out among your servants.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I did not know! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mem Sahib</b></font>)</div>the Mem Sahib cried. <div class="bookquote">``Come with me! Come with me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) turned and ran into the house.
<p/>After that, appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to Mary. The cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies.
<p/>The Ayah had been taken ill in the night, and it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts.
<p/>Before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror. There was panic on every side, and dying people in all the bungalows.
<p/>During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone. Nobody thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), nobody wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and strange things happened of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew nothing.
<p/>Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) only knew that people were ill and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard mysterious and frightening sounds.
<p/>Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason.
<p/>The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled. It was sweet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know how strong it was.
<p/>Very soon it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) intensely drowsy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nursery and shut herself in again, frightened by cries she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet.
<p/>The wine made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) so sleepy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could scarcely keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes open and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lay down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bed and knew nothing more for a long time.
<p/>Many things happened during the hours in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) slept so heavily, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) awakened she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lay and stared at the wall. The house was perfectly still. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never known it to be so silent before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered also who would take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) now her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah was dead. There would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would know some new stories.
<p/>Mary had been rather tired of the old ones. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not cry because her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nurse had died. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for any one.
<p/>The noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was alive.
<p/>Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves.
<p/>But if everyone had got well again, surely some one would remember and come to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). But no one came, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heard something rustling on the matting and when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked down she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw a little snake gliding along and watching her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with eyes like jewels.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not frightened, because he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed in a hurry to get out of the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slipped under the door as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). '' How queer and quiet it is,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. '' It sounds as if there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake.
<p/>'' Almost the next minute she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heard footsteps in the compound, and then on the veranda. They were men's footsteps, and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices.
<p/>No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms. '' What desolation!
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heard one voice say. '' That pretty, pretty woman! I suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no one ever saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected.
<p/>'' Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later. The first man who came in was a large officer she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had once seen talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked tired and troubled, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was so startled that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) almost jumped back. <div class="bookquote">``Barney!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) cried out.
<p/>'' There is a child here! A child alone! In a place like this! Mercy on us, who is she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)!'' <div class="bookquote">``I am Mary Lennox,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) thought the man was very rude to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) father's bungalow <div class="bookquote">``A place like this!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and I have only just wakened up.
<p/>Why does nobody come?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is the child no one ever saw! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the man, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companions. ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) has actually been forgotten!'' <div class="bookquote">``Why was I forgotten? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary said, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) foot. '' Why does nobody come? ''
<p/>The young man whose name was Barney looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very sadly. Mary even thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) wink his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) eyes as if to wink tears away.
<p/>It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had neither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried away in the night, and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of them even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib.
<p/>'' Poor little kid! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) said. '' There is nobody left to come. '' That was why the place was so quiet.
<p/>CHAPTER II MISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY Mary had liked to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother from a distance and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very pretty,
<p/>but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew very little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could scarcely have been expected to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) or to miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very much when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was gone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at all, in fact, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a self-absorbed child she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) entire thought to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had always done.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been older she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the world, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was very young, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had always been taken care of, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) always would be.
<p/>What she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would like to know if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was going to nice people, who would be polite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own way as her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah and the other native servants had done.
<p/>It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not going to stay at the English clergyman's house where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was taken at first.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not want to stay. The English clergyman was poor and he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had five children nearly all the same age
<p/>Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>and they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toys from each other. By the second day they had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a nickname which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) furious.
<p/>It was Basil who thought of it first. Basil was a little boy with impudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was playing by herself under a tree, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been playing the day the cholera broke out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was making heaps of earth and paths for a garden and Basil came and stood near to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) got rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion. '' Why don't you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) said. '' There in the middle,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) leaned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to point. <div class="bookquote">``Go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>cried Mary. '' I don't want boys.
<p/>Go away! '' For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) began to tease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) was always teasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) sisters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) danced round and round her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and made faces and sang and laughed. '' Mistress Mary, quite contrary, How does your garden grow?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and the crosser Mary got, the more they sang <div class="bookquote">``Mistress Mary, quite contrary'' (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>; and after that as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stayed with them they called her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Mistress Mary Quite Contrary''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>when they spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to each other, and often when they spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>With silver bells, and cockle shells, And marigolds all in a row. '' '' You are going to be sent home,'' Basil said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``at the end of the week.
<p/>And we're glad of it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of it, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary. '' Where is home?'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) doesn't know where home is!'' said Basil, with seven-year-old scorn.
<p/>'' It's England, of course. Our grandmama lives there and our sister Mabel was sent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) last year. You are not going to your grandmama.
<p/>You have none. You are going to your uncle. His (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) name is Mr. Archibald Craven. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>snapped Mary.
<p/>'' I know you don't,'' Basil answered. '' You don't know anything. Girls never do. I heard father and mother talking about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lives in a great, big, desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s so cross he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) won't let them, and they wouldn't come if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would let them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) back and stuck her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fingers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ears, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not listen any more.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Crawford told her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) that night that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was going to sail away to England in a few days and go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived at Misselthwaite Manor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested that they did not know what to think about her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>).
<p/>They tried to be kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) only turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) face away when Mrs. Crawford attempted to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and held herself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)'s a hunchback, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)'s horrid. '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is such a plain child,'' Mrs. Crawford said pityingly, afterward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps if her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother had carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pretty face and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pretty manners oftener into the nursery Mary might have learned some pretty ways too.

<p/>Mary made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer's wife, who was taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) children to leave them in a boarding-school.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was very much absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own little boy and girl, and was rather glad to hand the child over to the woman
<p/>Think of the servants running away and leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) all alone in that deserted bungalow. '' Mr. Archibald Craven sent to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in London.
<p/>The woman was his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor, and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) name was Mrs. Medlock. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was a stout woman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) wore a very purple dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) head.
<p/>Mary did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at all, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very seldom liked people there was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was very evident Mrs. Medlock did not think much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/>'' My word! she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'s a plain little piece of goods! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said. '' And we'd heard that her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) mother was a beauty.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) hasn't handed much of it down, has she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), ma'am?'' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) will improve as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) grows older,''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>the officer's wife said good-naturedly.
<p/>'' If she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) were not so sallow and had a nicer expression, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) features are rather good. Children alter so much.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll have to alter a good deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Medlock. '' And, there's nothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite--if you ask me!
<p/>They thought Mary was not listening because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was standing a little apart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was watching the passing buses and cabs and people, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard quite well and was made very curious about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) uncle and the place he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) lived in.
<p/>'' What sort of a place was it, and what would he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) be like? What was a hunchback? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never seen one.
<p/>Since she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been living in other people's houses and had had no Ayah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had begun to wonder why she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never seemed to belong to anyone even when her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father and mother had been alive.
<p/>Other children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never seemed to really be anyone's little girl.
<p/>Perhaps there were none in India. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had had servants, and food and clothes, but no one had taken any notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know that this was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was disagreeable.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had ever seen, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) common, highly colored face and her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) common fine bonnet.
<p/>When the next day they set out on their journey to Yorkshire, she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) walked through the station to the railway carriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) head up and trying to keep as far away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did not want to seem to belong to her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) often thought that other people were, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was so herself. It would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) angry to think people imagined she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) little girl.
<p/>But Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was the kind of woman who would <div class="bookquote">``stand no nonsense from young ones.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had not wanted to go to London just when her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) sister Maria's daughter was going to be married, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had a comfortable, well paid place as housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could keep it was to do at once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) to do.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>At least, that is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) would have said if she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had been asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) never dared even to ask a question.
<p/>'' Captain Lennox and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wife died of the cholera,'' Mr. Craven had said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) short, cold way. '' Captain Lennox was my wife's brother and I am their daughter's guardian.
<p/>The child is to be brought here. You must go to London and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) yourself. '' So she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) packed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) small trunk and made the journey.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) had nothing to read or to look at, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) had folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) thin little black-gloved hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) lap.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) black dress made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) look yellower than ever, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) limp light hair straggled from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) black crepe hat.
<p/>Mary sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) corner of the railway carriage and looked plain and fretful. '' A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,'' Mrs. Medlock thought.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything; and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) got tired of watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) and began to talk in a brisk, hard voice.
<p/>-LRB-Marred is a Yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish.-RRB- '' I suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are going to,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Do you know anything about your uncle?'' '' No,'' said Mary. '' Never heard your father and mother talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''
<p/>'' No,'' said Mary frowning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) frowned because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remembered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father and mother had never talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) about anything in particular.
<p/>Certainly they had never told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) things. '' Humph,'' muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) queer, unresponsive little face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did not say any more for a few moments
<p/>and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) began again. '' I suppose you might as well be told something--to prepare you. You are going to a queer place.
<p/>Mary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather discomfited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) apparent indifference, but, after taking a breath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) went on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not but that it's a grand big place in a gloomy way, and Mr. Craven's proud of it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) way--and that's gloomy enough, too.
<p/>The house is six hundred years old and it's on the edge of the moor, and there's near a hundred rooms in it, though most of them's shut up and locked.
<p/>And there's pictures and fine old furniture and things that's been there for ages, and there's a big park round it and gardens and trees with branches trailing to the ground--some of them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) paused and took another breath. '' But there's nothing else,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ended suddenly. Mary had begun to listen in spite of herself.
<p/>It all sounded so unlike India, and anything new rather attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not intend to look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were interested.
<p/>That was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) unhappy, disagreeable ways. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat still. '' Well,'' said Mrs. Medlock. '' What do you think of it?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) answered. '' I know nothing about such places. '' That made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh.
<p/>'' Eh!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but you are like an old woman. Don't you care?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``whether I care or not.

'' It doesn't. What you're to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor for I don't know, unless because it's the easiest way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s not going to trouble himself about you, that's sure and certain. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) never troubles himself about no one. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) stopped herself as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had just remembered something in time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was a sour young man and got no good of all his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) money and big place till he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was married.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s got a crooked back,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said. '' That set him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wrong. '' Mary's eyes turned toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) intention not to seem to care.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never thought of the hunchback's being married and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a trifle surprised. Mrs. Medlock saw this, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was a talkative woman she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) continued with more interest.
<p/>This was one way of passing some of the time, at any rate. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was a sweet, pretty thing and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'d have walked the world over to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) a blade o' grass she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) wanted.
<p/>Nobody thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'d marry him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did, and people said she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) married him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) money. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) didn't-- she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) didn't,'' positively.
<p/>'' When she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) died--'' Mary gave a little involuntary jump. '' Oh! did she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) die! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) exclaimed, quite without meaning to.
<p/>It had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess and it had made her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had just remembered a French fairy story she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had once read called <div class="bookquote">``Riquet a la Houppe. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) died,'' Mrs. Medlock answered.
<p/>Most of the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) goes away, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) is at Misselthwaite he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) shuts himself up in the West Wing and won't let any one but
<p/>'' And it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) queerer than ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) cares about nobody. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) won't see people. Pitcher see him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>). Pitcher's an old fellow, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) took care of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was a child and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knows his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ways.
<p/>A house with a hundred rooms, nearly all shut up and with their doors locked--a house on the edge of a moor--whatsoever a moor was--sounded dreary.
<p/>'' It sounded like something in a book and it did not make Mary feel cheerful. A man with a crooked back who shut himself up also!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stared out of the window with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lips pinched together, and it seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in gray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window-panes.
<p/>If the pretty wife had been alive she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might have made things cheerful by being something like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own mother and by running in and out and going to parties as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done in frocks <div class="bookquote">``full of lace.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not there any more. '' You needn't expect to see him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), because ten to one you won't,'' said Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>'' And you mustn't expect that there will be people to talk to you. You'll have to play about and look after yourself.
<p/>You'll be told what rooms you can go into and what rooms you're to keep out of. There's gardens enough. But when you're in the house don't go wandering and poking about.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not want to go poking about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said sour little Mary and just as suddenly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had begun to be rather sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to cease to be sorry and to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was unpleasant enough to deserve all that had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face toward the streaming panes of the window of the railway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as if it would go on forever and ever.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) watched it so long and steadily that the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fell asleep.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) slept a long time, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) awakened Mrs. Medlock had bought a lunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold beef and bread and butter and some hot tea.
<p/>The rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening waterproofs.
<p/>The guard lighted the lamps in the carriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very much over her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) tea and chicken and beef.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself, and Mary sat and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fine bonnet slip on one side until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage, lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows.
<p/>Mr. Craven won't have it. '' CHAPTER III ACROSS THE MOOR It was quite dark when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) awakened again. The train had stopped at a station and Mrs. Medlock was shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/>'' You have had a sleep! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said. '' It's time to open your eyes! We're at Thwaite Station and we've got a long drive before us.
<p/>The little girl did not offer to help her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), because in India native servants always picked up or carried things and it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one.
<p/>'' Mary stood up and tried to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes open while Mrs. Medlock collected her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) parcels. The station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out of the train.
<p/>The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a rough, good-natured way, pronouncing his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) words in a queer broad fashion which Mary found out afterward was Yorkshire.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that's her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a Yorkshire accent herself and jerking her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) head over her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) shoulder toward Mary.
<p/>'' I see tha's got back,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. '' An' tha's browt th' young `un with thee.'' '' How's thy Missus?''
<p/>'' Well enow. Th' carriage is waitin' outside for thee. '' A brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was, the burly station-master included.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they drove off, the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned corner, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not inclined to go to sleep again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat and looked out of the window, curious to see something of the road over which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was being driven to the queer place Mrs. Medlock had spoken of.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was not at all a timid child and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was not exactly frightened, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) felt that there was no knowing what might happen in a house with a hundred rooms nearly all
<p/>Mary saw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in. shut up--a house standing on the edge of a moor.
<p/>'' What is a moor? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock. '' Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you'll see,'' the woman answered.
<p/>'' We've got to drive five miles across Missel Moor before we get to the Manor. You won't see much because it's a dark night, but you can see something.
<p/>The carriage lamps cast rays of light a little distance ahead of them and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) caught glimpses of the things they passed.
<p/>After they had left the station they had driven through a tiny village and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public house.
<p/>Then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little shop-window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things set out for sale.
<p/>'' Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) corner, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes on the window. Then they were on the highroad
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw hedges and trees. After that there seemed nothing different for a long time--or at least it seemed a long time to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing up-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) leaned forward and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt.
<p/>The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh! We're on the moor now sure enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Medlock. A wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.
<p/>'' It's--it's not the sea, is it?'' said Mary, looking round at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) companion. '' No, not it,'' answered Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>Nor it isn't fields nor mountains, it's just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' It sounds like the sea just now.
<p/>'' '' That's the wind blowing through the bushes,'' Mrs. Medlock said. '' It's a wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there's plenty that likes it--particularly when the heather's in bloom.
<p/>On and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped, the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds.
<p/>The road went up and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise.
<p/>Mary felt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide, bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was passing on a strip of dry land.
<p/>'' '' I don't like it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to herself. '' I don't like it,'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pinched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thin lips more tightly together.
<p/>The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) first caught sight of a light. Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did and drew a long sigh of relief.
<p/>'' Eh, I am glad to see that bit o' light twinkling,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) exclaimed. '' It's the light in the lodge window.
<p/>It was <div class="bookquote">``after a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said, for when the carriage passed through the park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and
<p/>We shall get a good cup of tea after a bit, at all events. '' the trees -LRB-which nearly met overhead-RRB- made it seem as if they were driving through a long dark vault.
<p/>They drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an immensely long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stone court.
<p/>At first Mary thought that there were no lights at all in the windows, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got out of the carriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw that one room in a corner upstairs showed a dull glow.
<p/>The entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shaped panels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron bars.
<p/>It opened into an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of armor made Mary feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not want to look at them.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood on the stone floor she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked a very small, odd little black figure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as small and lost and odd as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked.
<p/>A neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for them. '' You are to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said in a husky voice.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s going to London in the morning. '' <div class="bookquote">``Very well, Mr. Pitcher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Medlock answered.
<p/>What's expected of you, Mrs. Medlock,'' Mr. Pitcher said, <div class="bookquote">``is that you make sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>)'s not disturbed and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) doesn't see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) doesn't want to see.
<p/>And then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase and down a long corridor and up a short flight of steps and through another corridor and another, until a door opened in a wall
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pitcher</b></font>)</div>So long as I know what's expected of me, I can manage. '' '' '' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) found herself in a room with a fire in it and a supper on a table.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock said unceremoniously: <div class="bookquote">``Well, here you are! This room and the next are where you'll live--and you must keep to them.
<p/>It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaid had come into her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) room to light the fire and was kneeling on the hearth-rug raking out the cinders noisily.
<p/>Don't you forget that! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER IV MARTHA Mary lay and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) for a few moments and then began to look about the room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy. The walls were covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it.
<p/>There were fantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle.
<p/>Out of a deep window she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an endless, dull, purplish sea.
<p/>There were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies. Mary felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were in the forest with them. ''
<p/>What is that?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, pointing out of the window. Martha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) feet, looked and pointed also.
<p/>'' That there? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. '' Yes.'' '' That's th' moor,'' with a good-natured grin. '' Does tha' like it?''
<p/>'' No,'' answered Mary. '' I hate it.'' '' That's because tha`rt not used to it,'' Martha said, going back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hearth.
<p/>'' Tha' thinks it's too big an' bare now. But tha' will like it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>inquired Mary. '' Aye, that I do,'' answered Martha, cheerfully polishing away at the grate.
<p/>'' I just love it. It's none bare. It's covered wi' growin' things as smells sweet. It's fair lovely in spring an' summer when th' gorse an' broom an' heather's in flower.
<p/>It smells o' honey an' there's such a lot o' fresh air--an' th' sky looks so high an' th' bees an' skylarks makes such a nice noise hummin' an' singin'.
<p/>Eh! I wouldn't live away from th' moor for anythin'. '' Mary listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with a grave, puzzled expression. The native servants she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been used to in India were not in the least like this.
<p/>They were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their masters as if they were their equals. They made salaams and called them <div class="bookquote">``protector of the poor''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and names of that sort.
<p/>It was not the custom to say <div class="bookquote">``please''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``thank you''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>and Mary had always slapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah in the face when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was angry.
<p/>Indian servants were commanded to do things, not asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered a little what this girl would do if one slapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in the face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a round, rosy, good-natured-looking creature, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a sturdy way which made Mistress Mary wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might not even slap back--if the person who slapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was only a little girl.
<p/>Martha sat up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) heels, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) blacking-brush in her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hand, and laughed, without seeming the least out of temper.
<p/>'' You are a strange servant,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said from her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) pillows, rather haughtily. '' Eh! I know that,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. ''
<p/>If there was a grand Missus at Misselthwaite I should never have been even one of th' under house-maids. I might have been let to be scullerymaid
<p/>but I'd never have been let upstairs. I'm too common an' I talk too much Yorkshire. But this is a funny house for all
<p/>it's so grand. Seems like there's neither Master nor Mistress except Mr. Pitcher an' Mrs. Medlock. Mr. Craven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) won't be troubled about anythin' when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s here, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s nearly always away.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock gave me th' place out o' kindness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could never have done it if Misselthwaite had been like other big houses.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to be my servant?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary asked, still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) imperious little Indian way. Martha began to rub her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) grate again.
<p/>'' I'm Mrs. Medlock's servant,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said stoutly. '' An' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'s Mr. Craven's--but I'm to do the housemaid's work up here
<p/>an' wait on you a bit. But you won't need much waitin' on.'' <div class="bookquote">``Who is going to dress me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>demanded Mary.
<p/>Martha sat up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) heels again and stared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke in broad Yorkshire in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) amazement. '' Canna' tha' dress thysen!
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' What do you mean? I don't understand your language,'' said Mary. '' Eh! I forgot,'' Martha said.
<p/>'' Mrs. Medlock told me I'd have to be careful or you wouldn't know what I was sayin'. I mean can't you put on your own clothes?''
<p/>'' No,'' answered Mary, quite indignantly. '' I never did in my life. My Ayah dressed me, of course.'' '' Well,'' said Martha, evidently not in the least aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was impudent, <div class="bookquote">``it's time tha' should learn.
<p/>My mother always said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) couldn't see why grand people's children didn't turn out fair fools--what with nurses an' bein' washed an' dressed an' took out to walk as if they was puppies!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Tha' cannot begin younger. It'll do thee good to wait on thysen a bit. <div class="bookquote">``It is different in India,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div>said Mistress Mary disdainfully.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could scarcely stand this. But Martha was not at all crushed. '' Eh! I can see it's different,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) answered almost sympathetically.
<p/>'' I dare say it's because there's such a lot o' blacks there instead o' respectable white people. When I heard you was comin' from India
<p/>I thought you was a black too. '' Mary sat up in bed furious. <div class="bookquote">``What! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What! You thought I was a native.
<p/>You--you daughter of a pig!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>Martha stared and looked hot. '' Who are you callin' names? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. '' You needn't be so vexed.
<p/>That's not th' way for a young lady to talk. I've nothin' against th' blacks. When you read about 'em in tracts they're always very religious.
<p/>You always read as a black's a man an' a brother. I've never seen a black an ' I was fair pleased to think I was goin' to see one close.
<p/>When I come in to light your fire this mornin' I crep' up to your bed an' pulled th' cover back careful to look at you.
<p/>An' there you was,'' disappointedly, <div class="bookquote">``no more black than me--for all you're so yeller. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary did not even try to control her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) rage and humiliation.
<p/>'' You thought I was a native! You dared! You don't know anything about natives! They are not people-- they're servants who must salaam to you.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl's simple stare, and somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suddenly felt so horribly lonely and far away from everything she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) understood and which understood her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) threw herself face downward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing.
<p/>You know nothing about India. You know nothing about anything! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sobbed so unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire Martha was a little frightened and quite sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) went to the bed and bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>). '' Eh! you mustn't cry like that there! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) begged. ''
<p/>You mustn't for sure. I didn't know you'd be vexed. I don't know anythin' about anythin'--just like you said. I beg your pardon,
<p/>There was something comforting and really friendly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) queer Yorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect on Mary.
<p/>Miss.. Do stop cryin'. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gradually ceased crying and became quiet. Martha looked relieved. '' It's time for thee to get up now,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Mrs. Medlock said I was to carry tha' breakfast an' tea an' dinner into th' room next to this. It's been made into a nursery for thee.
<p/>I'll help thee on with thy clothes if tha'll get out o' bed. If th' buttons are at th' back tha' cannot button them up tha`self.
<p/>When Mary at last decided to get up, the clothes Martha took from the wardrobe were not the ones she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had worn when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) arrived the night before with Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>'' '' Those are not mine,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said. '' Mine are black. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) looked the thick white wool coat and dress over, and added with cool approval: <div class="bookquote">``Those are nicer than mine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>'' These are th' ones tha' must put on,'' Martha answered. '' Mr. Craven ordered Mrs. Medlock to get 'em in London.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said 'I won't have a child dressed in black wanderin' about like a lost soul,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said. ' It'd make the place sadder than it is.
<p/>Put color on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).' Mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) meant. Mother always knows what a body means. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) doesn't hold with black hersel'.
<p/>Martha had <div class="bookquote">``buttoned up''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) little sisters and brothers but she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had never seen a child who stood still and waited for another person to do things for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had neither hands nor feet of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) own.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I hate black things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. The dressing process was one which taught them both something. '' Why doesn't tha' put on tha' own shoes?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said when Mary quietly held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) foot. '' My Ayah did it,'' answered Mary, staring. '' It was the custom.
<p/>If one told them to do a thing their ancestors had not done for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said, <div class="bookquote">``It is not the custom''  (<font color='red'><b>ancestors</b></font>)</div>and one knew that was the end of the matter.
<p/>It had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should do anything but stand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was ready for breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to suspect that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life at Misselthwaite Manor would end by teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a number of things quite new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)--things such as putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own shoes and stockings, and picking up things she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) let fall.
<p/>If Martha had been a well-trained fine young lady's maid she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) would have been more subservient and respectful and would have known that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) business to brush hair, and button boots, and pick things up and lay them away.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was, however, only an untrained Yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland cottage with a swarm of little brothers and sisters who had never dreamed of doing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger ones who were either babies in arms or just learning to totter about and tumble over things.
<p/>If Mary Lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) would perhaps have laughed at Martha's readiness to talk, but Mary only listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) coldly and wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) freedom of manner.
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not at all interested, but gradually, as the girl rattled on in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good-tempered, homely way, Mary began to notice what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was saying.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said that very often--<div class="bookquote">``It was the custom. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>The native servants were always saying it. '' Eh! you should see 'em all,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' There's twelve of us an' my father only gets sixteen shilling a week. I can tell you my mother's put to it to get porridge for 'em all.
<p/>They tumble about on th' moor an' play there all day an' mother says th' air of th' moor fattens 'em.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) believes they eat th' grass same as th' wild ponies do. Our Dickon, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s twelve years old and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s got a young pony he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) calls his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found it on th' moor with its mother when it was a little one an' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began to make friends with it an' give it bits o' bread an' pluck young grass for it.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) get it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary. '' And it got to like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so it follows him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) about an
<p/>' it lets him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) get on its back. Dickon's a kind lad an' animals likes him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). '' Mary had never possessed an animal pet of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own and had always thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should like one.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to feel a slight interest in Dickon, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never before been interested in any one but herself, it was the dawning of a healthy sentiment.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went into the room which had been made into a nursery for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found that it was rather like the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had slept in.
<p/>It was not a child's room, but a grown-up person's room, with gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old oak chairs.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had always had a very small appetite, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked with something more than indifference at the first plate Martha set before her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>A table in the center was set with a good substantial breakfast. '' I don't want it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. '' Tha' doesn't want thy porridge!''
<p/>Martha exclaimed incredulously. '' No.'' <div class="bookquote">``Tha' doesn't know how good it is. Put a bit o' treacle on it or a bit o' sugar.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>repeated Mary. '' Eh!'' said Martha. '' I can't abide to see good victuals go to waste.
<p/>If our children was at this table they'd clean it bare in five minutes. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary coldly. <div class="bookquote">``Why! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>echoed Martha.
<p/>'' Because they scarce ever had their stomachs full in their lives. They're as hungry as young hawks an' foxes. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what it is to be hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, with the indifference of ignorance. Martha looked indignant. '' Well, it would do thee good to try it.
<p/>I can see that plain enough,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said outspokenly. '' I've no patience with folk as sits an' just stares at good bread an' meat.
<p/>My word! don't I wish Dickon and Phil an' Jane an' th' rest of 'em had what's here under their pinafores.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you take it to them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>suggested Mary. '' It's not mine,'' answered Martha stoutly. '' An' this isn't my day out.
<p/>I get my day out once a month same as th' rest. Then I go home an' clean up for mother an' give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a day's rest.
<p/>'' Mary drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade. '' You wrap up warm an' run out an' play you,'' said Martha.
<p/>'' It'll do you good and give you some stomach for your meat. '' Mary went to the window. There were gardens and paths and big trees, but everything looked dull and wintry.
<p/>'' Out? Why should I go out on a day like this?'' '' Well, if tha' doesn't go out tha`lt have to stay in, an' what has tha' got to do?
<p/>'' Mary glanced about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). There was nothing to do. When Mrs. Medlock had prepared the nursery she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had not thought of amusement.
<p/>Perhaps it would be better to go and see what the gardens were like. '' Who will go with me? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) inquired.
<p/>Martha stared. '' You'll go by yourself,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) answered. '' You'll have to learn to play like other children does when they haven't got sisters and brothers.
<p/>Our Dickon goes off on th' moor by himself an' plays for hours. That's how he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) made friends with th' pony.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s got sheep on th' moor that knows him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), an' birds as comes an' eats out of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hand. However little there is to eat, he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) always saves a bit o' his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) bread to coax his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) pets.
<p/>It was really this mention of Dickon which made Mary decide to go out, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not aware of it.
<p/>'' There would be, birds outside though there would not be ponies or sheep. They would be different from the birds in India and it might amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to look at them.
<p/>Martha found her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) coat and hat for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and a pair of stout little boots and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) way downstairs.
<p/>If tha' goes round that way tha'll come to th' gardens,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, pointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery.
<p/>'' '' There's lots o' flowers in summer-time, but there's nothin' bloomin' now. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) seemed to hesitate a second before she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``One of th' gardens is locked up.
<p/>No one has been in it for ten years. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary in spite of herself. Here was another locked door added to the hundred in the strange house.
<p/>'' Mr. Craven had it shut when his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wife died so sudden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) won't let no one go inside. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) garden.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) locked th' door an' dug a hole and buried th' key. There's Mrs. Medlock's bell ringing--I must run. '' After she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was gone Mary turned down the walk which led to the door in the shrubbery.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could not help thinking about the garden which no one had been into for ten years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) wondered what it would look like and whether there were any flowers still alive in it.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had passed through the shrubbery gate she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) found herself in great gardens, with wide lawns and winding walks with clipped borders.
<p/>There were trees, and flower-beds, and evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and a large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst.
<p/>But the flower-beds were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing. This was not the garden which was shut up.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was just thinking this when she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) saw that, at the end of the path she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was following, there seemed to be a long wall, with ivy growing over it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was not familiar enough with England to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was coming upon the kitchen-gardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in the ivy, and that it stood open.
<p/>How could a garden be shut up? You could always walk into a garden. This was not the closed garden, evidently, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could go into it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls all round it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which seemed to open into one another.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) saw another open green door, revealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables. Fruit-trees were trained flat against the wall, and over some of the beds there were glass frames.
<p/>The place was bare and ugly enough, Mary thought, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood and stared about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). It might be nicer in summer when things were green, but there was nothing pretty about it now.
<p/>Presently an old man with a spade over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder walked through the door leading from the second garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked startled when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw Mary, and then touched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cap.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a surly old face, and did not seem at all pleased to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)--but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was displeased with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) garden and wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``quite contrary''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>expression, and certainly did not seem at all pleased to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' What is this place? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked. '' One o' th' kitchen-gardens,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered. '' What is that?'' said Mary, pointing through the other green door.
<p/>'' Another of 'em,'' shortly. '' There's another on t`other side o' th' wall an' there's th' orchard t`other side o' that.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I go in them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary. '' If tha' likes. But there's nowt to see. '' Mary made no response.
<p/>There, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found more walls and winter vegetables and glass frames, but in the second wall there was another green door and it was not open.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went down the path and through the second green door. Perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for ten years.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not at all a timid child and always did what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to do, Mary went to the green door and turned the handle.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hoped the door would not open because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to be sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found the mysterious garden--but it did open quite easily and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked through it and found herself in an orchard.
<p/>all round it also and trees trained against them, and there were bare fruit-trees growing in the winter-browned grass--but there was no green door to be seen anywhere.
<p/>Mary looked for it, and yet when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had entered the upper end of the garden she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had noticed that the wall did not seem to end with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place at the other side.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see the tops of trees above the wall, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood still she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on the topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) burst into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) winter song--almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and was calling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped and listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and somehow his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cheerful, friendly little whistle gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a pleased feeling--even a disagreeable little girl may be lonely, and the big closed house and big bare moor and big bare gardens had made this one feel as if there was no one left in the world but herself.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been an affectionate child, who had been used to being loved, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have broken her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart, but even though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``Mistress Mary Quite Contrary''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was desolate, and the bright-breasted little bird brought a look into her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sour little face which was almost a smile.
<p/>There were walls She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) flew away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not like an Indian bird and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) again.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lived in the mysterious garden and knew all about it. Perhaps it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had nothing whatever to do that
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought so much of the deserted garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was curious about it and wanted to see what it was like.
<p/>Why had Mr. Archibald Craven buried the key? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wife so much why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hate her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) garden?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew that if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) would not like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should only stand and stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) and say nothing, though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should be wanting dreadfully to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had done such a queer thing.
<p/>'' People never like me and I never like people,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought. '' And I never can talk as the Crawford children could.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thought of the robin and of the way he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) seemed to sing his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) song at her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) remembered the tree-top he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) perched on she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) stopped rather suddenly on the path.
<p/>They were always talking and laughing and making noises. '' '' I believe that tree was in the secret garden--I feel sure it was,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' There was a wall round the place and there was no door. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) walked back into the first kitchen-garden she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had entered and found the old man digging there.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) went and stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a few moments in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cold little way. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
<p/>and so at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' I have been into the other gardens,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) said. '' There was nothin' to prevent thee,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered crustily.
<p/>'' I went into the orchard. '' '' There was no dog at th' door to bite thee,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered. ''
<p/>There was no door there into the other garden,'' said Mary. '' What garden? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said in a rough voice, stopping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) digging for a moment.
<p/>'' The one on the other side of the wall,'' answered Mistress Mary. '' There are trees there--I saw the tops of them.
<p/>A bird with a red breast was sitting on one of them and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sang. '' To her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) surprise the surly old weather-beaten face actually changed its expression.
<p/>A slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite different. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) think that it was curious how much nicer a person looked when he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) smiled.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not thought of it before. He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) turned about to the orchard side of his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) garden and began to whistle--a low soft whistle.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not understand how such a surly man could make such a coaxing sound. Almost the next moment a wonderful thing happened.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard a soft little rushing flight through the air--and it was the bird with the red breast flying to them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) actually alighted on the big clod of earth quite near to the gardener's foot.
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is,'' chuckled the old man, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke to the bird as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were speaking to a child.
<p/>'' '' Where has tha' been, tha' cheeky little beggar? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) said. '' I've not seen thee before today. Has tha, begun tha' courtin' this early in th' season?
<p/>The bird put his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) tiny head on one side and looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) soft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop.
<p/>Tha`rt too forrad. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) seemed quite familiar and not the least afraid. He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) hopped about and pecked the earth briskly, looking for seeds and insects.
<p/>It actually gave Mary a queer feeling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart, because he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a person.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak, and slender delicate legs. '' Will he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) always come when you call him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked almost in a whisper. '' Aye, that he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) will. I've knowed him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was a fledgling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) come out of th' nest in th' other garden an' when first he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) flew over th' wall he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was too weak to fly back for a few days
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) went over th' wall again th' rest of th' brood was gone an' he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was lonely an' he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) come back to me.''
<p/>an' we got friendly. <div class="bookquote">``What kind of a bird is he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary asked. '' Doesn't tha' know? He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)'s a robin redbreast
<p/>an' they're th' friendliest, curiousest birds alive. They're almost as friendly as dogs--if you know how to get on with 'em.
<p/>Watch him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) peckin' about there an' lookin' round at us now an' again. He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) knows we're talkin' about him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>). '' It was the queerest thing in the world to see the old fellow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) looked at the plump little scarlet-waistcoated bird as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) were both proud and fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). '' He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s a conceited one,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chuckled.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) likes to hear folk talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). An' curious--bless me, there never was his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) like for curiosity an' meddlin'.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s always comin' to see what I'm plantin'. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knows all th' things Mester Craven never troubles hissel' to find out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s th' head gardener, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) is. '' The robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stopped and looked at them a little.
<p/>Mary thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) black dewdrop eyes gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with great curiosity. It really seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) were finding out all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>The queer feeling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart increased. '' Where did the rest of the brood fly to? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked. ''
<p/>There's no knowin'. The old ones turn 'em out o' their nest an' make 'em fly an' they're scattered before you know it.
<p/>This one was a knowin' one an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was lonely. '' Mistress Mary went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) very hard.
<p/>'' I'm lonely,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not known before that this was one of the things which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feel sour and cross.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seemed to find it out when the robin looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked at the robin. The old gardener pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) cap back on his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) bald head and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a minute.
<p/>'' Art tha' th' little wench from India?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) asked. Mary nodded. '' Then no wonder tha`rt lonely. Tha`lt be lonlier before tha's done,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) began to dig again, driving his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) spade deep into the rich black garden soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) answered, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) added with a surly chuckle, <div class="bookquote">``I'm lonely mysel' except when he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) jerked his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) thumb toward the robin.
<p/>'' What is your name?'' Mary inquired. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) stood up to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s th' only friend I've got.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I have no friends at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' I never had. My Ayah didn't like me and I never played with any one.
<p/>It is a Yorkshire habit to say what you think with blunt frankness, and old Ben Weatherstaff was a Yorkshire moor man.
<p/>'' '' Tha' an' me are a good bit alike,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said. '' We was wove out of th' same cloth.
<p/>We're neither of us good lookin ' an' we're both of us as sour as we look. We've got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I'll warrant.
<p/>'' This was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard the truth about herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) life. Native servants always salaamed and submitted to you, whatever you did.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) had never thought much about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) looks, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) also wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) looked as sour as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had looked before the robin came.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) actually began to wonder also if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``nasty tempered. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) felt uncomfortable. Suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) turned round.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) was standing a few feet from a young apple-tree and the robin had flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of a song.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff laughed outright. '' What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) do that for? '' asked Mary. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) mind to make friends with thee,'' replied Ben.
<p/>'' Dang me if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) hasn't took a fancy to thee.'' <div class="bookquote">``To me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) moved toward the little tree softly and looked up.
<p/>'' Would you make friends with me? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to the robin just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was speaking to a person.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not say it either in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hard little voice or in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) imperious Indian voice, but in a tone so soft and eager and coaxing that Ben Weatherstaff was as surprised as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) whistle.
<p/>Why,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) cried out, <div class="bookquote">``tha' said that as nice an' human as if tha' was a real child instead of a sharp old woman.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Would you? '' '' Tha' said it almost like Dickon talks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) wild things on th' moor. '' <div class="bookquote">``Do you know Dickon?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary asked, turning round rather in a hurry. '' Everybody knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>). Dickon's wanderin' about everywhere. Th' very blackberries an' heather-bells knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/>I warrant th' foxes shows him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) where their cubs lies an' th' skylarks doesn't hide their nests from him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>). '' Mary would have liked to ask some more questions.
<p/>But just that moment the robin, who had ended his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) song, gave a little shake of his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wings, spread them and flew away.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was almost as curious about Dickon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was about the deserted garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) visit and had other things to do.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) has flown over the wall!'' Mary cried out, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>). '' He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) has flown into the orchard--he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) has flown across the other wall--into the garden where there is no door!''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) lives there,'' said old Ben. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) came out o' th' egg there. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'s courtin', he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'s makin' up to some young madam of a robin that lives among th' old rose-trees there.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rose-trees,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' Are there rose-trees?'' Ben Weatherstaff took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) spade again and began to dig. '' There was ten year' ago,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) mumbled.
<p/>'' I should like to see them,'' said Mary. '' Where is the green door? There must be a door somewhere.
<p/>'' Ben drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) had looked when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>). '' There was ten year' ago, but there isn't now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' No door!'' cried Mary. '' There must be.'' '' None as any one can find, an' none as is any one's business.
<p/>Don't you be a meddlesome wench an' poke your nose where it's no cause to go. Here, I must go on with my work.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) actually stopped digging, threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) spade over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) shoulder and walked off, without even glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) or saying good-by.
<p/>Get you gone an' play you. I've no more time. '' CHAPTER V THE CRY IN THE CORRIDOR At first each day which passed by for Mary Lennox was exactly like the others.
<p/>Every morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) awoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) tapestried room and found Martha kneeling upon the hearth building her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) fire; every morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) breakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after each breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) gazed out of the window across to the huge moor which seemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky, and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had stared for a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) realized that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not go out she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) would have to stay in and do nothing--and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) went out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not know that this was the best thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could have done, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not know that, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) began to walk quickly or even run along the paths and down the avenue, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was stirring her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) slow blood and making herself stronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ran only to make herself warm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hated the wind which rushed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) face and roared and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) back as if it were some giant she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could not see.
<p/>But the big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) lungs with something which was good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) whole thin body and whipped some red color into her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) cheeks and brightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) dull eyes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not know anything about it.
<p/>But after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wakened one morning knowing what it was to be hungry, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) sat down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not glance disdainfully at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) porridge and push it away, but took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it until her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) bowl was empty.
<p/>'' Tha' got on well enough with that this mornin', didn't tha'?'' said Martha. '' It tastes nice today,'' said Mary, feeling a little surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) self.
<p/>'' It's th' air of th' moor that's givin' thee stomach for tha' victuals,'' answered Martha. '' It's lucky for thee that tha's got victuals as well as appetite.
<p/>There's been twelve in our cottage as had th' stomach an' nothin' to put in it. You go on playin' you out o' doors every day an' you'll get some flesh on your bones
<p/>an' you won't be so yeller.'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't play,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' I have nothing to play with. '' <div class="bookquote">``Nothin' to play with!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Martha.
<p/>'' Our children plays with sticks and stones. They just runs about an' shouts an' looks at things. '' Mary did not shout, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked at things.
<p/>There was nothing else to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked round and round the gardens and wandered about the paths in the park.
<p/>Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked for Ben Weatherstaff, but though several times she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) at work he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was too busy to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) or was too surly.
<p/>Once when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was walking toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) spade and turned away as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did it on purpose.
<p/>One place she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went to oftener than to any other. It was the long walk outside the gardens with the walls round them.
<p/>There were bare flower-beds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly. There was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves were more bushy than elsewhere.
<p/>The rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat, but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed at all.
<p/>A few days after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had talked to Ben Weatherstaff, Mary stopped to notice this and wondered why it was so.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had just paused and was looking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw a gleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top of the wall, forward perched Ben Weatherstaff's robin redbreast, tilting forward to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) small head on one side.
<p/>It seemed as if for a long time that part had been neglected. '' Oh! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried out, <div class="bookquote">``is it you--is it you?
<p/>And it did not seem at all queer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) would understand and answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) were telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) all sorts of things.
<p/>It seemed to Mistress Mary as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>), too, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was not speaking in words. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Good morning!
<p/>Isn't the wind nice? Isn't the sun nice? Isn't everything nice? Let us both chirp and hop and twitter. Come on!
<p/>Come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mary began to laugh, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) hopped and took little flights along the wall she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried out, pattering down the walk; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chirped and tried to whistle, which last she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know how to do in the least.
<p/>Poor little thin, sallow, ugly Mary--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) actually looked almost pretty for a moment. '' I like you! I like you!'' But the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped and whistled back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) spread his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wings and made a darting flight to the top of a tree, where he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) perched and sang loudly.
<p/>That reminded Mary of the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had been swinging on a tree-top then and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been standing in the orchard.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the path outside a wall--much lower down--and there was the same tree inside.
<p/>'' It's in the garden no one can go into,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to herself. '' It's the garden without a door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) lives in there. How I wish I could see what it is like!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran up the walk to the green door she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had entered the first morning.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran down the path through the other door and then into the orchard, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood and looked up there was the tree on the other side of the wall, and there was the robin just finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) song and, beginning to preen his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) feathers with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) beak.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) only found what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found before--that there was no door in it.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran through the kitchen-gardens again and out into the walk outside the long ivy-covered wall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked to the end of it and looked at it, but there was no door; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked to the other end, looking again, but there was no door.
<p/>'' It is the garden,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' I am sure it is. '' '' It's very queer,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. ''
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff said there was no door and there is no door. But there must have been one ten years ago, because Mr. Craven buried the key.
<p/>This gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) so much to think of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to be quite interested and feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had come to Misselthwaite Manor.
<p/>The fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had begun to blow the cobwebs out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) young brain and to waken her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) up a little.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) supper at night she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable.
<p/>'' In India she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had always felt hot and too languid to care much about anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not feel cross when Martha chattered away.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) rather liked to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) a question.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) asked it after she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) supper and had sat down on the hearth-rug before the fire. '' Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was very young, and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers and sisters, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) found it dull in the great servants' hall downstairs where the footman and upper-housemaids made fun of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) Yorkshire speech and looked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) as a common little thing, and sat and whispered among themselves.
<p/>Martha liked to talk, and the strange child who had lived in India, and been waited upon by <div class="bookquote">``blacks,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>was novelty enough to attract her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had made Martha stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and Martha had not objected at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked.
<p/>'' Art tha' thinkin' about that garden yet? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. '' I knew tha' would. That was just the way with me when I first heard about it.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hate it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary persisted. Martha tucked her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) feet under her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and made herself quite comfortable. '' Listen to th' wind wutherin' round the house,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' You could bare stand up on the moor if you was out on it tonight. '' Mary did not know what <div class="bookquote">``wutherin'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>meant until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) listened, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) understood.
<p/>It must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar which rushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see were buffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in.
<p/>But one knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not get in, and somehow it made one feel very safe and warm inside a room with a red coal fire.
<p/>'' But why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hate it so? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had listened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) intended to know if Martha did.
<p/>Then Martha gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) store of knowledge. '' Mind,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Medlock said it's not to be talked about.
<p/>There's lots o' things in this place that's not to be talked over. That's Mr. Craven's orders. His (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) troubles are none servants' business, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) says.
<p/>It was Mrs. Craven's garden that she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had made when first they were married an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) just loved it, an' they used to `tend the flowers themselves.
<p/>But for th' garden he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wouldn't be like he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) is. An' none o' th' gardeners was ever let to go in.
<p/>An' she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was just a bit of a girl an' there was an old tree with a branch bent like a seat on it.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) an' her (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) used to go in an' shut th' door an' stay there hours an' hours, readin' and talkin'. An' she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) made roses grow over it an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) used to sit there.
<p/>But one day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was sittin' there th' branch broke an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) fell on th' ground an' was hurt so bad that next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) died.
<p/>Th' doctors thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'d go out o' his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) mind an' die, too. That's why he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hates it. No one's never gone in since, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) won't let any one talk about it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mary did not ask any more questions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked at the red fire and listened to the wind <div class="bookquote">``wutherin'. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed to be <div class="bookquote">``wutherin'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>louder than ever. At that moment a very good thing was happening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Four good things had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), in fact, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came to Misselthwaite Manor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had understood a robin and that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had run in the wind until her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) blood had grown warm; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been healthily hungry for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found out what it was to be sorry for some one.
<p/>But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was listening to the wind she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to listen to something else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know what it was, because at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could scarcely distinguish it from the wind itself.
<p/>Sometimes the wind sounded rather like a child crying, but presently Mistress Mary felt quite sure this sound was inside the house, not outside it.
<p/>It was a curious sound--it seemed almost as if a child were crying somewhere. It was far away, but it was inside.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned round and looked at Martha. '' Do you hear any one crying? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. Martha suddenly looked confused.
<p/>'' No,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) answered. '' It's th' wind. Sometimes it sounds like as if some one was lost on th' moor an' wailin'.
<p/>It's got all sorts o' sounds.'' '' But listen,'' said Mary. '' It's in the house--down one of those long corridors.
<p/>And at that very moment a door must have been opened somewhere downstairs; for a great rushing draft blew along the passage and the door of the room they sat in was blown open with a crash, and as they both jumped to their feet the light was blown out and the crying sound was swept down the far corridor so that it was to be heard more plainly than ever.
<p/>'' '' There!'' said Mary. '' I told you so! It is some one crying--and it isn't a grown-up person. ''
<p/>Martha ran and shut the door and turned the key, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did it they both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with a bang, and then everything was quiet, for even the wind ceased <div class="bookquote">``wutherin'''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for a few moments.
<p/>'' It was th' wind,'' said Martha stubbornly. '' An' if it wasn't, it was little Betty Butterworth, th' scullery-maid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>)'s had th' toothache all day.
<p/>'' But something troubled and awkward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Betty</b></font>) manner made Mistress Mary stare very hard at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was speaking the truth.
<p/>The next day the rain poured down in torrents again, and when Mary looked out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and cloud.
<p/>CHAPTER VI <div class="bookquote">``THERE WAS SOME ONE CRYING--THERE WAS! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There could be no going out today. '' What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked Martha. <div class="bookquote">``Try to keep from under each other's feet mostly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>Martha answered. '' Eh! there does seem a lot of us then.
<p/>Mother's a good-tempered woman but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) gets fair moithered. The biggest ones goes out in th' cow-shed and plays there. Dickon he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) doesn't mind th' wet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) goes out just th' same as if th' sun was shinin'. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sees things on rainy days as doesn't show when it's fair weather.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brought it home in th' bosom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) shirt to keep it warm.
<p/>Its mother had been killed nearby an' th' hole was swum out an' th' rest o' th' litter was dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'s got it at home now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found a half-drowned young crow another time an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brought it home, too, an' tamed it. It's named Soot because it's so black, an' it hops an' flies about with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) everywhere.
<p/>'' The time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent Martha's familiar talk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped or went away.
<p/>The stories she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been told by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Ayah when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lived in India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell about the moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four little rooms and never had quite enough to eat.
<p/>The children seemed to tumble about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured collie puppies. Mary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon.
<p/>When Martha told stories of what <div class="bookquote">``mother''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said or did they always sounded comfortable. '' If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it,'' said Mary.
<p/>'' But I have nothing. '' Martha looked perplexed. '' Can tha' knit? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) asked. '' No,'' answered Mary. ''
<p/>Can tha' sew?'' <div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can tha' read?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Then why doesn't tha, read somethin', or learn a bit o' spellin'?
<p/>Tha`st old enough to be learnin' thy book a good bit now. '' <div class="bookquote">``I haven't any books,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' Those I had were left in India.''
<p/>'' That's a pity,'' said Martha. '' If Mrs. Medlock'd let thee go into th' library, there's thousands o' books there.
<p/>'' Mary did not ask where the library was, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was suddenly inspired by a new idea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind to go and find it herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not troubled about Mrs. Medlock. Mrs. Medlock seemed always to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) comfortable housekeeper's sitting-room downstairs. In this queer place one scarcely ever saw any one at all.
<p/>In fact, there was no one to see but the servants, and when their master was away they lived a luxurious life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung about with shining brass and pewter, and a large servants' hall where there were four or five abundant meals eaten every day, and where a great deal of lively romping went on when Mrs. Medlock was out of the way.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock came and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) every day or two, but no one inquired what she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did or told her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) what to do.
<p/>Mary's meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), but no one troubled themselves about her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) in the least. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) supposed that perhaps this was the English way of treating children.
<p/>In India she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had always been attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) Ayah, who had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) about and waited on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), hand and foot.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was followed by nobody and was learning to dress herself because Martha looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was silly and stupid when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wanted to have things handed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and put on.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had often been tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) company. '' Hasn't tha' got good sense? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said once, when Mary had stood waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gloves for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>'' Our Susan Ann is twice as sharp as thee an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>)'s only four year' old. Sometimes tha' looks fair soft in th' head.
<p/>'' Mary had worn her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) think several entirely new things.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Martha had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not care very much about the library itself, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) mind the hundred rooms with closed doors.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wondered if they were all really locked and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) would find if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could get into any of them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was thinking over the new idea which had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) heard of the library. Were there a hundred really?
<p/>Why shouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) go and see how many doors she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could count? It would be something to do on this morning when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could not go out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had never been taught to ask permission to do things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knew nothing at all about authority, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) would not have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) might walk about the house, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/>It was a long corridor and it branched into other corridors and it led her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) up short flights of steps which mounted to others again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) began her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) wanderings. There were doors and doors, and there were pictures on the walls.
<p/>Sometimes they were pictures of dark, curious landscapes, but oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer, grand costumes made of satin and velvet.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) found herself in one long gallery whose walls were covered with these portraits. She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had never thought there could be so many in any house.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) walked slowly down this place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from India was doing in their house.
<p/>Some were pictures of children--little girls in thick satin frocks which reached to their feet and stood out about them, and boys with puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair, or with big ruffs around their necks.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) always stopped to look at the children, and wonder what their names were, and where they had gone, and why they wore such odd clothes.
<p/>There was a stiff, plain little girl rather like herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) finger.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes had a sharp, curious look. '' Where do you live now?'' said Mary aloud to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' I wish you were here.
<p/>It seemed as if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own small self, wandering about upstairs and down, through narrow passages and wide ones, where it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that no one but herself had ever walked.
<p/>Since so many rooms had been built, people must have lived in them, but it all seemed so empty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not quite believe it true.
<p/>'' Surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning. It was not until she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) climbed to the second floor that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought of turning the handle of a door.
<p/>All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlock had said they were, but at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) hand on the handle of one of them and turned it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was almost frightened for a moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) felt that it turned without difficulty and that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) pushed upon the door itself it slowly and heavily opened.
<p/>There were embroidered hangings on the wall, and inlaid furniture such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had seen in India stood about the room.
<p/>A broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor; and over the mantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little girl who seemed to stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more curiously than ever.
<p/>It was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom. '' Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slept here once,'' said Mary. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stares at me so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) makes me feel queer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw so many rooms that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not counted them.
<p/>'' After that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened more doors and more. In all of them there were old pictures or old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them.
<p/>In one room, which looked like a lady's sitting-room, the hangings were all embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were about a hundred little elephants made of ivory.
<p/>There were curious pieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of them. They were of different sizes, and some had their mahouts or palanquins on their backs.
<p/>Some were much bigger than the others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies. Mary had seen carved ivory in India and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew all about elephants.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened the door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with these for quite a long time.
<p/>In all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen nothing alive; but in this room she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw something.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got tired she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) set the elephants in order and shut the door of the cabinet. Just after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had closed the cabinet door she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard a tiny rustling sound.
<p/>In the corner of the sofa there was a cushion, and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it.
<p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace, from which it seemed to come. Mary crept softly across the room to look.
<p/>The bright eyes belonged to a little gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a comfortable nest there.
<p/>If there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there were seven mice who did not look lonely at all.
<p/>Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep near her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' If they wouldn't be so frightened I would take them back with me,'' said Mary.
<p/>Two or three times she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) way by turning down the wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and down until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found the right one; but at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own floor again, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was some distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own room and did not know exactly where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was.
<p/>I believe I have taken a wrong turning again,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, standing still at what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the wall.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any farther, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned back. '' '' I don't know which way to go.
<p/>It was while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was standing here and just after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had said this that the stillness was broken by a sound.
<p/>It was another cry, but not quite like the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had heard last night; it was only a short one, a fretful childish whine muffled by passing through walls.
<p/>How still everything is! '' '' It's nearer than it was,'' said Mary, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart beating rather faster. '' And it is crying.
<p/>The tapestry was the covering of a door which fell open and showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that there was another part of the corridor behind it, and Mrs. Medlock was coming up it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bunch of keys in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand and a very cross look on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and then sprang back, feeling quite startled. '' What are you doing here?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took Mary by the arm and pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) away. '' What did I tell you?'' ''
<p/>I turned round the wrong corner,'' explained Mary. '' I didn't know which way to go and I heard some one crying.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) quite hated Mrs. Medlock at the moment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) more the next. '' You didn't hear anything of the sort,'' said the housekeeper.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) by the arm and half pushed, half pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) up one passage and down another until she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) in at the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) own room.
<p/>'' You come along back to your own nursery or I'll box your ears. '' '' Now,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you stay where you're told to stay or
<p/>you'll find yourself locked up. The master had better get you a governess, same as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would. You're one that needs some one to look sharp after you.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) went out of the room and slammed the door after her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), and Mary went and sat on the hearth-rug, pale with rage.
<p/>I've got enough to do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not cry, but ground her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) teeth. '' There was some one crying--there was--there was!''
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had heard it twice now, and sometime she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would find out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found out a great deal this morning.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been on a long journey, and at any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had had something to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) all the time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray mouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion.
<p/>CHAPTER VII THE KEY TO THE GARDEN Two days after this, when Mary opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat upright in bed immediately, and called to Martha.
<p/>'' Look at the moor! Look at the moor! '' The rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept away in the night by the wind.
<p/>The wind itself had ceased and a brilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland. Never, never had Mary dreamed of a sky so blue.
<p/>In India skies were hot and blazing; this was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters of some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece.
<p/>The far-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of gloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray. <div class="bookquote">``Aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha with a cheerful grin.
<p/>'' Th' storm's over for a bit. It does like this at this time o' th' year. It goes off in a night like it was pretendin' it had never been here
<p/>an' never meant to come again. That's because th' springtime's on its way. It's a long way off yet, but it's comin'.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in England,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary said. '' Eh! no! '' said Martha, sitting up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) heels among her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) black lead brushes.
<p/>In India the natives spoke different dialects which only a few people understood, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was not surprised when Martha used words she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not know.
<p/>'' Nowt o' th' soart!'' <div class="bookquote">``What does that mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary seriously. Martha laughed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had done the first morning.
<p/>'' There now,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. '' I've talked broad Yorkshire again like Mrs. Medlock said I mustn't. ' Nowt o' th' soart' means `nothin'-of-the-sort,''' slowly and carefully, <div class="bookquote">``but it takes so long to say it.
<p/>Yorkshire's th' sunniest place on earth when it is sunny. I told thee tha'd like th' moor after a bit. Just you wait till you see
<p/>th' gold-colored gorse blossoms an' th' blossoms o' th' broom, an' th' heather flowerin', all purple bells, an' hundreds o' butterflies flutterin' an' bees hummin' an' skylarks soarin' up an' singin'.
<p/>You'll want to get out on it as sunrise an' live out on it all day like Dickon does. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Could I ever get there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary wistfully, looking through her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) window at the far-off blue.
<p/>It was so new and big and wonderful and such a heavenly color. '' I don't know,'' answered Martha. '' Tha's never used tha' legs since tha' was born, it seems to me.
<p/>Martha stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) a moment curiously before she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) polishing brush and began to rub the grate again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was thinking that the small plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done the first morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) saw it.
<p/>Tha' couldn't walk five mile. It's five mile to our cottage.'' <div class="bookquote">``I should like to see your cottage. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan Ann</b></font>)</div>It looked just a trifle like little Susan Ann's when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) wanted something very much.
<p/>'' I'll ask my mother about it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) said. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>)'s one o' them that nearly always sees a way to do things.
<p/>It's my day out today an' I'm goin' home. Eh! I am glad. Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o' mother. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' I should think tha' did,'' agreed Martha, polishing away. '' I've never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>),'' said Mary.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat up on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heels again and rubbed the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nose with the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand as if puzzled for a moment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ended quite positively.
<p/>Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'s that sensible an' hard workin' an' goodnatured an' clean that no one could help likin' her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whether they'd seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) or not.
<p/>'' No, tha' hasn't,'' replied Martha. '' When I'm goin' home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) on my day out I just jump for joy when I'm crossin' the moor.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I like Dickon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>added Mary. '' And I've never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).'' '' Well,'' said Martha stoutly, <div class="bookquote">``I've told thee that th' very birds likes him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
<p/>an' th' rabbits an' wild sheep an' ponies, an' th' foxes themselves. I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) reflectively, <div class="bookquote">``what Dickon would think of thee?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wouldn't like me,'' said Mary in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stiff, cold little way. '' No one does. '' Martha looked reflective again.
<p/>'' How does tha' like thysel'? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) inquired, really quite as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) were curious to know. Mary hesitated a moment and thought it over.
<p/>'' Not at all--really,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered. '' But I never thought of that before. '' Martha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wash-tub an' I was in a bad temper an' talkin' ill of folk, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) turns round on me an' says: `Tha' young vixen, tha'!
<p/>'' Mother said that to me once,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said. '' There tha' stands sayin' tha' doesn't like this one an' tha' doesn't like that one.
<p/>How does tha' like thysel'?' It made me laugh an' it brought me to my senses in a minute. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) went away in high spirits as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) had given Mary her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breakfast.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was going to walk five miles across the moor to the cottage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was going to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother with the washing and do the week's baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went out into the garden as quickly as possible, and the first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did was to run round and round the fountain flower garden ten times.
<p/>Mary felt lonelier than ever when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was no longer in the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) counted the times carefully and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had finished she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt in better spirits.
<p/>The high, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite as well as over the moor, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) kept lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face and looking up into it, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of the little snow-white clouds and float about.
<p/>The sunshine made the whole place look different. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went into the first kitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with two other gardeners.
<p/>The change in the weather seemed to have done him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) own accord. '' Springtime's comin,''' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Cannot tha' smell it?'' Mary sniffed and thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could. '' I smell something nice and fresh and damp,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' That's th' good rich earth,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) answered, digging away. '' It's in a good humor makin' ready to grow things.
<p/>It's glad when plantin' time comes. It's dull in th' winter when it's got nowt to do. In th' flower gardens out there things will be stirrin' down below in th' dark.
<p/>Th' sun's warmin' 'em. You'll see bits o' green spikes stickin' out o' th' black earth after a bit. '' <div class="bookquote">``What will they be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary.
<p/>'' Crocuses an' snowdrops an' daffydowndillys. Has tha' never seen them?'' '' No. Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in India,'' said Mary.
<p/>'' And I think things grow up in a night. '' '' These won't grow up in a night,'' said Weatherstaff.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha'll have to wait for 'em. They'll poke up a bit higher here, an' push out a spike more there, an' uncurl a leaf this day an' another that.
<p/>Very soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew at once that the robin had come again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was very pert and lively, and hopped about so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feet, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) head on one side and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) so slyly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked Ben Weatherstaff a question.
<p/>You watch 'em.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am going to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary. '' Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) remembers me? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' Remembers thee!
<p/>'' said Weatherstaff indignantly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) knows every cabbage stump in th' gardens, let alone th' people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s never seen a little wench here before, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s bent on findin' out all about thee.
<p/>Tha's no need to try to hide anything from him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>). '' <div class="bookquote">``Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) lives?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary inquired. '' What garden? '' grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again. '' The one where the old rose-trees are. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not help asking, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted so much to know.
<p/>'' Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer? Are there ever any roses?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) shoulders toward the robin. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s the only one as knows. No one else has seen inside it for ten year'.
<p/>'' Ten years was a long time, Mary thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been born ten years ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked away, slowly thinking.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had begun to like the garden just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Martha's mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was beginning to like Martha, too. That seemed a good many people to like--when you were not used to liking.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) walk outside the long, ivy-covered wall over which she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could see the tree-tops; and the second time she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) walked up and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), and it was all through Ben Weatherstaff's robin.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) looked at the bare flower-bed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) left side there he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was hopping about and pretending to peck things out of the earth to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had not followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and the surprise so filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) with delight that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) almost trembled a little.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) thought of the robin as one of the people. '' You do remember me! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) cried out. '' You do!
<p/>You are prettier than anything else in the world!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) hopped, and flirted his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) tail and twittered.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) red waistcoat was like satin and he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) puffed his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand and so pretty that it was really as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) were showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) how important and like a human person a robin could be.
<p/>Mistress Mary forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had ever been contrary in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to draw closer and closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), and bend down and talk and try to make something like robin sounds.
<p/>It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) were talking. Oh! to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) should actually let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) come as near to him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) as that!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) knew nothing in the world would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand toward him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) or startle him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) in the least tiniest way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) knew it because he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was a real person--only nicer than any other person in the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was so happy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) scarcely dared to breathe.
<p/>It was bare of flowers because the perennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest, but there were tall shrubs and low ones which grew together at the back of the bed, and as the robin hopped about under them she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) hop over a small pile of freshly turned up earth.
<p/>The earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a mole and he (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) had scratched quite a deep hole.
<p/>Mary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw something almost buried in the newly-turned soil.
<p/>It was something like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew up into a tree nearby she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand and picked the ring up.
<p/>It was more than a ring, however; it was an old key which looked as if it had been buried a long time.
<p/>The flower-bed was not quite bare. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stopped on it to look for a worm. Mistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face as it hung from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) finger.
<p/>'' Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said in a whisper. '' Perhaps it is the key to the garden!''
<p/>CHAPTER VIII THE ROBIN WHO SHOWED THE WAY She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked at the key quite a long time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned it over and over, and thought about it.
<p/>As I have said before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not a child who had been trained to ask permission or consult her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) elders about things.
<p/>All she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed garden, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could find out where the door was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could perhaps open it and see what was inside the walls, and what had happened to the old rose-trees.
<p/>It seemed as if it must be different from other places and that something strange must have happened to it during ten years.
<p/>Besides that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked it she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could go into it every day and shut the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could make up some play of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own and play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was, but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth.
<p/>It was because it had been shut up so long that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to see it. The thought of that pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very much.
<p/>Living as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuse herself, had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) inactive brain to working and was actually awakening her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) imagination.
<p/>There is no doubt that the fresh, strong, pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it.
<p/>Just as it had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) blood, so the same things had stirred her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind.
<p/>In India she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had always been too hot and languid and weak to care much about anything, but in this place she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was beginning to care and to want to do new things.
<p/>Already she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt less <div class="bookquote">``contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know why. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put the key in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pocket and walked up and down her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walk.
<p/>No one but herself ever seemed to come there, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on it.
<p/>The ivy was the baffling thing. Howsoever carefully she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see nothing but thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves.
<p/>Something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) contrariness came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) paced the walk and looked over it at the tree-tops inside.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was very much disappointed. It seemed so silly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took the key in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pocket when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went back to the house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would always carry it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went out, so that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ever should find the hidden door she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would be ready.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at the cottage, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever and in the best of spirits.
<p/>Eh! it was pretty on th' moor with th' birds gettin' up an' th' rabbits scamperin' about an' th' sun risin'.
<p/>'' I got up at four o'clock,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. '' I didn't walk all th' way. A man gave me a ride in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cart an' I did enjoy myself.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) mother had been glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and they had got the baking and washing all out of the way.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was full of stories of the delights of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) day out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had even made each of the children a doughcake with a bit of brown sugar in it.
<p/>'' I had 'em all pipin' hot when they came in from playin' on th' moor. An' th' cottage all smelt
<p/>o' nice, clean hot bakin ' an' there was a good fire, an' they just shouted for joy. Our Dickon he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said our cottage was good enough for a king.
<p/>In the evening they had all sat round the fire, and Martha and her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) mother had sewed patches on torn clothes and mended stockings and Martha had told them about the little girl who had come from India and who had been waited on all her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) life by what Martha called <div class="bookquote">``blacks''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>until she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) didn't know how to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) own stockings.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Eh! they did like to hear about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha. '' They wanted to know all about th' blacks an' about th' ship you came in.
<p/>I'll tell you a great deal more before your next day out,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``so that you will have more to talk about.
<p/>I dare say they would like to hear about riding on elephants and camels, and about the officers going to hunt tigers.
<p/>I couldn't tell 'em enough. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mary reflected a little. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``My word!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>cried delighted Martha. '' It would set 'em clean off their heads.
<p/>Would tha' really do that, Miss? It would be same as a wild beast show like we heard they had in York once.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``India is quite different from Yorkshire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary said slowly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought the matter over. '' I never thought of that.
<p/>Did Dickon and your mother like to hear you talk about me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, our Dickon's eyes nearly started out o' his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) head, they got that round,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>answered Martha.
<p/>'' But mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was put out about your seemin' to be all by yourself like. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, `Hasn't Mr. Craven got no governess for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), nor no nurse?'
<p/>and I said, `No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hasn't, though Mrs. Medlock says he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) will when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) thinks of it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) mayn't think of it for two or three years.'
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't want a governess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary sharply. '' But mother says you ought to be learnin' your book by this time
<p/>an' you ought to have a woman to look after you, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says: `Now, Martha, you just think how you'd feel yourself, in a big place like that, wanderin' about all alone, an' no mother.
<p/>You do your best to cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up,' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says, an' I said I would. '' Mary gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a long, steady look.
<p/>'' You do cheer me up,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' I like to hear you talk. '' Presently Martha went out of the room and came back with something held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hands under her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) apron.
<p/>'' What does tha' think,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, with a cheerful grin. '' I've brought thee a present.'' '' A present! '' exclaimed Mistress Mary.
<p/>How could a cottage full of fourteen hungry people give any one a present! '' A man was drivin' across the moor peddlin','' Martha explained.
<p/>'' An' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cart at our door. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had pots an' pans an' odds an' ends, but mother had no money to buy anythin'.
<p/>Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was goin' away our `Lizabeth Ellen called out, `Mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got skippin'-ropes with red an' blue handles.' An' mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) calls out quite sudden, `Here, stop, mister!
<p/>An' he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says `Tuppence', an' mother she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began fumblin' in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pocket an' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says to me, `Martha, tha's brought me thy wages like a good lass, an' I've got four places to put every penny, but I'm just goin' to take tuppence out of it to buy that child a skippin'-rope
<p/>How much are they?' ,' an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) bought one an' here it is. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) brought it out from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) apron and exhibited it quite proudly.
<p/>It was a strong, slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at each end, but Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) gazed at it with a mystified expression. '' What is it for? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) asked curiously. <div class="bookquote">``For!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>cried out Martha.
<p/>'' Does tha' mean that they've not got skippin'-ropes in India, for all they've got elephants and tigers and camels! No wonder most of 'em's black.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ran into the middle of the room and, taking a handle in each hand, began to skip, and skip, and skip, while Mary turned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chair to stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and the queer faces in the old portraits seemed to stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), too, and wonder what on earth this common little cottager had the impudence to be doing under their very noses.
<p/>The interest and curiosity in Mistress Mary's face delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went on skipping and counted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) skipped until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had reached a hundred.
<p/>This is what it's for; just watch me. '' But Martha did not even see them. '' I could skip longer than that,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) stopped.
<p/>I've skipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve, but I wasn't as fat then as I am now, an' I was in practice.
<p/>'' '' Mary got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chair beginning to feel excited herself. '' It looks nice,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' Your mother is a kind woman.
<p/>Do you think I could ever skip like that?'' <div class="bookquote">``You just try it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>urged Martha, handing her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) the skipping-rope. '' You can't skip a hundred at first, but if you practice you'll mount up.
<p/>That's what mother said. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says, `Nothin' will do her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) more good than skippin' rope. It's th' sensiblest toy a child can have.
<p/>Let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) play out in th' fresh air skippin' an' it'll stretch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) legs an' arms an' give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) some strength in 'em.'
<p/>It was plain that there was not a great deal of strength in Mistress Mary's arms and legs when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) first began to skip.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not very clever at it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked it so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not want to stop.
<p/>Mother said I must tell you to keep out o' doors as much as you could, even when it rains a bit, so as tha' wrap up warm.
<p/>'' Put on tha' things and run an' skip out o' doors,'' said Martha. '' '' Mary put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) coat and hat and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) skipping-rope over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arm.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened the door to go out, and then suddenly thought of something and turned back rather slowly. '' Martha,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``they were your wages.
<p/>It was your two-pence really. Thank you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said it stiffly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was not used to thanking people or noticing that they did things for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>'' Thank you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hand because she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not know what else to do. Martha gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hand a clumsy little shake, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was not accustomed to this sort of thing either.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) laughed. '' Eh! th' art a queer, old-womanish thing,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. '' If tha'd been our `Lizabeth Ellen tha'd have given me a kiss.
<p/>'' Mary looked stiffer than ever. '' Do you want me to kiss you?'' Martha laughed again. '' Nay, not me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'' If tha' was different, p`raps tha'd want to thysel'. But tha' isn't. Run off outside an' play with thy rope.
<p/>'' Mistress Mary felt a little awkward as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went out of the room. Yorkshire people seemed strange, and Martha was always rather a puzzle to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) counted and skipped, and skipped and counted, until her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) cheeks were quite red, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was more interested than she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had ever been since she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was born.
<p/>The sun was shining and a little wind was blowing--not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned earth with it.
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) very much, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not. The skipping-rope was a wonderful thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) skipped round the fountain garden, and up one walk and down another.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) skipped at last into the kitchen-garden and saw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) robin, which was hopping about him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) skipped down the walk toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) head and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) with a curious expression. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) would notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) skip. '' Well!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) exclaimed. '' Upon my word. P'raps tha' art a young '
<p/>un, after all, an' p`raps tha's got child's blood in thy veins instead of sour buttermilk. Tha's skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name's Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>I wouldn't have believed tha' could do it.'' <div class="bookquote">``I never skipped before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary said. '' I'm just beginning. I can only go up to twenty.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha' keep on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben. '' Tha' shapes well enough at it for a young ' un that's lived with heathen.
<p/>Just see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'s watchin' thee,'' jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) head toward the robin. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) followed after thee yesterday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'ll be at it again today.
<p/>'' shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) head at the bird, <div class="bookquote">``tha' curiosity will be th' death of thee sometime if tha' doesn't look sharp.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'ll be bound to find out what th' skippin'-rope is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'s never seen one. Eh! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting every few minutes.
<p/>At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own special walk and made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind to try if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could skip the whole length of it.
<p/>It was a good long skip and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began slowly, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had gone half-way down the path she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was so hot and breathless that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was obliged to stop.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped with a little laugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not mind much, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had already counted up to thirty. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with a chirp.
<p/>As Mary had skipped toward him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt something heavy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pocket strike against her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at each jump, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw the robin she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) laughed again.
<p/>'' You showed me where the key was yesterday,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' You ought to show me the door today; but I don't believe you know!
<p/>'' The robin flew from his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show off.
<p/>Nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) shows off--and they are nearly always doing it.
<p/>Mary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) Ayah's stories, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) always said that what happened almost at that moment was Magic.
<p/>One of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk, and it was a stronger one than the rest.
<p/>It was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees, and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall.
<p/>Mary had stepped close to the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy trails, and more suddenly still she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) jumped toward it and caught it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand.
<p/>This she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen something under it--a round knob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it.
<p/>It was the knob of a door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside.
<p/>Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain, though some had crept over wood and iron.
<p/>The robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) head on one side, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) were as excited as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was.
<p/>What was this under her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands which was square and made of iron and which her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fingers found a hole in?
<p/>Mary's heart began to thump and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands to shake a little in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) delight and excitement. It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put the key in and turned it.
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took a long breath and looked behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) up the long walk to see if any one was coming.
<p/>No one ever did come, it seemed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took another long breath, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not help it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly--slowly.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) slipped through it, and shut it behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) back against it, looking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.
<p/>It took two hands to do it, but it did turn. No one was coming. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was standing inside the secret garden.
<p/>CHAPTER IX THE STRANGEST HOUSE ANY ONE EVER LIVED IN It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine.
<p/>The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together.
<p/>All the ground was covered with grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rosebushes if they were alive.
<p/>Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) had seen a great many roses in India. There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees.
<p/>There were other trees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place look strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over them and swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and here and there they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching branch and had crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges of themselves.
<p/>There were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary did not know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass, where they had fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground.
<p/>Mary had thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left all by themselves so long; and indeed it was different from any other place she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had ever seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life.
<p/>It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. '' How still it is!''
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whispered. '' How still! '' Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had flown to his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) treetop, was still as all the rest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) did not even flutter his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wings; he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) sat without stirring, and looked at Mary. '' No wonder it is still,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whispered again.
<p/>'' I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were afraid of awakening some one.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked under one of the fairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was glad that there was grass under her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feet and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) steps made no sounds. '' I wonder if they are all quite dead,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been Ben Weatherstaff she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could have told whether the wood was alive by looking at it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could only see that there were only gray or brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even a tiny leaf-bud anywhere.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was inside the wonderful garden and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could come through the door under the ivy any time and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found a world all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own.
<p/>The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky over this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant and soft than it was over the moor.
<p/>'' Is it all a quite dead garden? I wish it wasn't. '' The robin flew down from his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) tree-top and hopped about or flew after her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) from one bush to another.
<p/>Everything was strange and silent and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seemed to be hundreds of miles away from any one, but somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not feel lonely at all.
<p/>All that troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew whether all the roses were dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put out leaves and buds as the weather got warmer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) chirped a good deal and had a very busy air, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) were showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not want it to be a quite dead garden.
<p/>If it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful it would be, and what thousands of roses would grow on every side!
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) skipping-rope had hung over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arm when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came in and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had walked about for a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would skip round the whole garden, stopping when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to look at things.
<p/>There seemed to have been grass paths here and there, and in one or two corners there were alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall moss-covered flower urns in them.
<p/>There had once been a flowerbed in it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw something sticking out of the black earth--some sharp little pale green points.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came near the second of these alcoves she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped skipping. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knelt down to look at them.
<p/>'' Yes, they are tiny growing things and they might be crocuses or snowdrops or daffodils,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whispered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the damp earth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked it very much. '' Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' I will go all over the garden and look.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked in the old border beds and among the grass, and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had gone round, trying to miss nothing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found ever so many more sharp, pale green points, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had become quite excited again.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not skip, but walked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went slowly and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes on the ground. '' It isn't a quite dead garden,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried out softly to herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so thick in some of the places where the green points were pushing their way through that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought they did not seem to have room enough to grow.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) searched about until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found a rather sharp piece of wood and knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made nice little clear places around them.
<p/>'' Even if the roses are dead, there are other things alive. '' '' Now they look as if they could breathe,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had finished with the first ones.
<p/>'' I am going to do ever so many more. I'll do all I can see. If I haven't time today I can come tomorrow.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went from place to place, and dug and weeded, and enjoyed herself so immensely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was led on from bed to bed and into the grass under the trees.
<p/>The exercise made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) so warm that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) first threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) coat off, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hat, and without knowing it she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was smiling down on to the grass and the pale green points all the time.
<p/>'' The robin was tremendously busy. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was very much pleased to see gardening begun on his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) own estate. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had often wondered at Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>Now here was this new kind of creature who was not half Ben's size and yet had had the sense to come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) garden and begin at once.
<p/>Where gardening is done all sorts of delightful things to eat are turned up with the soil. Mistress Mary worked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) garden until it was time to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) midday dinner.
<p/>In fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was rather late in remembering, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) coat and hat, and picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) skipping-rope, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been working two or three hours.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been actually happy all the time; and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale green points were to be seen in cleared places, looking twice as cheerful as they had looked before when the grass and weeds had been smothering them.
<p/>I shall come back this afternoon,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, looking all round at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) new kingdom, and speaking to the trees and the rose-bushes as if they heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>'' Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran lightly across the grass, pushed open the slow old door and slipped through it under the ivy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had such red cheeks and such bright eyes and ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted. '' Two pieces o
<p/>' meat an' two helps o' rice puddin'! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. '' Eh! mother will be pleased when I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) what th' skippin'-rope's done for thee.
<p/>In the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) digging with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pointed stick Mistress Mary had found herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it and just now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered if Martha could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) what it was.
<p/>'' '' Martha,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``what are those white roots that look like onions?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' They're bulbs,'' answered Martha. '' Lots o' spring flowers grow from 'em.
<p/>Th' very little ones are snowdrops an' crocuses an' th' big ones are narcissuses an' jonquils and daffydowndillys. Th' biggest of all is lilies an' purple flags.
<p/>Eh! they are nice. Dickon's got a whole lot of 'em planted in our bit o' garden. '' <div class="bookquote">``Does Dickon know all about them?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary, a new idea taking possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk.
<p/>Mother says he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickon</b></font>) just whispers things out o' th' ground. '' <div class="bookquote">``Do bulbs live a long time? Would they live years and years if no one helped them?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>inquired Mary anxiously. '' They're things as helps themselves,'' said Martha. '' That's why poor folk can afford to have 'em.
<p/>If you don't trouble 'em, most of 'em'll work away underground for a lifetime an' spread out an' have little `uns.
<p/>There's a place in th' park woods here where there's snowdrops by thousands. They're the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th' spring comes.
<p/>No one knows when they was first planted.'' <div class="bookquote">``I wish the spring was here now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' I want to see all the things that grow in England.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dinner and gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) favorite seat on the hearth-rug. '' I wish--I wish I had a little spade,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Whatever does tha' want a spade for? '' asked Martha, laughing. '' Art tha' goin' to take to diggin'? I must tell mother that, too.
<p/>'' Mary looked at the fire and pondered a little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must be careful if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) meant to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) secret kingdom.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wasn't doing any harm, but if Mr. Craven found out about the open door he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) would be fearfully angry and get a new key and lock it up forevermore.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) really could not bear that. '' This is such a big lonely place,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said slowly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were turning matters over in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind.
<p/>'' The house is lonely, and the park is lonely, and the gardens are lonely. So many places seem shut up.
<p/>I never did many things in India, but there were more people to look at--natives and soldiers marching by--and sometimes bands playing, and my Ayah told me stories.
<p/>There is no one to talk to here except you and Ben Weatherstaff. And you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff won't speak to me often.
<p/>I thought if I had a little spade I could dig somewhere as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) does, and I might make a little garden if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) would give me some seeds.
<p/>'' Martha's face quite lighted up. '' There now! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``if that wasn't one of th' things mother said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says, `There's such a lot o' room in that big place, why don't they give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a bit for herself, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesn't plant nothin' but parsley an' radishes?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d dig an' rake away an' be right down happy over it.' Them was the very words she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Were they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/>It's like she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) says: 'A woman as brings up twelve children learns something besides her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) A B C. Children's as good as `rithmetic to set you findin' out things.'
<p/>'' How many things she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knows, doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``Eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``How much would a spade cost--a little one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary asked. '' Well,'' was Martha's reflective answer, <div class="bookquote">``at Thwaite village there's a shop or so an' I saw little garden sets with a spade an' a rake an' a fork all tied together for two shillings.
<p/>An' they was stout enough to work with, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've got more than that in my purse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' Mrs. Morrison gave me five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr. Craven.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) remember thee that much? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Martha. '' Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend.

<p/>Tha' can buy anything in th' world tha' wants. Th' rent of our cottage is only one an' threepence an' it's like pullin' eye-teeth to get it.
<p/>In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o' flower-seeds for a penny each, and our Dickon he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knows which is th' prettiest ones an' how to make 'em grow.
<p/>Now I've just thought of somethin','' putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) hips. <div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary eagerly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) walks over to Thwaite many a day just for th' fun of it.
<p/>Does tha' know how to print letters?'' suddenly. '' I know how to write,'' Mary answered. Martha shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) head. ''
<p/>Our Dickon can only read printin'. If tha' could print we could write a letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) an' ask him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to go an' buy th' garden tools
<p/>an' th' seeds at th' same time. '' '' Oh! you're a good girl!'' Mary cried. '' You are, really! I didn't know you were so nice.
<p/>I know I can print letters if I try. Let's ask Mrs. Medlock for a pen and ink and some paper.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got some of my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha. '' I bought 'em so I could print a bit of a letter to mother of a Sunday.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ran out of the room, and Mary stood by the fire and twisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thin little hands together with sheer pleasure.
<p/>I'll go and get it. '' '' If I have a spade,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``I can make the earth nice and soft and dig up weeds.
<p/>If I have seeds and can make flowers grow the garden won't be dead at all--it will come alive. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha returned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) pen and ink and paper
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was obliged to clear the table and carry the plates and dishes downstairs and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) got into the kitchen
<p/>Mrs. Medlock was there and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) to do something, so Mary waited for what seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a long time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came back.
<p/>Then it was a serious piece of work to write to Dickon. Mary had been taught very little because her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) governesses had disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) too much to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not spell particularly well but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could print letters when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tried. This was the letter Martha dictated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>):
<p/>Miss Mary has plenty of money and will you go to Thwaite and buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) some flower seeds and a set of garden tools to make a flower-bed.
<p/>Pick the prettiest ones and easy to grow because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has never done it before and lived in India which is different.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Dear Dickon: This comes hoping to find you well as it leaves me at present. Give my love to mother and every one of you.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>)'ll like to walk over this way.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''

<p/>I want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) very much. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Martha gave a little start, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) remembered something. '' I asked mother--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>)'d ask Mrs. Medlock her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) own self.''
<p/>Ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) if you might be driven over to our cottage some day and have a bit o' mother's hot oat cake, an' butter, an' a glass o' milk.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary began. '' What I said Tuesday. '' It seemed as if all the interesting things were happening in one day.
<p/>To think of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue! To think of going into the cottage which held twelve children!
<p/>'' Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) think Mrs. Medlock would let me go? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) asked, quite anxiously. '' Aye, she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) would.
<p/>If I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon,'' said Mary, thinking it over and liking the idea very much.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knows what a tidy woman mother is and how clean she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) keeps the cottage. '' '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) doesn't seem to be like the mothers in India.
<p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon ended by making her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feel quiet and thoughtful. Martha stayed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) until tea-time, but they sat in comfortable quiet and talked very little.
<p/>But just before Martha went downstairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked a question. '' Martha,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``has the scullery-maid had the toothache again today?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Martha certainly started slightly. '' What makes thee ask that? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. '' Because when I waited so long for you to come back
<p/>I opened the door and walked down the corridor to see if you were coming. And I heard that far-off crying again, just as we heard it the other night.
<p/>There isn't a wind today, so you see it couldn't have been the wind. '' <div class="bookquote">``Eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha restlessly. '' Tha' mustn't go walkin' about in corridors an' listenin'.
<p/>Mr. Craven would be that there angry there's no knowin' what he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'d do.'' <div class="bookquote">``I wasn't listening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' I was just waiting for you--and I heard it.
<p/>It's the strangest house any one ever lived in,'' said Mary drowsily, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>That's three times.'' <div class="bookquote">``My word! There's Mrs. Medlock's bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) almost ran out of the room. '' Fresh air, and digging, and skipping-rope had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) feel so comfortably tired that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) fell asleep.
<p/>CHAPTER X DICKON The sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden. The Secret Garden was what Mary called it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was thinking of it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked the name, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in no one knew where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was.
<p/>The few books she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had read and liked had been fairy-story books, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had read of secret gardens in some of the stories.
<p/>It seemed almost like being shut out of the world in some fairy place. Sometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred years, which she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had thought must be rather stupid.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was becoming wider awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was beginning to like to be out of doors; she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed it. She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) could run faster, and longer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) could skip up to a hundred.
<p/>Such nice clear places were made round them that they had all the breathing space they wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it, they began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously.
<p/>The sun could get at them and warm them, and when the rain came down it could reach them at once, so they began to feel very much alive.
<p/>Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had something interesting to be determined about, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was very much absorbed, indeed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) work every hour instead of tiring of it.
<p/>The bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) like a fascinating sort of play.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found many more of the sprouting pale green points than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had ever hoped to find. They seemed to be starting up everywhere and
<p/>There were so many that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remembered what Martha had said about the <div class="bookquote">``snowdrops by the thousands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>and about bulbs spreading and making new ones.
<p/>each day she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) found tiny new ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth. These had been left to themselves for ten years
<p/>and perhaps they had spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers.
<p/>Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom.
<p/>During that week of sunshine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) became more intimate with Ben Weatherstaff. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) several times by seeming to start up beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) sprang out of the earth.
<p/>The truth was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) would pick up his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) tools and go away if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) coming, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) always walked toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) as silently as possible.
<p/>But, in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did not object to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) as strongly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had at first. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was secretly rather flattered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) evident desire for his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) elderly company.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did not know that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) would have spoken to a native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) masters, and be merely commanded by them to do things.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha`rt like th' robin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) one morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) head and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>).
<p/>Then, also, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was more civil than she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had been. '' I never knows when I shall see thee or which side tha'll come from.''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s friends with me now,'' said Mary. '' That's like him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>),'' snapped Ben Weatherstaff. '' Makin' up to th' women folk just for vanity an' flightiness.
<p/>There's nothin' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) wouldn't do for th' sake o' showin' off an' flirtin' his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) tail-feathers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s as full o' pride as an egg's full o' meat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer Mary's questions except by a grunt, but this morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said more than usual.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) stood up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) spade while he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) over. ''
<p/>How long has tha' been here? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) jerked out. '' I think it's about a month,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered. '' Tha's beginnin' to do Misselthwaite credit,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Tha's a bit fatter than tha' was an' tha's not quite so yeller. Tha' looked like a young plucked crow when tha' first came into this garden.
<p/>Thinks I to myself I never set eyes on an uglier, sourer faced young `un. '' Mary was not vain and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never thought much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looks she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not greatly disturbed.
<p/>'' I know I'm fatter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' My stockings are getting tighter. They used to make wrinkles. There's the robin, Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) flirted his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) wings and tail and tilted his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) head and hopped about with all sorts of lively graces.
<p/>'' There, indeed, was the robin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) looked nicer than ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/>But Ben was sarcastic. '' Aye, there tha' art! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) said. '' Tha' can put up with me for a bit sometimes when tha's got no one better.
<p/>Tha's courtin' some bold young madam somewhere tellin' thy lies to her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) about bein' th' finest cock robin on Missel Moor an' ready to fight all th' rest of 'em.
<p/>Tha's been reddenin' up thy waistcoat an' polishin' thy feathers this two weeks. I know what tha's up to. '' <div class="bookquote">``Oh! look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mary.
<p/>The robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) hopped closer and closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff more and more engagingly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) flew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) head and sang a little song right at him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>). ''
<p/>Tha' thinks tha'll get over me by doin' that,'' said Ben, wrinkling his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) face up in such a way that Mary felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was trying not to look pleased.
<p/>'' Tha' thinks no one can stand out against thee--that's what tha' thinks. '' The robin spread his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wings--Mary could scarcely believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) flew right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff's spade and alighted on the top of it. Then the old man's face wrinkled itself slowly into a new expression.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood still as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were afraid to breathe--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not have stirred for the world, lest his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) robin should start away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke quite in a whisper. '' Well, I'm danged!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said as softly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were saying something quite different.
<p/>'' Tha' does know how to get at a chap--tha' does! Tha's fair unearthly, tha's so knowin'. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) stood without stirring--almost without drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) breath--until the robin gave another flirt to his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wings and flew away.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stood looking at the handle of the spade as if there might be Magic in it, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes.
<p/>But because he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) kept breaking into a slow grin now and then, Mary was not afraid to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>). ''
<p/>Have you a garden of your own? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked. '' No. I'm bachelder an' lodge with Martin at th' gate.''
<p/>'' If you had one,'' said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``what would you plant?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cabbages an' `taters an' onions.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>'' But if you wanted to make a flower garden,'' persisted Mary, <div class="bookquote">``what would you plant?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bulbs an' sweet-smellin' things--but mostly roses. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary's face lighted up. '' Do you like roses? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. Ben Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'' Well, yes, I do. I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a lot in a place she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was fond of, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loved 'em like they was children--or robins.
<p/>I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bend over an' kiss 'em. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) dragged out another weed and scowled at it. '' That were as much as ten year' ago.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) now? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary, much interested. '' Heaven,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) answered, and drove his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) spade deep into the soil, ''`cording to what parson says.''
<p/>'' What happened to the roses? '' Mary asked again, more interested than ever. '' They was left to themselves. ''
<p/>Mary was becoming quite excited. '' Did they quite die? Do roses quite die when they are left to themselves? ''
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ventured. '' Well, I'd got to like 'em-- an' I liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)-- an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked 'em,'' Ben Weatherstaff admitted reluctantly.
<p/>'' Once or twice a year I'd go an' work at 'em a bit--prune 'em an' dig about th' roots. They run wild, but they was in rich soil, so some of 'em lived.
<p/>When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?
<p/>Wait till th' spring gets at 'em--wait till th' sun shines on th' rain and th' rain falls on th' sunshine an' then tha'll find out.
<p/>'' '' '' inquired Mary. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``How--how? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>cried Mary, forgetting to be careful. '' Look along th' twigs an' branches an' if tha' see a bit of a brown lump swelling here
<p/>an' there, watch it after th' warm rain an' see what happens. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eager face.
<p/>'' Why does tha' care so much about roses an' such, all of a sudden? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) demanded. Mistress Mary felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face grow red.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was almost afraid to answer. '' I--I want to play that--that I have a garden of my own,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stammered.
<p/>'' I--there is nothing for me to do. I have nothing--and no one.'' '' Well,'' said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that's true.
<p/>Tha' hasn't. ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was actually a little sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never felt sorry for herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had only felt tired and cross, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) disliked people and things so much.
<p/>But now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer. If no one found out about the secret garden, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should enjoy herself always.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) answered every one of them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) queer grunting way and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did not seem really cross and did not pick up his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) spade and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said something about roses just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was going away and it reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) of the ones he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had been fond of.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stayed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) as many questions as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dared. '' Do you go and see those other roses now?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) seemed to get angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not see why he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) should.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked. '' Not been this year. My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th' joints. '' '' Now look here!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said sharply.
<p/>'' Don't tha' ask so many questions. Tha`rt th' worst wench for askin' questions I've ever come a cross. Get thee gone an' play thee.
<p/>I've done talkin' for today. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said it so crossly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew there was not the least use in staying another minute.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went skipping slowly down the outside walk, thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here was another person whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) crossness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked old Ben Weatherstaff. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did like him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) always wanted to try to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and ended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits hopping about.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) enjoyed the skipping very much and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reached the little gate she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened it and went through because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it was.
<p/>Also she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) knew everything in the world about flowers. It was a very strange thing indeed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) quite caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back against it, playing on a rough wooden pipe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked very clean and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nose turned up and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round and such blue eyes in any boy's face.
<p/>And on the trunk of the tree he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) neck to peep out, and quite near him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses--and actually it appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and listen to the strange low little call
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw Mary he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in a voice almost as low as and rather like his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) piping.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a funny looking boy about twelve. his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pipe seemed to make. '' Don't tha' move,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. '' It'd flight 'em.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were moving at all, but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feet and then the squirrel scampered back up into the branches of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tree, the pheasant withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away, though not at all as if they were frightened.
<p/>'' Mary remained motionless. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stopped playing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pipe and began to rise from the ground. '' I'm Dickon,'' the boy said.
<p/>'' I know tha`rt Miss Mary. '' Then Mary realized that somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had known at first that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was Dickon.
<p/>Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the natives charm snakes in India? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a wide, red, curving mouth and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) smile spread all over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' I got up slow,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``because if tha' makes a quick move it startles 'em. A body `as to move gentle an' speak low when wild things is about.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as if they had never seen each other before but as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) quite well.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mary knew nothing about boys and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a little stiffly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt rather shy. '' Did you get Martha's letter?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) curly, rust-colored head. '' That's why I come. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground beside him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) piped.
<p/>'' I've got th' garden tools. There's a little spade an' rake an' a fork an' hoe. Eh! they are good `uns.
<p/>An' th' woman in th' shop threw in a packet o' white poppy an' one o' blue larkspur when I bought th' other seeds.
<p/>There's a trowel, too. '' <div class="bookquote">``Will you show the seeds to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could talk as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did.
<p/>It sounded as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and was not the least afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not like him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes and with a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were made of them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked it very much and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) funny face with the red cheeks and round blue eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt shy.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) speech was so quick and easy. <div class="bookquote">``Let us sit down on this log and look at them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. They sat down and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took a clumsy little brown paper package out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) coat pocket.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) untied the string and inside there were ever so many neater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each one.
<p/>'' There's a lot o' mignonette an' poppies,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. '' Mignonette's th' sweetest smellin' thing as grows, an' it'll grow wherever you cast it, same as poppies will.
<p/>Them as'll come up an' bloom if you just whistle to 'em, them's th' nicest of all. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stopped and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head quickly, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) poppy-cheeked face lighting up.
<p/>'' Where's that robin as is callin' us?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. The chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet berries, and Mary thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew whose it was.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s callin' some one he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s friends with.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>Is it really calling us? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked. That's same as sayin' `Here I am. Look at me. I wants a bit of a chat.'
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is in the bush. Whose is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s Ben Weatherstaff's, but I think he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knows me a little,'' answered Mary.
<p/>'' Aye, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knows thee,'' said Dickon in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) low voice again. '' An' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) likes thee. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s took thee on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Mary had noticed before, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made a sound almost like the robin's own twitter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll tell me all about thee in a minute. '' The robin listened a few seconds, intently, and then answered quite as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) were replying to a question.
<p/>'' Aye, he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s a friend o' yours,'' chuckled Dickon. '' Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) is?'' cried Mary eagerly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did so want to know.
<p/>'' Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) really likes me?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wouldn't come near thee if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) didn't,'' answered Dickon. '' Birds is rare choosers an' a robin can flout a body worse than a man.
<p/>See, he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s making up to thee now. ' Cannot tha' see a chap?' he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s sayin'. '' And it really seemed as if it must be true.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) so sidled and twittered and tilted as he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hopped on his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) bush. '' Do you understand everything birds say?'' said Mary.
<p/>Dickon's grin spread until he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) seemed all wide, red, curving mouth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) rough head. '' I think I do, and they think I do,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I've lived on th' moor with 'em so long. I've watched 'em break shell an' come out an' fledge an' learn to fly an' begin to sing,
<p/>Sometimes I think p`raps I'm a bird, or a fox, or a rabbit, or a squirrel, or even a beetle, an' I don't know it.
<p/>till I think I'm one of 'em. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flower seeds again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>) what they looked like when they were flowers; he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>) how to plant them, and watch them, and feed and water them.
<p/>'' See here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) said suddenly, turning round to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>). '' I'll plant them for thee myself. Where is tha' garden?
<p/>'' Mary's thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lap. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know what to say, so for a whole minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said nothing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never thought of this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt miserable. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went red and then pale. ''
<p/>Tha's got a bit o' garden, hasn't tha'? '' Dickon said. It was true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had turned red and then pale.
<p/>Dickon saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) do it, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) still said nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) began to be puzzled. '' Wouldn't they give thee a bit?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) asked. '' Hasn't tha' got any yet? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands tighter and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes toward him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>).
<p/>'' I don't know anything about boys,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said slowly. '' Could you keep a secret, if I told you one?
<p/>It's a great secret. I don't know what I should do if any one found it out. I believe I should die!
<p/>Dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) rough head again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) answered quite good-humoredly.
<p/>If I couldn't keep secrets from th' other lads, secrets about foxes' cubs, an' birds' nests, an' wild things' holes, there'd be naught safe on th' moor.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said the last sentence quite fiercely. '' I'm keepin' secrets all th' time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) said. '' Aye, I can keep secrets.
<p/>'' Mistress Mary did not mean to put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand and clutch his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) sleeve but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did it. '' I've stolen a garden,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said very fast.
<p/>'' It isn't mine. It isn't anybody's. Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it, nobody ever goes into it. Perhaps everything is dead in it already.
<p/>I don't know. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to feel hot and as contrary as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had ever felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life. ''
<p/>I don't care, I don't care! Nobody has any right to take it from me when I care about it and they don't.
<p/>They're letting it die, all shut in by itself,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ended passionately, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arms over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face and burst out crying-poor little Mistress Mary.
<p/>Dickon's curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder. '' Eh-h-h!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) exclamation out slowly, and the way he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did it meant both wonder and sympathy.
<p/>'' I've nothing to do,'' said Mary. '' Nothing belongs to me. I found it myself and I got into it myself.
<p/>I was only just like the robin, and they wouldn't take it from the robin. '' <div class="bookquote">``Where is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>asked Dickon in a dropped voice.
<p/>Mistress Mary got up from the log at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt contrary again, and obstinate, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not care at all.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was imperious and Indian, and at the same time hot and sorrowful. <div class="bookquote">``Come with me and I'll show you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so thickly. Dickon followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with a queer, almost pitying, look on his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) were being led to look at some strange bird's nest and must move softly. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stepped to the wall and lifted the hanging ivy he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) started.
<p/>There was a door and Mary pushed it slowly open and they passed in together, and then Mary stood and waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand round defiantly.
<p/>'' It's this,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' It's a secret garden, and I'm the only one in the world who wants it to be alive.
<p/>'' Dickon looked round and round about it, and round and round again. '' Eh! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) almost whispered, <div class="bookquote">``it is a queer, pretty place!
<p/>For two or three minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stood looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), while Mary watched him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) began to walk about softly, even more lightly than Mary had walked the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found herself inside the four walls.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) eyes seemed to be taking in everything--the gray trees with the gray creepers climbing over them and hanging from their branches, the tangle on the walls and among the grass, the evergreen alcoves with the stone seats and tall flower urns standing in them.
<p/>It's like as if a body was in a dream. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XI THE NEST OF THE MISSEL THRUSH '' I never thought I'd see this place,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said at last, in a whisper.
<p/>'' Did you know about it?'' asked Mary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had spoken aloud and he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) made a sign to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' We must talk low,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or some one'll hear us an' wonder what's to do in here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh! I forgot!'' said Mary, feeling frightened and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand quickly against her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mouth. '' Did you know about the garden?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked again when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had recovered herself. Dickon nodded. '' Martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'' Us used to wonder what it was like. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) round eyes looked queerly happy.
<p/>'' Eh! the nests as'll be here come springtime,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said. '' It'd be th' safest nestin' place in England. No one never comin' near an' tangles o' trees an' roses to build in.
<p/>I wonder all th' birds on th' moor don't build here. '' Mistress Mary put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) arm again without knowing it.
<p/>'' Will there be roses? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whispered. '' Can you tell? I thought perhaps they were all dead. '' <div class="bookquote">``Eh!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stepped over to the nearest tree--an old, old one with gray lichen all over its bark, but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays and branches.
<p/>No! Not them--not all of 'em!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Look here!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) took a thick knife out of his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) Pocket and opened one of its blades.
<p/>'' There's lots o' dead wood as ought to be cut out,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said. '' An' there's a lot o' old wood, but it made some new last year.
<p/>This here's a new bit,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) touched a shoot which looked brownish green instead of hard, dry gray. Mary touched it herself in an eager, reverent way.
<p/>'' That one? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' Is that one quite alive quite? '' Dickon curved his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wide smiling mouth. ''
<p/>It's as wick as you or me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said; and Mary remembered that Martha had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that <div class="bookquote">``wick''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>meant <div class="bookquote">``alive''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``lively.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I'm glad it's wick! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whisper. '' I want them all to be wick. Let us go round the garden and count how many wick ones there are.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) quite panted with eagerness, and Dickon was as eager as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was. They went from tree to tree and from bush to bush.
<p/>Dickon carried his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) hand and showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) things which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought wonderful.

<p/>The delicatest ones has died out, but th' others has growed an' growed, an' spread an' spread, till they's a wonder.
<p/>See here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) pulled down a thick gray, dry-looking branch. '' A body might think this was dead wood, but I don't believe it is--down to th' root.
<p/>I'll cut it low down an' see. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) knelt and with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) knife cut the lifeless-looking branch through, not far above the earth.
<p/>'' There!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said exultantly. '' I told thee so. There's green in that wood yet. Look at it. '' Mary was down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knees before he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) spoke, gazing with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might.
<p/>'' When it looks a bit greenish an' juicy like that, it's wick,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) explained. '' When th' inside is dry an' breaks easy, like this here piece I've cut off, it's done for.
<p/>an' if th' old wood's cut off an' it's dug round, and took care of there'll be--'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stopped and lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) face to look up at the climbing and hanging sprays above him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``there'll be a fountain o' roses here this summer.
<p/>There's a big root here as all this live wood sprung out of, ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>They went from bush to bush and from tree to tree.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was very strong and clever with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood away, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green life in it.
<p/>In the course of half an hour Mary thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could tell too, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) cut through a lifeless-looking branch she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would cry out joyfully under her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) caught sight of the least shade of moist green.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) how to use the fork while he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) dug about roots with the spade and stirred the earth and let the air in.
<p/>They were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) caught sight of something which made him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) utter an exclamation of surprise.
<p/>The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful. <div class="bookquote">``Why!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. ''
<p/>Who did that there? '' It was one of Mary's own little clearings round the pale green points. '' I did it,'' said Mary.
<p/>I don't,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``but they were so little, and the grass was so thick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Why, I thought tha' didn't know nothin' about gardenin','' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) exclaimed. '' So I made a place for them. I don't even know what they are.
<p/>'' Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) wide smile. '' Tha' was right,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said. '' A gardener couldn't have told thee better.
<p/>They'll grow now like Jack's bean-stalk. They're crocuses an' snowdrops, an' these here is narcissuses,'' turning to another patch, <div class="bookquote">``an here's daffydowndillys.
<p/>Eh! they will be a sight. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ran from one clearing to another. '' Tha' has done a lot o' work for such a little wench,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, looking her (<font color='blue'><b>Eh</b></font>) over.
<p/>'' I'm growing fatter,'' said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``and I'm growing stronger. I used always to be tired. When I dig I'm not tired at all.
<p/>I like to smell the earth when it's turned up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>'' It's rare good for thee,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) head wisely.
<p/>There's naught as nice as th' smell o' good clean earth, except th' smell o' fresh growin' things when th' rain falls on 'em.
<p/>'' I get out on th' moor many a day when it's rainin' an ' I lie under a bush an' listen to th' soft swish o' drops on th' heather
<p/>an' I just sniff an' sniff. My nose end fair quivers like a rabbit's, mother says. '' <div class="bookquote">``Do you never catch cold?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>inquired Mary, gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wonderingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never seen such a funny boy, or such a nice one. ''
<p/>Not me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, grinning. '' I never ketched cold since I was born. I wasn't brought up nesh enough. I've chased about th' moor in all weathers same as th' rabbits does.
<p/>Mother says I've sniffed up too much fresh air for twelve year' to ever get to sniffin' with cold. I'm as tough as a white-thorn knobstick.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was working all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was talking and Mary was following him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and helping him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fork or the trowel.
<p/>'' '' There's a lot of work to do here! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said once, looking about quite exultantly. '' Will you come again and help me to do it?''
<p/>Mary begged. '' I'm sure I can help, too. I can dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell me.
<p/>Oh! do come, Dickon!'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll come every day if tha' wants me, rain or shine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answered stoutly. '' It's the best fun I ever had in my life--shut in here an' wakenin' up a garden.''
<p/>'' If you will come,'' said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``if you will help me to make it alive I'll --I don't know what I'll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ended helplessly.
<p/>What could you do for a boy like that? '' I'll tell thee what tha'll do,'' said Dickon, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) happy grin.
<p/>'' Tha'll get fat an' tha'll get as hungry as a young fox an' tha'll learn how to talk to th' robin same as I do.
<p/>Eh! we'll have a lot o' fun. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) began to walk about, looking up in the trees and at the walls and bushes with a thoughtful expression.
<p/>I wouldn't want to make it look like a gardener's garden, all clipped an' spick an' span, would you?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' '' It's nicer like this with things runnin' wild, an' swingin' an' catchin' hold of each other.'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't let us make it tidy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary anxiously.
<p/>'' It wouldn't seem like a secret garden if it was tidy. '' Dickon stood rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) rusty-red head with a rather puzzled look.
<p/>It's a secret garden sure enough,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but seems like some one besides th' robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year' ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' But the door was locked and the key was buried,'' said Mary. '' No one could get in.'' ''
<p/>That's true,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) answered. '' It's a queer place. Seems to me as if there'd been a bit o' prunin' done here an' there, later than ten year' ago.''
<p/>'' But how could it have been done?'' said Mary. He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) was examining a branch of a standard rose and he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) head.
<p/>Mistress Mary always felt that however many years she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lived she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should never forget that first morning when her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) garden began to grow.
<p/>'' Aye! how could it! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) murmured. '' With th' door locked an' th' key buried. '' Of course, it did seem to begin to grow for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that morning.
<p/>When Dickon began to clear places to plant seeds, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remembered what Basil had sung at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) wanted to tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>'' Are there any flowers that look like bells? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) inquired. '' Lilies o' th' valley does,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) answered, digging away with the trowel, <div class="bookquote">``an' there's Canterbury bells, an' campanulas.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's plant some,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' There's lilies o' th, valley here already; I saw 'em. They'll have growed too close an' we'll have to separate 'em, but there's plenty.
<p/>Th' other ones takes two years to bloom from seed, but I can bring you some bits o' plants from our cottage garden.
<p/>Then Mary told him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) about Basil and his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) brothers and sisters in India and of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had hated them and of their calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Mistress Mary Quite Contrary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Why does tha' want 'em?'' '' They used to dance round and sing at me. They sang-- `Mistress Mary, quite contrary
<p/>, How does your garden grow? With silver bells, and cockle shells, And marigolds all in a row.' I just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowers like silver bells.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) frowned a little and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) trowel a rather spiteful dig into the earth. '' I wasn't as contrary as they were.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) crumbled the rich black soil she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was sniffing up the scent of it.
<p/>There doesn't seem to be no need for no one to be contrary when there's flowers an' such like, an' such lots o' friendly wild things runnin' about makin' homes for themselves, or buildin' nests an' singin' an' whistlin', does there?
<p/>'' But Dickon laughed. '' Eh! '' '' Mary, kneeling by him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) holding the seeds, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and stopped frowning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dickon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you are as nice as Martha said you were. I like you, and you make the fifth person.
<p/>I never thought I should like five people. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Dickon sat up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heels as Martha did when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was polishing the grate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did look funny and delightful, Mary thought, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) round blue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose.
<p/>'' Only five folk as tha' likes? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' Who is th' other four?'' '' Your mother and Martha,'' Mary checked them off on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fingers, <div class="bookquote">``and the robin and Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Dickon laughed so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was obliged to stifle the sound by putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) arm over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) mouth. '' I know tha' thinks I'm a queer lad,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I think tha' art th' queerest little lass I ever saw. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then Mary did a strange thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) leaned forward and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) a question she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never dreamed of asking any one before.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tried to ask it in Yorkshire because that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) language, and in India a native was always pleased if you knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) speech.
<p/>'' Does tha' like me? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' Eh!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) answered heartily, <div class="bookquote">``that I does. I likes thee wonderful, an' so does th' robin, I do believe!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That's two, then,'' said Mary. '' That's two for me. '' And then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully.
<p/>Mary was startled and sorry when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard the big clock in the courtyard strike the hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) midday dinner.
<p/>'' I shall have to go,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said mournfully. '' And you will have to go too, won't you? '' Dickon grinned.
<p/>'' My dinner's easy to carry about with me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said. '' Mother always lets me put a bit o' somethin' in my pocket.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a lumpy little bundle tied up in a quite clean, coarse, blue and white handkerchief.
<p/>'' It held two thick pieces of bread with a slice of something laid between them. '' It's oftenest naught but bread,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but
<p/>I've got a fine slice o' fat bacon with it today. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mary thought it looked a queer dinner, but he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) seemed ready to enjoy it.
<p/>'' Run on an' get thy victuals,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said. '' I'll be done with mine first. I'll get some more work done before I start back home.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) sat down with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) back against a tree. '' I'll call th' robin up,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and give him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) th' rind o' th' bacon to peck at.
<p/>Suddenly it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) might be a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) came into the garden again.
<p/>They likes a bit o' fat wonderful. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mary could scarcely bear to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) seemed too good to be true.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went slowly half-way to the door in the wall and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stopped and went back. '' Whatever happens, you--you never would tell?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. His (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) first big bite of bread and bacon, but he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) managed to smile encouragingly.
<p/>'' If tha' was a missel thrush an' showed me where thy nest was, does tha' think I'd tell any one?
<p/>Not me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said. '' Tha' art as safe as a missel thrush. '' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was quite sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was.
<p/>CHAPTER XII <div class="bookquote">``MIGHT I HAVE A BIT OF EARTH? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary ran so fast that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was rather out of breath when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hair was ruffled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) forehead and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cheeks were bright pink. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dinner was waiting on the table, and Martha was waiting near it.
<p/>'' Tha's a bit late,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. '' Where has tha' been?'' '' I've seen Dickon!'' said Mary. '' I've seen Dickon!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha exultantly. '' How does tha' like him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``I think-- I think he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s beautiful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary in a determined voice.
<p/>Martha looked rather taken aback but she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) looked pleased, too. '' Well,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s th' best lad as ever was born, but us never thought he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was handsome.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) nose turns up too much.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I like it to turn up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' An' his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes is so round,'' said Martha, a trifle doubtful.
<p/>'' Though they're a nice color. '' <div class="bookquote">``I like them round,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' And they are exactly the color of the sky over the moor.
<p/>'' Martha beamed with satisfaction. '' Mother says he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) made 'em that color with always lookin' up at th' birds an' th' clouds.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has got a big mouth, hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), now?'' <div class="bookquote">``I love his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) big mouth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary obstinately. '' I wish mine were just like it.
<p/>'' Martha chuckled delightedly. '' It'd look rare an' funny in thy bit of a face,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. '' But I knowed it would be that way when tha' saw him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>How did tha' like th' seeds an' th' garden tools? '' <div class="bookquote">``How did you know he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brought them? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary.
<p/>'' Eh! I never thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) not bringin' 'em. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d be sure to bring 'em if they was in Yorkshire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s such a trusty lad. '' Mary was afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might begin to ask difficult questions, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was very much interested in the seeds and gardening tools, and there was only one moment when Mary was frightened.
<p/>This was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to ask where the flowers were to be planted. '' Who did tha' ask about it?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) inquired. '' I haven't asked anybody yet,'' said Mary, hesitating. '' Well, I wouldn't ask th' head gardener. He (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>)'s too grand, Mr. Roach is.
<p/>'' '' I've never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>),'' said Mary. '' I've only seen undergardeners and Ben Weatherstaff.'' '' If I was you, I'd ask Ben Weatherstaff,'' advised Martha.
<p/>Mr. Craven lets him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) likes because he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was here when Mrs. Craven was alive, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) used to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) laugh.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s not half as bad as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) looks, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s so crabbed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>). Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'d find you a corner somewhere out
<p/>If it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one could mind my having it, could they?''
<p/>o' the way.'' '' Mary said anxiously. '' There wouldn't be no reason,'' answered Martha. '' You wouldn't do no harm.
<p/>Mary ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dinner as quickly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) rose from the table she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was going to run to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hat again, but Martha stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>'' '' I've got somethin' to tell you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. '' I thought I'd let you eat your dinner first. Mr. Craven came back this mornin' and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wants to see you.
<p/>'' Mary turned quite pale. '' Oh!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' Why! Why! He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) didn't want to see me when I came.
<p/>I heard Pitcher say he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) didn't. '' '' Well,'' explained Martha, <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Medlock says it's because o' mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was walkin' to Thwaite village

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>)'d forgot, but mother hadn't an' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made bold to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>).

<p/>but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said somethin' as put him (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) in th' mind to see you before he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) goes away again, tomorrow.

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) did not come back until winter, or even autumn, there would be time to watch the secret garden come alive.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>)'s always doin' it.'' '' Oh! I'm so glad--so glad!'' said Mary thankfully. Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) found out then and took it away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have had that much at least.
<p/>When do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) will want to see--'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not finish the sentence, because the door opened, and Mrs. Medlock walked in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) had on her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) best black dress and cap, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) collar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a man's face on it.
<p/>It was a colored photograph of Mr. Medlock who had died years ago, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) always wore it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was dressed up.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) looked nervous and excited. '' Your hair's rough,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said quickly. '' Go and brush it. Martha, help her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) to slip on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) best dress.
<p/>Mr. Craven sent me to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) study. '' All the pink left Mary's cheeks. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart began to thump and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt herself changing into a stiff, plain, silent child again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said nothing while her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dress was changed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hair brushed, and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was quite tidy she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) followed Mrs. Medlock down the corridors, in silence.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did not even answer Mrs. Medlock, but turned and walked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) bedroom, followed by Martha. What was there for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) to say?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was obliged to go and see Mr. Craven and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) would not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) would not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) would think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was taken to a part of the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had not been into before.
<p/>At last Mrs. Medlock knocked at a door, and when some one said, <div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>they entered the room together. A man was sitting in an armchair before the fire, and Mrs. Medlock spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' This is Miss Mary, sir,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' You can go and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) here. I will ring for you when I want you to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) away,'' said Mr. Craven.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went out and closed the door, Mary could only stand waiting, a plain little thing, twisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thin hands together.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see that the man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high, rather crooked shoulders, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had black hair streaked with white.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) high shoulders and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Come here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. Mary went to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not ugly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked as if the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) worried and fretted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know what in the world to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face would have been handsome if it had not been so miserable. '' Are you well? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked. ''
<p/>Yes,'' answered Mary. '' Do they take good care of you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead fretfully as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) over.
<p/>'' You are very thin,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. '' I am getting fatter,'' Mary answered in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stiffest way.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) black eyes seemed as if they scarcely saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), as if they were seeing something else, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hardly keep his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>What an unhappy face he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had! '' I forgot you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. '' How could I remember you? I intended to send you a governess or a nurse, or some one of that sort, but I forgot.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>began Mary. <div class="bookquote">``Please--''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and then the lump in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) throat choked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' What do you want to say?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inquired. '' I am--I am too big for a nurse,'' said Mary. '' And please--please don't make me have a governess yet.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead again and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' That was what the Sowerby woman said,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered absentmindedly.
<p/>Then Mary gathered a scrap of courage. '' Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)--is she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Martha's mother? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stammered. '' Yes, I think so,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knows about children,'' said Mary. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has twelve. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knows. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to rouse himself. '' What do you want to do?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to play out of doors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary answered, hoping that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) voice did not tremble. '' I never liked it in India.
<p/>It makes me hungry here, and I am getting fatter. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' Mrs. Sowerby said it would do you good.
<p/>Perhaps it will,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) thought you had better get stronger before you had a governess.'' <div class="bookquote">``It makes me feel strong when I play and the wind comes over the moor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>argued Mary.
<p/>'' Where do you play? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked next. '' Everywhere,'' gasped Mary. '' Martha's mother sent me a skipping-rope. I skip and run--and I look about to see if things are beginning to stick up out of the earth.
<p/>I don't do any harm. '' <div class="bookquote">``Don't look so frightened,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said in a worried voice. '' You could not do any harm, a child like you!
<p/>Mary put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) throat because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might see the excited lump which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt jump into it.
<p/>You may do what you like. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came a step nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' May I? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said tremulously.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) anxious little face seemed to worry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more than ever. '' Don't look so frightened,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exclaimed. '' Of course you may.
<p/>I am your guardian, though I am a poor one for any child. I cannot give you time or attention. I am too ill, and wretched and distracted; but I wish you to be happy and comfortable.
<p/>I don't know anything about children, but Mrs. Medlock is to see that you have all you need. I sent for you to-day because Mrs. Sowerby said I ought to see you.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) daughter had talked about you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) thought you needed fresh air and freedom and running about.'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) knows all about children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary said again in spite of herself.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ought to,'' said Mr. Craven. '' I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) rather bold to stop me on the moor, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said--Mrs.
<p/>Craven had been kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>). '' It seemed hard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) to speak his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) dead wife's name. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is a respectable woman.
<p/>Now I have seen you I think she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said sensible things. Play out of doors as much as you like. It's a big place and you may go where you like and amuse yourself as you like.
<p/>Is there anything you want? '' as if a sudden thought had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>). '' Do you want toys, books, dolls?''
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eagerness she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not realize how queer the words would sound and that they were not the ones she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had meant to say.
<p/>'' Might I ,'' quavered Mary, <div class="bookquote">``might I have a bit of earth? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mr. Craven looked quite startled. <div class="bookquote">``Earth!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) repeated.
<p/>'' What do you mean?'' '' To plant seeds in--to make things grow--to see them come alive,'' Mary faltered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a moment and then passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hand quickly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' Do you--care about gardens so much,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said slowly. '' I didn't know about them in India,'' said Mary. ''
<p/>I was always ill and tired and it was too hot. I sometimes made little beds in the sand and stuck flowers in them.
<p/>But here it is different. '' Mr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room. '' A bit of earth,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said to himself, and Mary thought that somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must have reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) of something.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) stopped and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) dark eyes looked almost soft and kind. '' You can have as much earth as you want,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said.
<p/>When you see a bit of earth you want,'' with something like a smile, <div class="bookquote">``take it, child, and make it come alive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' You remind me of some one else who loved the earth and things that grow. '' May I take it from anywhere--if it's not wanted?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) answered. '' There! You must go now, I am tired. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) touched the bell to call Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>'' Good-by. I shall be away all summer. '' Mrs. Medlock came so quickly that Mary thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must have been waiting in the corridor.
<p/>'' Mrs. Medlock,'' Mr. Craven said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``now I have seen the child I understand what Mrs. Sowerby meant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) must be less delicate before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) begins lessons.
<p/>Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) simple, healthy food. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) run wild in the garden. Don't look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) too much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) needs liberty and fresh air and romping about.
<p/>Mrs. Sowerby is to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) now and then and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) may sometimes go to the cottage. ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Medlock looked pleased.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was relieved to hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) need not <div class="bookquote">``look after''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mary too much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a tiresome charge and had indeed seen as little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dared.
<p/>In addition to this she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was fond of Martha's mother. '' Thank you, sir,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' Susan Sowerby and me went to school together
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'s as sensible and good-hearted a woman as you'd find in a day's walk. I never had any children myself
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'s had twelve, and there never was healthier or better ones. Miss Mary can get no harm from them. I'd always take Susan Sowerby's advice about children myself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'s what you might call healthy-minded--if you understand me.'' <div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craven/Mr. Archibald Craven/Archibald Craven</b></font>)</div>Mr. Craven answered. '' Take Miss Mary away now and send Pitcher to me.
<p/>'' When Mrs. Medlock left her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) at the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) own corridor Mary flew back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found Martha waiting there.
<p/>Martha had, in fact, hurried back after she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had removed the dinner service. '' I can have my garden! '' cried Mary.
<p/>'' I may have it where I like! I am not going to have a governess for a long time! Your mother is coming to see me
<p/>and I may go to your cottage! He (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) says a little girl like me could not do any harm and I may do what I like--anywhere!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Martha,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary solemnly, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) is really a nice man, only his (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) face is so miserable and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) forehead is all drawn together.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha delightedly, <div class="bookquote">``that was nice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) wasn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ran as quickly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) could to the garden.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had been away so much longer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) should and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knew Dickon would have to set out early on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) five-mile walk.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) slipped through the door under the ivy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) was not working where she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>). The gardening tools were laid together under a tree.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pitcher</b></font>) had gone away and the secret garden was empty--except for the robin who had just flown across the wall and sat on a standard rose-bush watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) ran to them, looking all round the place, but there was no Dickon to be seen. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s gone,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said woefully.
<p/>It was a piece of paper, in fact, it was a piece of the letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had printed for Martha to send to Dickon.
<p/>It was fastened on the bush with a long thorn, and in a minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knew Dickon had left it there.
<p/>'' Oh! was he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)--was he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)--was he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) only a wood fairy?'' Something white fastened to the standard rose-bush caught her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) eye. There were some roughly printed letters on it and a sort of picture.
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) could not tell what it was. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) saw it was meant for a nest with a bird sitting on it.
<p/>Underneath were the printed letters and they said: <div class="bookquote">``I will cum bak.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XIII '' I AM COLIN '' Mary took the picture back to the house when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) supper and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) showed it to Martha.
<p/>'' Eh!'' said Martha with great pride. '' I never knew our Dickon was as clever as that. That there's a picture of a missel thrush on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) nest, as large as life an' twice as natural.
<p/>'' Then Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message. He (<font color='blue'><b>COLIN</b></font>) had meant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>COLIN</b></font>) would keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) secret.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) garden was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nest and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was like a missel thrush. Oh, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did like that queer, common boy!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would come back the very next day and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fell asleep looking forward to the morning. But you never know what the weather will do in Yorkshire, particularly in the springtime.
<p/>It was pouring down in torrents and the wind was <div class="bookquote">``wuthering''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>round the corners and in the chimneys of the huge old house.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was awakened in the night by the sound of rain beating with heavy drops against her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) window. Mary sat up in bed and felt miserable and angry.
<p/>'' The rain is as contrary as I ever was,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' It came because it knew I did not want it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not cry, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hated the wind and its <div class="bookquote">``wuthering.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) threw herself back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pillow and buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not go to sleep again. The mournful sound kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) awake because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt mournful herself.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt happy it would probably have lulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to sleep. How it <div class="bookquote">``wuthered''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and how the big raindrops poured down and beat against the pane! ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour, when suddenly something made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sit up in bed and turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head toward the door listening.
<p/>It sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on crying,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) listened and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) listened.
<p/>'' It isn't the wind now,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said in a loud whisper. '' That isn't the wind. It is different. It is that crying I heard before.
<p/>The door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor, a far-off faint sound of fretful crying.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) listened for a few minutes and each minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) became more and more sure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must find out what it was.
<p/>It seemed even stranger than the secret garden and the buried key. Perhaps the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in a rebellious mood made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bold.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) foot out of bed and stood on the floor. '' I am going to find out what it is,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Everybody is in bed and I don't care about Mrs. Medlock--I don't care! '' There was a candle by her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) bedside and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) took it up and went softly out of the room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) remembered the corners she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) must turn to find the short corridor with the door covered with tapestry--the one Mrs. Medlock had come through the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) lost herself.
<p/>The corridor looked very long and dark, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was too excited to mind that. The sound had come up that passage.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) dim light, almost feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) way, her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) heart beating so loud that she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could hear it.
<p/>The far-off faint crying went on and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>). Sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again.
<p/>Was this the right corner to turn? She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) stopped and thought. Yes it was. Down this passage and then to the left, and then up two broad steps, and then to the right again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) stood in the corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly, though it was not loud.
<p/>It was on the other side of the wall at her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) left and a few yards farther on there was a door.
<p/>Yes, there was the tapestry door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) could see a glimmer of light coming from beneath it. The Someone was crying in that room, and it was quite a young Someone.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) walked to the door and pushed it open, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was standing in the room! It was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in it.
<p/>There was a low fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by the side of a carved four-posted bed hung with brocade, and on the bed was lying a boy, crying fretfully.
<p/>Mary wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in a real place or if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had fallen asleep again and was dreaming without knowing it.
<p/>The boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of ivory and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed to have eyes too big for it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had also a lot of hair which tumbled over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forehead in heavy locks and made his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thin face seem smaller.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked like a boy who had been ill, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was crying more as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were tired and cross than as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were in pain.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) crept across the room, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) drew nearer, the light attracted the boy's attention and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pillow and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gray eyes opening so wide that they seemed immense.
<p/>Mary stood near the door with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath. '' Who are you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said at last in a half-frightened whisper.
<p/>'' Are you a ghost?'' '' No, I am not,'' Mary answered, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own whisper sounding half frightened. '' Are you one?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stared and stared and stared. Mary could not help noticing what strange eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had. They were agate gray and they looked too big for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face because they had black lashes all round them.
<p/>'' No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) replied after waiting a moment or so. '' I am Colin. '' '' Who is Colin? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) faltered.
<p/>'' I am Colin Craven. Who are you?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am Mary Lennox. Mr. Craven is my uncle.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) is my father,'' said the boy.
<p/>'' Your father!'' gasped Mary. '' No one ever told me he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a boy! Why didn't they?'' <div class="bookquote">``Come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, still keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) strange eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with an anxious expression.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came close to the bed and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand and touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' You are real, aren't you?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said. '' I have such real dreams very often. You might be one of them. '' Mary had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put a piece of it between his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fingers. '' Rub that and see how thick and warm it is,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I will pinch you a little if you like, to show you how real I am. For a minute I thought you might be a dream too.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Where did you come from? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked. '' From my own room. The wind wuthered so I couldn't go to sleep
<p/>and I heard some one crying and wanted to find out who it was. What were you crying for? '' ''
<p/>Because I couldn't go to sleep either and my head ached. Tell me your name again. '' <div class="bookquote">``Mary Lennox. Did no one ever tell you I had come to live here?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was still fingering the fold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) wrapper, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began to look a little more as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) reality.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered. '' They daren't.'' <div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary. <div class="bookquote">``Because I should have been afraid you would see me.
<p/>I won't let people see me and talk me over.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary asked again, feeling more mystified every moment. <div class="bookquote">``Because I am like this always, ill and having to lie down.
<p/>My father won't let people talk me over either. The servants are not allowed to speak about me. If I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan't live.
<p/>My father hates to think I may be like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, what a queer house this is!'' Mary said. ''
<p/>What a queer house! Everything is a kind of secret. Rooms are locked up and gardens are locked up--and you! Have you been locked up?''
<p/>'' No. I stay in this room because I don't want to be moved out of it. It tires me too much.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does your father come and see you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary ventured. '' Sometimes. Generally when I am asleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't want to see me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary could not help asking again. A sort of angry shadow passed over the boy's face. '' My mother died when I was born and it makes him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wretched to look at me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thinks I don't know, but I've heard people talking. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) almost hates me.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hates the garden, because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died,'' said Mary half speaking to herself.
<p/>'' What garden? '' the boy asked. '' Oh! just--just a garden she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) used to like,'' Mary stammered. '' Have you been here always?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to places at the seaside, but I won't stay because people stare at me.
<p/>I used to wear an iron thing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor came from London to see me and said it was stupid.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) told them to take it off and keep me out in the fresh air. I hate fresh air and I don't want to go out.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didn't when first I came here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' Why do you keep looking at me like that?'' ''
<p/>Because of the dreams that are so real,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) answered rather fretfully. '' Sometimes when I open my eyes I don't believe I'm awake.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``We're both awake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) glanced round the room with its high ceiling and shadowy corners and dim fire-light.
<p/>It looks quite like a dream, and it's the middle of the night, and everybody in the house is asleep--everybody but us.
<p/>'' We are wide awake. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't want it to be a dream,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy said restlessly. Mary thought of something all at once.
<p/>'' If you don't like people to see you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``do you want me to go away? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) still held the fold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wrapper and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gave it a little pull.
<p/>'' No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. '' I should be sure you were a dream if you went. If you are real, sit down on that big footstool and talk.
<p/>I want to hear about you. '' Mary put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) candle on the table near the bed and sat down on the cushioned stool.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not want to go away at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to stay in the mysterious hidden-away room and talk to the mysterious boy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wanted to know how long she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been at Misselthwaite; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wanted to know which corridor her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room was on; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wanted to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been doing; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) disliked the moor as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) disliked it; where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had lived before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came to Yorkshire.
<p/>'' What do you want me to tell you? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered all these questions and many more and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lay back on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pillow and listened.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tell him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a great deal about India and about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) voyage across the ocean. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found out that because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been an invalid he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not learned things as other children had.
<p/>One of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nurses had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to read when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was quite little and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was always reading and looking at pictures in splendid books.
<p/>Though his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father rarely saw him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was awake, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was given all sorts of wonderful things to amuse himself with.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never seemed to have been amused, however. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could have anything he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked for and was never made to do anything he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not like to do.
<p/>'' Everyone is obliged to do what pleases me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said indifferently. '' It makes me ill to be angry. No one believes I shall live to grow up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased to matter to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at all.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed to like the sound of Mary's voice. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went on talking he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) listened in a drowsy, interested way.
<p/>Once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were not gradually falling into a doze. But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked a question which opened up a new subject.
<p/>'' How old are you?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked. '' I am ten,'' answered Mary, forgetting herself for the moment, <div class="bookquote">``and so are you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) demanded in a surprised voice. '' Because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key was buried.
<p/>And it has been locked for ten years. '' Colin half sat up, turning toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) elbows. ''
<p/>What garden door was locked? Who did it? Where was the key buried? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) exclaimed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were suddenly very much interested.
<p/>'' It--it was the garden Mr. Craven hates,'' said Mary nervously. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) locked the door. No one--no one knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) buried the key.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What sort of a garden is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>Colin persisted eagerly. '' No one has been allowed to go into it for ten years,'' was Mary's careful answer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) too had had nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) as it had attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>But it was too late to be careful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was too much like herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) asked question after question. Where was it?
<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) never looked for the door? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) never asked the gardeners? '' They won't talk about it,'' said Mary.
<p/>'' I think they have been told not to answer questions. '' <div class="bookquote">``I would make them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin. '' Could you?''
<p/>Mary faltered, beginning to feel frightened. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could make people answer questions, who knew what might happen! '' Everyone is obliged to please me.
<p/>I told you that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' If I were to live, this place would sometime belong to me. They all know that.
<p/>Mary had not known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) herself had been spoiled, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see quite plainly that this mysterious boy had been.
<p/>I would make them tell me. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought that the whole world belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). How peculiar he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was and how coolly he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spoke of not living.
<p/>'' Do you think you won't live? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked, partly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was curious and partly in hope of making him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forget the garden.
<p/>'' I don't suppose I shall,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answered as indifferently as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had spoken before. '' Ever since I remember anything I have heard people say I shan't.
<p/>At first they thought I was too little to understand and now they think I don't hear. But I do. My doctor is my father's cousin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is quite poor and if I die he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) will have all Misselthwaite when my father is dead. I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wouldn't want me to live.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you want to live?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>inquired Mary. '' No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered, in a cross, tired fashion. '' But I don't want to die.
<p/>When I feel ill I lie here and think about it until I cry and cry. '' <div class="bookquote">``I have heard you crying three times,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary said, <div class="bookquote">``but I did not know who it was.
<p/>Were you crying about that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did so want him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to forget the garden. '' I dare say,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us talk about something else. Talk about that garden. Don't you want to see it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary, in quite a low voice.
<p/>'' I do,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went on persistently. '' I don't think I ever really wanted to see anything before, but I want to see that garden.
<p/>I want the key dug up. I want the door unlocked. I would let them take me there in my chair.
<p/>That would be getting fresh air. I am going to make them open the door. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had become quite excited and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) strange eyes began to shine like stars and looked more immense than ever.
<p/>'' They have to please me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said. '' I will make them take me there and I will let you go, too.
<p/>'' Mary's hands clutched each other. Everything would be spoiled--everything! Dickon would never come back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would never again feel like a missel thrush with a safe-hidden nest.
<p/>'' Oh, don't--don't-- don't-- don't do that!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried out. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stared as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had gone crazy! <div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) exclaimed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered almost with a sob in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) throat, <div class="bookquote">``but if you make them open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secret again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>You said you wanted to see it. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) leaned still farther forward. '' A secret,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said. ''
<p/>What do you mean? Tell me. '' Mary's words almost tumbled over one another. '' You see--you see,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) panted, <div class="bookquote">``if no one knows but
<p/>ourselves--if there was a door, hidden somewhere under the ivy--if there was--and we could find it; and if we could slip through it together and shut it behind us, and no one knew any one was inside and we called it our garden and pretended that--that we were missel thrushes and it was our nest, and if we played there almost every day and dug and planted seeds and made it all come alive--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is it dead? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). '' It soon will be if no one cares for it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went on.
<p/>'' The bulbs will live but the roses-- '' He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) again as excited as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was herself. '' What are bulbs?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) put in quickly. '' They are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops. They are working in the earth now--pushing up pale green points because the spring is coming.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the spring coming? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. '' What is it like? You don't see it in rooms if you are ill.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the sunshine, and things pushing up and working under the earth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/>If the garden was a secret and we could get into it we could watch the things grow bigger every day, and see how many roses are alive.
<p/>'' Don't you see? Oh, don't you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) dropped back on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pillow and lay there with an odd expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' I never had a secret,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``except that one about not living to grow up. They don't know I know that, so it is a sort of secret.
<p/>If you won't make them take you to the garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>pleaded Mary, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps--I feel almost sure I can find out how to get in sometime.
<p/>And then--if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair, and if you can always do what you want to do, perhaps--perhaps we might find some boy who would push you, and we could go alone and it would always be a secret garden.
<p/>But I like this kind better.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I should--like--that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said very slowly, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes looking dreamy. '' I should like that.
<p/>I should not mind fresh air in a secret garden. '' Mary began to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath and feel safer because the idea of keeping the secret seemed to please him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt almost sure that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) kept on talking and could make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) see the garden in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen it he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would like it so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not bear to think that everybody might tramp in to it when they chose.
<p/>'' I'll tell you what I think it would be like, if we could go into it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' It has been shut up so long things have grown into a tangle perhaps.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lay quite still and listened while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went on talking about the roses which might have clambered from tree to tree and hung down--about the many birds which might have built their nests there because it was so safe.
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff, and there was so much to tell about the robin
<p/>The robin pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) smiled until he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) looked almost beautiful, and at first Mary had thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was even plainer than herself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) big eyes and heavy locks of hair.
<p/>'' and it was so easy and safe to talk about it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ceased to be afraid. '' I did not know birds could be like that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' But if you stay in a room you never see things. What a lot of things you know. I feel as if you had been inside that garden.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know what to say, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not say anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) evidently did not expect an answer and the next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a surprise.
<p/>'' I am going to let you look at something,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said. '' Do you see that rose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel-piece?
<p/>'' Mary had not noticed it before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked up and saw it. It was a curtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture.
<p/>'' Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered. '' There is a cord hanging from it,'' said Colin. <div class="bookquote">``Go and pull it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pulled it the silk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a picture. It was the picture of a girl with a laughing face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had bright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gay, lovely eyes were exactly like Colin's unhappy ones, agate gray and looking twice as big as they really were because of the black lashes all round them.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is my mother,'' said Colin complainingly. '' I don't see why she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) died. Sometimes I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for doing it.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How queer!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) grumbled.
<p/>'' I dare say I should have lived, too. And my father would not have hated to look at me. I dare say I should have had a strong back.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is much prettier than you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes are just like yours--at least they are the same shape and color.
<p/>Draw the curtain again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mary did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was told and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) footstool. '' Why is the curtain drawn over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) moved uncomfortably. '' I made them do it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said. '' Sometimes I don't like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looking at me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) smiles too much when I am ill and miserable. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is mine and I don't want everyone to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>'' There were a few moments of silence and then Mary spoke. '' What would Mrs. Medlock do if she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) found out that I had been here?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) inquired. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) would do as I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) to do,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered. '' And I should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) that I wanted you to come here and talk to me every day.
<p/>I am glad you came. '' '' So am I,'' said Mary. '' I will come as often as I can, but''--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hesitated--<div class="bookquote">``I shall have to look every day for the garden door.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you must,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin, <div class="bookquote">``and you can tell me about it afterward. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lay thinking a few minutes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had done before, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spoke again.
<p/>'' I think you shall be a secret, too,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' I will not tell them until they find out.
<p/>I can always send the nurse out of the room and say that I want to be by myself. Do you know Martha?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) waits on me. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head toward the outer corridor.
<p/>The nurse went away yesterday to stay all night with her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) sister and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) always makes Martha attend to me when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wants to go out.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) is the one who is asleep in the other room. Martha shall tell you when to come here. ''
<p/>Then Mary understood Martha's troubled look when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had asked questions about the crying. '' Martha knew about you all the time?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. '' Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) often attends to me. The nurse likes to get away from me and then Martha comes.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I have been here a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' Shall I go away now? Your eyes look sleepy. ''
<p/>Shut your eyes,'' said Mary, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) footstool closer, ``and I will do what my Ayah used to do in India.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could go to sleep before you leave me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said rather shyly. '' I will pat your hand and stroke it and sing something quite low.''
<p/>Somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and did not want him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to lie awake, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) leaned against the bed and began to stroke and pat his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand and sing a very low little chanting song in Hindustani.
<p/>That is nice,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said more drowsily still, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went on chanting and stroking, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) again his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) black lashes were lying close against his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cheeks, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes were shut
<p/>'' I should like that perhaps,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said drowsily. '' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was fast asleep. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got up softly, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) candle and crept away without making a sound.
<p/>CHAPTER XIV A YOUNG RAJAH The moor was hidden in mist when the morning came, and the rain had not stopped pouring down.
<p/>Martha was so busy that Mary had no opportunity of talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), but in the afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to come and sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in the nursery.
<p/>There could be no going out of doors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came bringing the stocking she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was always knitting when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was doing nothing else.
<p/>'' What's the matter with thee? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked as soon as they sat down. '' Tha' looks as if tha'd somethin' to say.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I have. I have found out what the crying was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. Martha let her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knitting drop on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knee and gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) with startled eyes.
<p/>'' Tha' hasn't! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) exclaimed. '' Never!'' <div class="bookquote">``I heard it in the night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary went on. '' And I got up and went to see where it came from.
<p/>It was Colin. I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). '' Martha's face became red with fright. '' Eh! Miss Mary! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said half crying.
<p/>'' Tha' shouldn't have done it--tha' shouldn't! Tha'll get me in trouble. I never told thee nothin' about him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)--but tha'll get me in trouble.
<p/>I shall lose my place and what'll mother do!'' <div class="bookquote">``You won't lose your place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was glad I came.
<p/>We talked and talked and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was glad I came. '' <div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>cried Martha. '' Art tha' sure?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s a big lad to cry like a baby, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s in a passion he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'ll fair scream just to frighten us.
<p/>Tha' doesn't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s like when anything vexes him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knows us daren't call our souls our own.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wasn't vexed,'' said Mary.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) asked me questions and I sat on a big footstool and talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) about India and about the robin and gardens.
<p/>'' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) if I should go away and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) made me stay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wouldn't let me go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) let me see his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mother's picture.
<p/>Before I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) I sang him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) to sleep. '' Martha fairly gasped with amazement. '' I can scarcely believe thee!
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'d been like he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) is most times he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'d have throwed himself into one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tantrums and roused th' house.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) protested. '' It's as if tha'd walked straight into a lion's den. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) won't let strangers look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) let me look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) all the time and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked at me. We stared!'' said Mary.
<p/>'' I don't know what to do!'' cried agitated Martha. '' If Mrs. Medlock finds out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'ll think I broke orders and told thee
<p/>and I shall be packed back to mother.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) is not going to tell Mrs. Medlock anything about it yet.
<p/>It's to be a sort of secret just at first,'' said Mary firmly. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) says everybody is obliged to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pleases.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Aye, that's true enough--th' bad lad! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>sighed Martha, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) forehead with her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) apron. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) says Mrs. Medlock must.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) wants me to come and talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) every day. And you are to tell me when he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) wants me.''
<p/>You can't if you are doing what he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) wants you to do and everybody is ordered to obey him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>),'' Mary argued.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha; <div class="bookquote">``I shall lose my place--I shall for sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>'' '' Does tha' mean to say,'' cried Martha with wide open eyes, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was nice to thee!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) almost liked me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary answered. '' Then tha' must have bewitched him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)! '' decided Martha, drawing a long breath.
<p/>'' Do you mean Magic? '' inquired Mary. '' I've heard about Magic in India, but I can't make it. I just went into his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) room
<p/>and I was so surprised to see him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) I stood and stared. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) turned round and stared at me.
<p/>And it was so queer being there alone together in the middle of the night and not knowing about each other.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) thought I was a ghost or a dream and I thought perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was. And we began to ask each other questions.
<p/>And when I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) if I must go away he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said I must not. '' '' Th' world's comin' to a end!
<p/>'' gasped Martha. '' What is the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)?'' asked Mary. '' Nobody knows for sure and certain,'' said Martha.
<p/>'' Mr. Craven went off his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) head like when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was born. Th' doctors thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'d have to be put in a `sylum.
<p/>It was because Mrs. Craven died like I told you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wouldn't set eyes on th' baby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) just raved and said it'd be another hunchback like him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)
<p/>and it'd better die.'' <div class="bookquote">``Is Colin a hunchback?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary asked. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) didn't look like one.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) isn't yet,'' said Martha.
<p/>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began all wrong. Mother said that there was enough trouble and raging in th' house to set any child wrong.
<p/>They was afraid his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) back was weak an' they've always been takin' care of it--keepin' him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lyin' down and not lettin' him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) walk.
<p/>Once they made him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wear a brace but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) fretted so he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was downright ill. Then a big doctor came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) an' made them take it off.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) talked to th' other doctor quite rough--in a polite way. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said there'd been too much medicine and too much lettin'
<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own way. '' <div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s a very spoiled boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s th' worst young nowt as ever was!'' said Martha.
<p/>'' I won't say as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hasn't been ill a good bit. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s had coughs an' colds that's nearly killed him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) two or three times.
<p/>Once he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had rheumatic fever an' once he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had typhoid. Eh! Mrs. Medlock did get a fright then. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'d been out of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was talkin' to th' nurse, thinkin'
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) didn't know nothin', an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said, `He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'ll die this time sure enough, an' best thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) an' for everybody.'
<p/>An' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) an' there he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) big eyes open, starin' at her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) as sensible as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) didn't know wha'd happen but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) just stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) an' says, `You give me some water an' stop talkin'.'
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) will die?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary. '' Mother says there's no reason why any child should live that gets no fresh air

<p/>an' doesn't do nothin' but lie on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) back an' read picture-books an' take medicine. '' Mary sat and looked at the fire.
<p/>I wonder,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said slowly, <div class="bookquote">``if it would not do him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) good to go out into a garden and watch things growing.
<p/>One of th' worst fits he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) ever had,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Martha, <div class="bookquote">``was one time they took him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) out where the roses is by the fountain.
<p/>rose cold' an' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) began to sneeze an' said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'d got it an' then a new gardener as didn't know th' rules passed by an' looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) curious.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) threw himself into a passion an' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'d looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was going to be a hunchback.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>It did me good.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'d been readin' in a paper about people gettin' somethin' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) called ' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cried himself into a fever an' was ill all night.''
<p/>'' If he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) ever gets angry at me, I'll never go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) again,'' said Mary. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'ll have thee if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wants thee,'' said Martha.
<p/>'' Tha' may as well know that at th' start. '' Very soon afterward a bell rang and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) rolled up her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knitting.
<p/>'' I dare say th' nurse wants me to stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) a bit,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said. '' I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s in a good temper.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was out of the room about ten minutes and then she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) came back with a puzzled expression. '' Well, tha' has bewitched him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s up on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sofa with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) picture-books. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s told the nurse to stay away until six o'clock. I'm to wait in the next room.
<p/>Th' minute she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was gone he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) called me to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) an' says, 'I want Mary Lennox to come and talk to me, and remember you're not to tell any one.'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) did not want to see Colin as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) wanted to see Dickon; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) wanted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) very much.
<p/>There was a bright fire on the hearth when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room, and in the daylight she (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) saw it was a very beautiful room indeed.
<p/>There were rich colors in the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on the walls which made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite of the gray sky and falling rain.
<p/>You'd better go as quick as you can. '' Mary was quite willing to go quickly. Colin looked rather like a picture himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was wrapped in a velvet dressing-gown and sat against a big brocaded cushion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had a red spot on each cheek.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' I've been thinking about you all morning.'' <div class="bookquote">``I've been thinking about you, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary. ''
<p/>You don't know how frightened Martha is. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) says Mrs. Medlock will think she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) told me about you and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) will be sent away.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) frowned. <div class="bookquote">``Go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) to come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) is in the next room. '' Mary went and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) back.
<p/>Poor Martha was shaking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) shoes. Colin was still frowning. '' Have you to do what I please or have you not?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) demanded. '' I have to do what you please, sir,'' Martha faltered, turning quite red. '' Has Medlock to do what I please?''
<p/>Well, then, if I order you to bring Miss Mary to me, how can Medlock send you away if she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) finds it out?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody has, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha. '' <div class="bookquote">``Please don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>), sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>pleaded Martha. '' I'll send her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) away if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) dares to say a word about such a thing,'' said Master Craven grandly.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) wouldn't like that, I can tell you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>bobbing a curtsy, <div class="bookquote">``I want to do my duty, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I want is your duty''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin more grandly still. '' I'll take care of you. Now go away. ''
<p/>When the door closed behind Martha, Colin found Mistress Mary gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondering. ''
<p/>Why do you look at me like that? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' What are you thinking about?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am thinking about two things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What are they? Sit down and tell me.'' '' This is the first one,'' said Mary, seating herself on the big stool.
<p/>'' Once in India I saw a boy who was a Rajah. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) had rubies and emeralds and diamonds stuck all over him (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) people just as you spoke to Martha. Everybody had to do everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) told them--in a minute.
<p/>I think they would have been killed if they hadn't. '' <div class="bookquote">``I shall make you tell me about Rajahs presently,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but first tell me what the second thing was.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``how different you are from Dickon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>'' Who is Dickon?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) said. '' What a queer name!
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might as well tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could talk about Dickon without mentioning the secret garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had liked to hear Martha talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>).
<p/>Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) longed to talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>). It would seem to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) nearer. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) is Martha's brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) is twelve years old,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) explained.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) is not like any one else in the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) can charm foxes and squirrels and birds just as the natives in India charm snakes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) plays a very soft tune on a pipe and they come and listen. '' There were some big books on a table at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) side and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) dragged one suddenly toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>).
<p/>'' There is a picture of a snake-charmer in this,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Come and look at it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The book was a beautiful one with superb colored illustrations and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) turned to one of them.
<p/>'' Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) do that? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) asked eagerly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) played on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) pipe and they listened,'' Mary explained. ''
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) doesn't call it Magic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) says it's because he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) lives on the moor so much and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) knows their ways.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) feels sometimes as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) was a bird or a rabbit himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) likes them so. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) asked the robin questions.
<p/>It seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps. '' Colin lay back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cushion and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes grew larger and larger and the spots on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cheeks burned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me some more about him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knows all about eggs and nests,'' Mary went on. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knows where foxes and badgers and otters live.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) keeps them secret so that other boys won't find their holes and frighten them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knows about everything that grows or lives on the moor.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) like the moor? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin. '' How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) when it's such a great, bare, dreary place?'' ''
<p/>Thousands of lovely things grow on it and there are thousands of little creatures all busy building nests and making holes and burrows and chippering or singing or squeaking to each other.
<p/>It's the most beautiful place,'' protested Mary. '' They are so busy and having such fun under the earth or in the trees or heather.
<p/>It's their world. '' <div class="bookquote">``How do you know all that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) elbow to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). ''
<p/>I have never been there once, really,'' said Mary suddenly remembering. '' I only drove over it in the dark. I thought it was hideous.
<p/>When Dickon talks about it you feel as if you saw things and heard them and as if you were standing in the heather with the sun shining and the gorse smelling like honey--and all full of bees and butterflies.
<p/>Martha told me about it first and then Dickon. '' <div class="bookquote">``You never see anything if you are ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin restlessly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked like a person listening to a new sound in the distance and wondering what it was. '' You can't if you stay in a room,'' said Mary.
<p/>'' I couldn't go on the moor,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said in a resentful tone. Mary was silent for a minute and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said something bold.
<p/>'' You might--sometime. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) moved as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were startled. <div class="bookquote">``Go on the moor! How could I? I am going to die.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary unsympathetically. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) didn't like the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had of talking about dying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not feel very sympathetic.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt rather as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) almost boasted about it. '' Oh, I've heard it ever since I remember,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered crossly.
<p/>'' They are always whispering about it and thinking I don't notice. They wish I would, too. '' Mistress Mary felt quite contrary.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pinched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lips together. '' If they wished I would,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't. Who wishes you would?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The servants--and of course Dr. Craven because he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) would get Misselthwaite and be rich instead of poor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) daren't say so, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) always looks cheerful when I am worse. When I had typhoid fever his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) face got quite fat.
<p/>I think my father wishes it, too. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary quite obstinately. That made Colin turn and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) again.
<p/>'' Don't you?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lay back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cushion and was still, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were thinking.
<p/>And there was quite a long silence. Perhaps they were both of them thinking strange things children do not usually think.
<p/>'' I like the grand doctor from London, because he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) made them take the iron thing off,'' said Mary at last
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) say you were going to die?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>. '' What did he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) say?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) didn't whisper,'' Colin answered. ''
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew I hated whispering. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) say one thing quite aloud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, `The lad might live if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mind to it.
<p/>Put him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) in the humor.' It sounded as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was in a temper.'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you who would put you in the humor, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary reflecting.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would like this thing to be settled one way or the other. '' I believe Dickon would.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s always talking about live things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) never talks about dead things or things that are ill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying--or looking down at the earth to see something growing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) has such round blue eyes and they are so wide open with looking about. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) laughs such a big laugh with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wide mouth--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cheeks are as red--as red as cherries.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stool nearer to the sofa and her (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) expression quite changed at the remembrance of the wide curving mouth and wide open eyes.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``See here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' Don't let us talk about dying; I don't like it. Let us talk about living.
<p/>Let us talk and talk about Dickon. And then we will look at your pictures. '' It was the best thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could have said.
<p/>To talk about Dickon meant to talk about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people who lived in it on sixteen shillings a week--and the children who got fat on the moor grass like the wild ponies.
<p/>And about Dickon's mother--and the skipping-rope--and the moor with the sun on it--and about pale green points sticking up out of the black sod.
<p/>And it was all so alive that Mary talked more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had ever talked before--and Colin both talked and listened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had never done either before.
<p/>And they laughed so that in the end they were making as much noise as if they had been two ordinary healthy natural ten-year-old creatures--instead of a hard, little, unloving girl and a sickly boy who believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was going to die.
<p/>And they both began to laugh over nothings as children will when they are happy together. They enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures and they forgot about the time.
<p/>They had been laughing quite loudly over Ben Weatherstaff and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) robin, and Colin was actually sitting up as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had forgotten about his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) weak back, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) suddenly remembered something.
<p/>'' Do you know there is one thing we have never once thought of,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' We are cousins. ''
<p/>It seemed so queer that they had talked so much and never remembered this simple thing that they laughed more than ever, because they had got into the humor to laugh at anything.
<p/>And in the midst of the fun the door opened and in walked Dr. Craven and Mrs. Medlock. Dr. Craven started in actual alarm and Mrs. Medlock almost fell back because he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had accidentally bumped against her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>exclaimed poor Mrs. Medlock with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) eyes almost starting out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) head. '' Good Lord!'' '' What is this?'' said Dr. Craven, coming forward.
<p/>'' What does it mean? '' Then Mary was reminded of the boy Rajah again. Colin answered as if neither the doctor's alarm nor Mrs. Medlock's terror were of the slightest consequence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was as little disturbed or frightened as if an elderly cat and dog had walked into the room. '' This is my cousin, Mary Lennox,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) to come and talk to me. I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) must come and talk to me whenever I send for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>).
<p/>'' Dr. Craven turned reproachfully to Mrs. Medlock. '' Oh, sir'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) panted. '' I don't know how it's happened. There's not a servant on the place tha'd dare to talk--they all have their orders.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody told her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) heard me crying and found me herself. I am glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) came. Don't be silly, Medlock.
<p/>Mary saw that Dr. Craven did not look pleased, but it was quite plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) dare not oppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) patient.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) sat down by Colin and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pulse. '' I am afraid there has been too much excitement. Excitement is not good for you, my boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I should be excited if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) kept away,'' answered Colin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes beginning to look dangerously sparkling. '' I am better.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven looked at each other in a troubled way, but there was evidently nothing to be done.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) makes me better. The nurse must bring up her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) tea with mine. We will have tea together. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) does look rather better, sir,'' ventured Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>'' But''--thinking the matter over--<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) looked better this morning before she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) came into the room. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) came into the room last night.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) stayed with me a long time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) sang a Hindustani song to me and it made me go to sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/>'' I was better when I wakened up. I wanted my breakfast. I want my tea now. Tell nurse, Medlock. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) talked to the nurse for a few minutes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) came into the room and said a few words of warning to Colin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) must not talk too much; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) must not forget that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was ill; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) must not forget that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was very easily tired.
<p/>Dr. Craven did not stay very long. Mary thought that there seemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was not to forget.
<p/>Colin looked fretful and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strange black-lashed eyes fixed on Dr. Craven's face. '' I want to forget it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said at last.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) makes me forget it. That is why I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' Dr. Craven did not look happy when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) left the room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had become a stiff, silent child again as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) entered and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) could not see what the attraction was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) gave a puzzled glance at the little girl sitting on the large stool. The boy actually did look brighter, however--and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sighed rather heavily as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went down the corridor.
<p/>They are always wanting me to eat things when I don't want to,'' said Colin, as the nurse brought in the tea and put it on the table by the sofa.
<p/>'' '' Now, if you'll eat I will. Those muffins look so nice and hot. Tell me about Rajahs. '' CHAPTER XV NEST BUILDING
<p/>After another week of rain the high arch of blue sky appeared again and the sun which poured down was quite hot.
<p/>Though there had been no chance to see either the secret garden or Dickon, Mistress Mary had enjoyed herself very much.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had spent hours of every day with Colin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room, talking about Rajahs or gardens or Dickon and the cottage on the moor.
<p/>They had looked at the splendid books and pictures and sometimes Mary had read things to Colin, and sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had read a little to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was amused and interested she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) scarcely looked like an invalid at all, except that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face was so colorless and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was always on the sofa.
<p/>You are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to go following things up like you
<p/>The week had not seemed long. '' did that night,'' Mrs. Medlock said once. '' But there's no saying it's not been a sort of blessing to the lot of us.
<p/>The nurse was just going to give up the case because she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was so sick of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) doesn't mind staying now
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends. you've gone on duty with her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>),'' laughing a little.
<p/>There were certain things she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) wanted to find out from him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) must find them out without asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) direct questions.
<p/>In the first place, as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) began to like to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) wanted to discover whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was the kind of boy you could tell a secret to.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not in the least like Dickon, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was evidently so pleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) thought perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could be trusted.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) talks with Colin, Mary had tried to be very cautious about the secret garden. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not known him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) long enough to be sure.
<p/>: If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could be trusted--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) really could--wouldn't it be possible to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) to the garden without having any one find it out?
<p/>The grand doctor had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) must have fresh air and Colin had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would not mind fresh air in a secret garden.
<p/>Perhaps if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had a great deal of fresh air and knew Dickon and the robin and saw things growing he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) might not think so much about dying.
<p/>Mary had seen herself in the glass sometimes lately when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had realized that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked quite a different creature from the child she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arrived from India.
<p/>The second thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to find out was this This child looked nicer. Even Martha had seen a change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>).
<p/>'' Th' air from th' moor has done thee good already,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had said. '' Tha`rt not nigh so yeller and tha`rt not nigh so scrawny.
<p/>Even tha' hair doesn't slamp down on tha' head so flat. It's got some life in it so as it sticks out a bit.
<p/>'' '' It's like me,'' said Mary. '' It's growing stronger and fatter. I'm sure there's more of it. '' <div class="bookquote">``It looks it, for sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha, ruffling it up a little round her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' Tha`rt not half so ugly when it's that way an' there's a bit o' red in tha' cheeks. '' If gardens and fresh air had been good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) perhaps they would be good for Colin.
<p/>But then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hated people to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would not like to see Dickon. '' Why does it make you angry when you are looked at?
<p/>Then when they took me to the seaside and I used to lie in my carriage everybody used to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my nurse
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) inquired one day. '' I always hated it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``even when I was very little. and then they would begin to whisper
<p/>and I knew then they were saying I shouldn't live to grow up. Then sometimes the ladies would pat my cheeks and say `Poor child!'
<p/>Once when a lady did that I screamed out loud and bit her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so frightened she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ran away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought you had gone mad like a dog,'' said Mary, not at all admiringly. '' I don't care what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought,'' said Colin, frowning.
<p/>'' I wonder why you didn't scream and bite me when I came into your room?'' said Mary. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to smile slowly.
<p/>'' I thought you were a ghost or a dream,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' You can't bite a ghost or a dream, and if you scream they don't care.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Would you hate it if--if a boy looked at you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary asked uncertainly. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lay back on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cushion and paused thoughtfully.
<p/>'' There's one boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said quite slowly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were thinking over every word, <div class="bookquote">``there's one boy I believe I shouldn't mind.
<p/>It's that boy who knows where the foxes live--Dickon.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' I'm sure you wouldn't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),'' said Mary. '' The birds don't and other animals,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, still thinking it over, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps that's why I shouldn't.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) laughed and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) laughed too; in fact it ended in their both laughing a great deal and finding the idea of a boy animal hiding in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hole very funny indeed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s a sort of animal charmer and I am a boy animal. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>What Mary felt afterward was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) need not fear about Dickon.
<p/>The sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and there was something so joyous in the sight of it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) jumped out of bed and ran to the window.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) drew up the blinds and opened the window itself and a great waft of fresh, scented air blew in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>On that first morning when the sky was blue again Mary wakened very early. The moor was blue and the whole world looked as if something Magic had happened to it.
<p/>There were tender little fluting sounds here and there and everywhere, as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up for a concert.
<p/>It will make the green points push up and up and up, and it will make the bulbs and roots work and struggle with all their might under the earth.
<p/>Mary put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand out of the window and held it in the sun. '' It's warm--warm!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) kneeled down and leaned out of the window as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could, breathing big breaths and sniffing the air until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) laughed because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remembered what Dickon's mother had said about the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nose quivering like a rabbit's.
<p/>'' It must be very early,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' The little clouds are all pink and I've never seen the sky look like this.
<p/>No one is up. I don't even hear the stable boys. '' A sudden thought made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) scramble to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feet.
<p/>'' I can't wait! I am going to see the garden! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had learned to dress herself by this time and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) clothes in five minutes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew a small side door which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could unbolt herself and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) flew downstairs in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stocking feet and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) shoes in the hall.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when the door was open she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sprang across the step with one bound, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was standing on the grass, which seemed to have turned green, and with the sun pouring down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and warm sweet wafts about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and the fluting and twittering and singing coming from every bush and tree.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky and it was so blue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime light that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must flute and sing aloud herself and knew that thrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it.
<p/>The grass is greener and things are sticking up everywhere and things are uncurling and green buds of leaves are showing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran around the shrubs and paths towards the secret garden. '' It is all different already,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' This afternoon I am sure Dickon will come.
<p/>'' The long warm rain had done strange things to the herbaceous beds which bordered the walk by the lower wall.
<p/>There were things sprouting and pushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actually here and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the stems of crocuses.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was startled by a curious loud sound.
<p/>Six months before Mistress Mary would not have seen how the world was waking up, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) missed nothing. It was the caw--caw of a crow
<p/>and it came from the top of the wall, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked up, there sat a big glossy-plumaged blue-black bird, looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very wisely indeed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never seen a crow so close before and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a little nervous, but the next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wings and flapped away across the garden.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got fairly into the garden she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) probably did intend to stay because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had alighted on a dwarf apple-tree and under the apple-tree was lying a little reddish animal with a Bushy tail, and both of them were watching the stooping body and rust-red head of Dickon, who was kneeling on the grass working hard.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not going to stay inside and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pushed the door open wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would. Mary flew across the grass to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>'' Oh, Dickon! Dickon! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried out. '' How could you get here so early! How could you! The sun has only just got up!
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got up himself, laughing and glowing, and tousled; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes like a bit of the sky. '' Eh!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I was up long before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). How could I have stayed abed! Th' world's all fair begun again this mornin', it has.
<p/>An' it's workin' an' hummin' an' scratchin' an' pipin' an' nest-buildin' an' breathin' out scents, till you've got to be out on it `stead o' lyin' on your back.
<p/>When th' sun did jump up, th' moor went mad for joy, an' I was in the midst of th' heather
<p/>, an' I run like mad myself, shoutin' an' singin'. An' I come straight here. I couldn't have stayed away. Why, th' garden was lyin' here waitin'!''
<p/>Mary put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chest, panting, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been running herself. '' Oh, Dickon! Dickon! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) talking to a stranger, the little bushy-tailed animal rose from its place under the tree and came to him (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>), and the rook, cawing once, flew down from its branch and settled quietly on his (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>'' I'm so happy I can scarcely breathe! '' This is th' little fox cub,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) said, rubbing the little reddish animal's head.
<p/>'' It's named Captain. An' this here's Soot. Soot he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) flew across th' moor with me an' Captain he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) run same as if th' hounds had been after him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<p/>They both felt same as I did. '' Neither of the creatures looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) were the least afraid of Mary.
<p/>When Dickon began to walk about, Soot stayed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) shoulder and Captain trotted quietly close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) side. <div class="bookquote">``See here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``See how these has pushed up, an' these an' these! An' Eh! Look at these here!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) threw himself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) knees and Mary went down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<p/>They had come upon a whole clump of crocuses burst into purple and orange and gold. Mary bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face down and kissed and kissed them.
<p/>'' You never kiss a person in that way,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head. '' Flowers are so different.
<p/>Eh!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I've kissed mother many a time that way when I come in from th' moor after a day's roamin' an' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood there at th' door in th' sun, lookin' so glad an' comfortable.
<p/>They ran from one part of the garden to another and found so many wonders that they were obliged to remind themselves that they must whisper or speak low.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) looked puzzled but smiled. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) swelling leafbuds on rose branches which had seemed dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ten thousand new green points pushing through the mould.
<p/>They put their eager young noses close to the earth and sniffed its warmed springtime breathing; they dug and pulled and laughed low with rapture until Mistress Mary's hair was as tumbled as Dickon's and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cheeks were almost as poppy red as his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<p/>There was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning, and in the midst of them came a delight more delightful than all, because it was more wonderful.
<p/>Swiftly something flew across the wall and darted through the trees to a close grown corner, a little flare of red-breasted bird with something hanging from its beak.
<p/>Dickon stood quite still and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hand on Mary almost as if they had suddenly found themselves laughing in a church.
<p/>'' We munnot stir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) whispered in broad Yorkshire. '' We munnot scarce breathe. I knowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was mate-huntin' when I seed him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) last.
<p/>It's Ben Weatherstaff's robin. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s buildin' his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) nest. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'ll stay here if us don't fight him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>). '' They settled down softly upon the grass and sat there without moving.
<p/>'' Us mustn't seem as if us was watchin' him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) too close,'' said Dickon. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'d be out with us for good if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) got th' notion us
<p/>was interferin' now. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'ll be a good bit different till all this is over. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s settin' up housekeepin'. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'ll be shyer an' readier to take things ill.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s got no time for visitin' an' gossipin'. Us must keep still a bit an' try to look as if us was grass an' trees an' bushes.
<p/>Then when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s got used to seein' us I'll chirp a bit an' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'ll know us'll not be in his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) way.
<p/>Mistress Mary was not at all sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew, as Dickon seemed to, how to try to look like grass and trees and bushes.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had said the queer thing as if it were the simplest and most natural thing in the world, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt it must be quite easy to him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), and indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) for a few minutes carefully, wondering if it was possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) to quietly turn green and put out branches and leaves.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) only sat wonderfully still, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) spoke dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) voice to such a softness that it was curious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could.
<p/>'' '' It's part o' th' springtime, this nest-buildin' is,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said. '' I warrant it's been goin' on in th' same way every year since th' world was begun.
<p/>They've got their way o' thinkin' and doin' things an' a body had better not meddle. You can lose a friend in springtime easier than any other season if you're too curious.''
<p/>'' If we talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) I can't help looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),'' Mary said as softly as possible. '' We must talk of something else.
<p/>There is something I want to tell you.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'ll like it better if us talks o' somethin' else,'' said Dickon.
<p/>'' What is it tha's got to tell me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well--do you know about Colin? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whispered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>'' What does tha' know about him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) asked. '' I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). I have been to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) every day this week.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wants me to come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) says I'm making him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) forget about being ill and dying,'' answered Mary. Dickon looked actually relieved as soon as the surprise died away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) round face.
<p/>'' I am glad o' that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) exclaimed. '' I'm right down glad. It makes me easier. I knowed I must say nothin' about him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)
<p/>an' I don't like havin' to hide things.'' '' Don't you like hiding the garden?'' said Mary. '' I'll never tell about it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'' But I says to mother, `Mother,' I says, 'I got a secret to keep. It's not a bad `un, tha' knows that.
<p/>It's no worse than hidin' where a bird's nest is. Tha' doesn't mind it, does tha'?' '' Mary always wanted to hear about mother.
<p/>'' What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) say? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked, not at all afraid to hear. Dickon grinned sweet-temperedly. '' It was just like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dickon</b></font>) answered.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) give my head a bit of a rub an' laughed an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) says, `Eh, lad, tha' can have all th' secrets tha' likes.
<p/>Everybody as knowed about Mester Craven knowed there was a little lad as was like to be a cripple, an' they knowed Mester Craven didn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) to be talked about.
<p/>Folks is sorry for Mester Craven because Mrs. Craven was such a pretty young lady an' they was so fond of each other.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock stops in our cottage whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) goes to Thwaite an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) doesn't mind talkin' to mother before us children, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) knows us has been brought up to be trusty.
<p/>'' I've knowed thee twelve year'.' '' <div class="bookquote">``How did you know about Colin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary. '' How did tha' find out about him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)?
<p/>Martha was in fine trouble th' last time she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) came home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said tha'd heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) frettin' an' tha' was askin' questions an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) didn't know what to say.
<p/>Mary told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) story about the midnight wuthering of the wind which had wakened her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and about the faint far-off sounds of the complaining voice which had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) down the dark corridors with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) candle and had ended with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opening of the door of the dimly lighted room with the carven four-posted bed in the corner.
<p/>'' When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) described the small ivory-white face and the strange black-rimmed eyes Dickon shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head. '' Them's just like his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mother's eyes, only hers was always laughin', they say,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>an' it's because his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes is so like his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mother's an' yet looks so different in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) miserable bit of a face.''
<p/>'' They say as Mr. Craven can't bear to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s awake <div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wants to die?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>whispered Mary.
<p/>'' No, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'d never been born. Mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) says that's th' worst thing on earth for a child.
<p/>Mester Craven he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'d buy anythin' as money could buy for th' poor lad but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'d like to forget as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s on earth.
<p/>Them as is not wanted scarce ever thrives. For one thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'ll look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) some day and find he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s growed hunchback.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s always thinking that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) should feel a lump coming he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) should go crazy and scream himself to death.
<p/>'' Colin's so afraid of it himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) won't sit up,'' said Mary. '' '' '' Eh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) oughtn't to lie there thinkin' things like that,'' said Dickon.
<p/>The fox was lying on the grass close by him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>), looking up to ask for a pat now and then, and Dickon bent down and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) neck softly and thought a few minutes in silence.
<p/>'' No lad could get well as thought them sort o' things. '' Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) head and looked round the garden.
<p/>'' When first we got in here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it seemed like everything was gray. Look round now and tell me if tha' doesn't see a difference.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mary looked and caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath a little. <div class="bookquote">``Why! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``the gray wall is changing. It is as if a green mist were creeping over it.
<p/>It's almost like a green gauze veil.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon. '' An' it'll be greener and greener till th' gray's all gone.
<p/>Can tha' guess what I was thinkin'? '' <div class="bookquote">``I know it was something nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary eagerly. '' I believe it was something about Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinkin' that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was out here he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wouldn't be watchin' for lumps to grow on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) back; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'d be watchin' for buds to break on th' rose-bushes, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'d likely be healthier,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>explained Dickon.
<p/>'' '' I was wonderin' if us could ever get him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) in th' humor to come out here an' lie under th' trees in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) carriage.''
<p/>I've wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could keep a secret and I've wondered if we could bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) here without any one seeing us.
<p/>'' I've been wondering that myself. I've thought of it almost every time I've talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>),'' said Mary. '' I thought perhaps you could push his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) carriage.
<p/>The doctor said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) must have fresh air and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wants us to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) out no one dare disobey him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) won't go out for other people and perhaps they will be glad if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) will go out with us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could order the gardeners to keep away so they wouldn't find out.
<p/>'' Dickon was thinking very hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) scratched Captain's back. '' It'd be good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), I'll warrant,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Us'd not be thinkin' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'d better never been born. Us'd be just two children watchin' a garden grow, an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'d be another.
<p/>Two lads an' a little lass just lookin' on at th' springtime. I warrant it'd be better than doctor's stuff.'' ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s been lying in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) room so long and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s always been so afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) back that it has made him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) queer,'' said Mary.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has been too ill to notice things and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hates going out of doors and hates gardens and gardeners.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) knows a good many things out of books but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) doesn't know anything else. But he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) likes to hear about this garden because it is a secret.
<p/>I daren't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) much but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wanted to see it. '' <div class="bookquote">``Us'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) out here sometime for sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon.
<p/>'' I could push his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) carriage well enough. Has tha' noticed how th' robin an' his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mate has been workin' while we've been sittin' here?
<p/>Look at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) perched on that branch wonderin' where it'd be best to put that twig he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s got in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) beak.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) made one of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) low whistling calls and the robin turned his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) inquiringly, still holding his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) twig.
<p/>'' Dickon spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) as Ben Weatherstaff did, but Dickon's tone was one of friendly advice. '' Wheres`ever tha' puts it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it'll be all right.
<p/>Tha' knew how to build tha' nest before tha' came out o' th' egg. Get on with thee, lad. Tha`st got no time to lose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ben Weatherstaff scolds him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) and makes fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) hops about and looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) understood every word, and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) likes it.
<p/>'' Oh, I do like to hear you talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)!'' Mary said, laughing delightedly. '' Ben Weatherstaff says he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) is so conceited he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) would rather have stones thrown at him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) than not be noticed.
<p/>'' Dickon laughed too and went on talking. '' Tha' knows us won't trouble thee,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said to the robin. ''
<p/>Us is near bein' wild things ourselves. Us is nest-buildin' too, bless thee. Look out tha' doesn't tell on us. ''
<p/>And though the robin did not answer, because his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) beak was occupied, Mary knew that when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) flew away with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) twig to his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) own corner of the garden the darkness of his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) dew-bright eye meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) would not tell their secret for the world.
<p/>They found a great deal to do that morning and Mary was late in returning to the house and was also in such a hurry to get back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) work that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) quite forgot Colin until the last moment.
<p/>CHAPTER XVI <div class="bookquote">``I WON'T! ''  (<font color='red'><b>MARY</b></font>)</div>SAID MARY <div class="bookquote">``Tell Colin that I can't come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>MARY</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>MARY</b></font>) said to Martha.
<p/>'' I'm very busy in the garden. '' Martha looked rather frightened. '' Eh! Miss Mary,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it may put him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) all out of humor when I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) that.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But Mary was not as afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) as other people were and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not a self-sacrificing person. ''
<p/>I can't stay,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered. '' Dickon's waiting for me;'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran away. The afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning had been.
<p/>Already nearly all the weeds were cleared out of the garden and most of the roses and trees had been pruned or dug about.
<p/>Dickon had brought a spade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) own and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had taught Mary to use all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tools, so that by this time it was plain that though the lovely wild place was not likely to become a <div class="bookquote">``gardener's garden''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>it would be a wilderness of growing things before the springtime was over.
<p/>'' There'll be apple blossoms an' cherry blossoms overhead,'' Dickon said, working away with all his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) might. '' An' there'll be peach an' plum trees in bloom against th' walls, an' th' grass'll be a carpet o' flowers.
<p/>The little fox and the rook were as happy and busy as they were, and the robin and his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mate flew backward and forward like tiny streaks of lightning.
<p/>Each time he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) came back and perched near Dickon and cawed several times as if he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) were relating his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) adventures, and Dickon talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) just as he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had talked to the robin.
<p/>Once when Dickon was so busy that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) did not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) at first, Soot flew on to his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) shoulders and gently tweaked his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) ear with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) large beak.
<p/>When Mary wanted to rest a little Dickon sat down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) under a tree and once he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) pipe out of his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) pocket and played the soft strange little notes and two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened.
<p/>'' Sometimes the rook flapped his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) black wings and soared away over the tree-tops in the park. '' Tha's a good bit stronger than tha' was,'' Dickon said, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was digging.
<p/>'' Tha's beginning to look different, for sure. '' Mary was glowing with exercise and good spirits. '' I'm getting fatter and fatter every day,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said quite exultantly.
<p/>'' Mrs. Medlock will have to get me some bigger dresses. Martha says my hair is growing thicker. It isn't so flat and stringy.
<p/>'' The sun was beginning to set and sending deep gold-colored rays slanting under the trees when they parted. '' It'll be fine tomorrow,'' said Dickon.
<p/>'' I'll be at work by sunrise.'' <div class="bookquote">``So will I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran back to the house as quickly as her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feet would carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to tell Colin about Dickon's fox cub and the rook and about what the springtime had been doing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would like to hear.
<p/>So it was not very pleasant when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room, to see Martha standing waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) with a doleful face.
<p/>'' What is the matter? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) asked. '' What did Colin say when you told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) I couldn't come?'' <div class="bookquote">``Eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said Martha, <div class="bookquote">``I wish tha'd gone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was nigh goin' into one o' his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tantrums. There's been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) quiet.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was no more used to considering other people than Colin was and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) saw no reason why an ill-tempered boy should interfere with the thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) liked best.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knew nothing about the pitifulness of people who had been ill and nervous and who did not know that they could control their tempers and need not make other people ill and nervous, too.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had had a headache in India she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) best to see that everybody else also had a headache or something quite as bad.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would watch the clock all th' time. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>Mary's lips pinched themselves together. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was quite right; but of course now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt that Colin was quite wrong.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sofa when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was lying flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) back in bed
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came in. This was a bad beginning and Mary marched up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stiff manner.
<p/>'' Why didn't you get up? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' I did get up this morning when I thought you were coming,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered, without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>'' I made them put me back in bed this afternoon. My back ached and my head ached and I was tired.
<p/>Why didn't you come?'' <div class="bookquote">``I was working in the garden with Dickon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. Colin frowned and condescended to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>I won't let that boy come here if you go and stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) instead of coming to talk to me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Mary flew into a fine passion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could fly into a passion without making a noise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) just grew sour and obstinate and did not care what happened.
<p/>'' If you send Dickon away, I'll never come into this room again! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) retorted. '' You'll have to if I want you,'' said Colin.
<p/>'' I won't!'' said Mary. '' I'll make you,'' said Colin. '' They shall drag you in.'' '' Shall they, Mr. Rajah!
<p/>'' said Mary fiercely. '' They may drag me in but they can't make me talk when they get me here.
<p/>I'll sit and clench my teeth and never tell you one thing. I won't even look at you. I'll stare at the floor!
<p/>'' They were a nice agreeable pair as they glared at each other. If they had been two little street boys they would have sprung at each other and had a rough-and-tumble fight.
<p/>As it was, they did the next thing to it. '' You are a selfish thing!'' cried Colin. '' What are you?'' said Mary.
<p/>'' Selfish people always say that. Any one is selfish who doesn't do what they want. You're more selfish than I am.
<p/>You're the most selfish boy I ever saw. '' <div class="bookquote">``I'm not! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>snapped Colin. '' I'm not as selfish as your fine Dickon is!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) keeps you playing in the dirt when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knows I am all by myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s selfish, if you like!'' Mary's eyes flashed fire.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s nicer than any other boy that ever lived! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s --he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s like an angel! '' It might sound rather silly to say that
<p/>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not care. '' A nice angel!'' Colin sneered ferociously. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s a common cottage boy off the moor!''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s better than a common Rajah!'' retorted Mary. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s a thousand times better!'' Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was the stronger of the two she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was beginning to get the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>The truth was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had never had a fight with any one like himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) life and, upon the whole, it was rather good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), though neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) nor Mary knew anything about that.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pillow and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes and a big tear was squeezed out and ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>I'm not as selfish as you, because I'm always ill, and I'm sure there is a lump coming on my back,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was beginning to feel pathetic and sorry for himself--not for any one else. '' '' And I am going to die besides.
<p/>'' '' You're not! '' contradicted Mary unsympathetically. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes quite wide with indignation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had never heard such a thing said before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was at once furious and slightly pleased, if a person could be both at one time. '' I'm not? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried.
<p/>'' I am! You know I am! Everybody says so. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary sourly. '' You just say that to make people sorry.
<p/>I believe you're proud of it. I don't believe it! If you were a nice boy it might be true--but you're too nasty!''
<p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) invalid back Colin sat up in bed in quite a healthy rage. <div class="bookquote">``Get out of the room!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not strong enough to throw it far and it only fell at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feet, but Mary's face looked as pinched as a nutcracker.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) shouted and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) caught hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pillow and threw it at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' I'm going,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. ''
<p/>And I won't come back!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked to the door and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reached it she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned round and spoke again.
<p/>'' I was going to tell you all sorts of nice things,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' Dickon brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) fox and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) rook
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) marched out of the door and closed it behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and there to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) great astonishment she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found the trained nurse standing as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been listening and, more amazing still--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was laughing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a big handsome young woman who ought not to have been a trained nurse at all, as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) could not bear invalids and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was always making excuses to leave Colin to Martha or any one else who would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) place.
<p/>Mary had never liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) simply stood and gazed up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood giggling into her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) handkerchief..
<p/>and I was going to tell you all about them. Now I won't tell you a single thing!'' '' What are you laughing at?
<p/>It's the best thing that could happen to the sickly pampered thing to have some one to stand up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) that's as spoiled as himself;'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) laughed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) handkerchief again.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' At you two young ones,'' said the nurse. '' '' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'d had a young vixen of a sister to fight with it would have been the saving of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).''
<p/>'' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) going to die?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know and I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse. '' Hysterics and temper are half what ails him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>You'll find out if you work him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) into a tantrum after this--but at any rate you've given him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) something to have hysterics about, and I'm glad of it.
<p/>Mary went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) room not feeling at all as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had come in from the garden.
<p/>'' '' What are hysterics?'' asked Mary. '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was cross and disappointed but not at all sorry for Colin.
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had meant to try to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind whether it would be safe to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with the great secret.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had looked forward to telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) a great many things She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been beginning to think it would be, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind entirely.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would never tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could stay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room and never get any fresh air and die if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) liked!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt so sour and unrelenting that for a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) almost forgot about Dickon and the green veil creeping over the world and the soft wind blowing down from the moor.
<p/>It would serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) right! Martha was waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and the trouble in her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) face had been temporarily replaced by interest and curiosity.
<p/>There was a wooden box on the table and its cover had been removed and revealed that it was full of neat packages.
<p/>'' Mr. Craven sent it to you,'' said Martha. '' It looks as if it had picture-books in it. '' Mary remembered what he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opened the package wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had sent a doll, and also wondering what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should do with it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had.
<p/>There were several beautiful books such as Colin had, and two of them were about gardens and were full of pictures.
<p/>There were two or three games and there was a beautiful little writing-case with a gold monogram on it and a gold pen and inkstand.
<p/>'' Do you want anything--dolls--toys--books? '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had not sent one. Everything was so nice that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pleasure began to crowd her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) anger out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind.
<p/>I can write better than I can print,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and the first thing I shall write with that pen will be a letter to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) I am much obliged.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been friends with Colin she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have run to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) presents at once, and they would have looked at the pictures and read some of the gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would have enjoyed himself so much he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would never once have thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was going to die or have put his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spine to see if there was a lump coming.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) to remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at all and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hard little heart grew quite warm. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had a way of doing that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not bear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt even quite a little lump some day he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) should know his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hunch had begun to grow.
<p/>Something he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had heard Mrs. Medlock whispering to the nurse had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) the idea and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock had said his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) father's back had begun to show its crookedness in that way when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was a child.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had never told any one but Mary that most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``tantrums''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>as they called them grew out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hysterical hidden fear.
<p/>It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) an uncomfortable frightened feeling because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) always looked so frightened himself. Mary had been sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) always began to think about it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was cross or tired,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to herself. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) has been cross today.
<p/>Perhaps--perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) has been thinking about it all afternoon. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood still, looking down at the carpet and thinking. ''
<p/>I said I would never go back again-- '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hesitated, knitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brows--<div class="bookquote">``but perhaps, just perhaps, I will go and see--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wants me--in the morning.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'ll try to throw his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pillow at me again, but-- I think--I'll go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XVII A TANTRUM She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had got up very early in the morning and had worked hard in the garden
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was tired and sleepy, so as soon as Martha had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) supper and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had eaten it , she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was glad to go to bed.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) head on the pillow she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) murmured to herself: <div class="bookquote">``I'll go out before breakfast and work with Dickon and then afterward--I believe--I'll go to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) thought it was the middle of the night when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was awakened by such dreadful sounds that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) jumped out of bed in an instant.
<p/>Doors were opened and shut and there were hurrying feet in the corridors and some one was crying and screaming at the same time, screaming and crying in a horrible way.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>What was it--what was it? The next minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) felt quite sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) knew. '' It's Colin,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) said. ''
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) listened to the sobbing screams she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) did not wonder that people were so frightened that they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) own way in everything rather than hear them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s having one of those tantrums the nurse called hysterics. How awful it sounds. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) ears and felt sick and shivering.
<p/>'' I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) kept saying. '' I can't bear it.
<p/>and then she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had driven her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) out of the room and thought that perhaps the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) might make him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) worse.
<p/>'' Once she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would stop if she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) dared go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) Even when she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) hands more tightly over her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) ears she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) could not keep the awful sounds out.
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) should like to fly into a tantrum herself and frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was frightening her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) hated them so and was so terrified by them that suddenly they began to make her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) angry She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was not used to any one's tempers but her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) own.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) hands from her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) ears and sprang up and stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) foot. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) ought to be stopped! Somebody ought to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stop!
<p/>Somebody ought to beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) cried out. Just then she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) heard feet almost running down the corridor and her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) door opened and the nurse came in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was not laughing now by any means. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) even looked rather pale. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s worked himself into hysterics,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said in a great hurry.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'ll do himself harm. No one can do anything with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). You come and try, like a good child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) likes you.''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) turned me out of the room this morning,'' said Mary, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) foot with excitement. The stamp rather pleased the nurse.
<p/>The truth was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might find Mary crying and hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head under the bed-clothes. ''
<p/>That's right,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' You're in the right humor. You go and scold him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) something new to think of.
<p/>It was not until afterward that Mary realized that the thing had been funny as well as dreadful--that it was funny that all the grown-up people were so frightened that they came to a little girl just because they guessed she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was almost as bad as Colin himself.
<p/>Do go, child, as quick as ever you can. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flew along the corridor and the nearer she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) got to the screams the higher her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) temper mounted.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt quite wicked by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reached the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slapped it open with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand and ran across the room to the four-posted bed.
<p/>'' You stop! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) almost shouted. '' You stop! I hate you! Everybody hates you! I wish everybody would run out of the house and let you scream yourself to death!
<p/>A nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor said such things, but it just happened that the shock of hearing them was the best possible thing for this hysterical boy whom no one had ever dared to restrain or contradict.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face beating his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pillow with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) actually almost jumped around, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned so quickly at the sound of the furious little voice.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face looked dreadful, white and red and swollen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was gasping and choking; but savage little Mary did not care an atom.
<p/>If you scream another scream,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll scream too--and I can scream louder than you can and I'll frighten you, I'll frighten you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>You will scream yourself to death in a minute, and I wish you would! '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) actually had stopped screaming because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had startled him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) so.
<p/>The scream which had been coming almost choked him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). The tears were streaming down his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shook all over.
<p/>'' I can't stop! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gasped and sobbed. '' I can't-- I can't!'' <div class="bookquote">``You can!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>shouted Mary. '' Half that ails you is hysterics and temper--just hysterics--hysterics--hysterics!''
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stamped each time she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said it. '' I felt the lump--I felt it,'' choked out Colin. '' I knew I should.
<p/>I shall have a hunch on my back and then I shall die,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to writhe again and turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face and sobbed and wailed
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) didn't scream. '' You didn't feel a lump! '' contradicted Mary fiercely. '' If you did it was only a hysterical lump.
<p/>Hysterics makes lumps. There's nothing the matter with your horrid back--nothing but hysterics! Turn over and let me look at it!''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked the word <div class="bookquote">``hysterics''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and felt somehow as if it had an effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was probably like herself and had never heard it before.
<p/>The nurse, Mrs. Medlock and Martha had been standing huddled together near the door staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), their mouths half open.
<p/>'' Nurse,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) commanded, <div class="bookquote">``come here and show me his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) back this minute! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>All three had gasped with fright more than once.
<p/>The nurse came forward as if she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) were half afraid. Colin was heaving with great breathless sobs. '' Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) won't let me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) hesitated in a low voice.
<p/>Colin heard her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), however, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) gasped out between two sobs: <div class="bookquote">``Sh-show her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)! She-she'll see then! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was a poor thin back to look at when it was bared.
<p/>Every rib could be counted and every joint of the spine, though Mistress Mary did not count them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bent over and examined them with a solemn savage little face.
<p/>There was just a minute's silence, for even Colin tried to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) breath while Mary looked up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spine, and down and up, as intently as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been the great doctor from London.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked so sour and old-fashioned that the nurse turned her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) head aside to hide the twitching of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) mouth. ''
<p/>There's not a single lump there! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said at last. '' There's not a lump as big as a pin--except backbone lumps, and you can only feel them because you're thin.
<p/>I've got backbone lumps myself, and they used to stick out as much as yours do, until I began to get fatter, and I am not fat enough yet to hide them.
<p/>There's not a lump as big as a pin! If you ever say there is again, I shall laugh! '' No one
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had ever had any one to talk to about his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) secret terrors--if he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had ever dared to let himself ask questions--if he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had had childish companions and had not lain on his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) back in the huge closed house, breathing an atmosphere heavy with the fears of people who were most of them ignorant and tired of him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would have found out that most of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) fright and illness was created by himself.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had lain and thought of himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) aches and weariness for hours and days and months and years.
<p/>And now that an angry unsympathetic little girl insisted obstinately that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was not as ill as he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was
<p/>but Colin himself knew what effect those crossly spoken childish words had on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) actually felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might be speaking the truth.
<p/>'' I didn't know,'' ventured the nurse, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had a lump on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spine. His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) back is weak because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) won't try to sit up.
<p/>I could have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) there was no lump there.''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>Colin gulped and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face a little to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).
<p/>Colin turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face again and but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) long-drawn broken breaths, which were the dying down of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) storm of sobbing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lay still for a minute, though great tears streamed down his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face and wet the pillow.
<p/>'' C-could you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said pathetically. '' Yes, sir. '' <div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gulped too. Actually the tears meant that a curious great relief had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) turned and looked at the nurse again and strangely enough he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not like a Rajah at all as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).
<p/>'' Do you think--I could--live to grow up? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. The nurse was neither clever nor soft-hearted but she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) could repeat some of the London doctor's words.
<p/>You probably will if you will do what you are told to do and not give way to your temper, and stay out a great deal in the fresh air.
<p/>'' '' Colin's tantrum had passed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was weak and worn out with crying and this perhaps made him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feel gentle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand a little toward Mary, and I am glad to say that, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own tantum having passed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was softened too and met him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) half-way with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand, so that it was a sort of making up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) remembered just in time to stop himself from saying <div class="bookquote">``if we can find the secret garden''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) ended, ``I shall like to go out with you if Dickon will come and push my chair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll-- I'll go out with you, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' I shan't hate fresh air if we can find--'' I do so want to see Dickon and the fox and the crow.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made Colin a cup of beef tea and gave a cup to Mary, who really was very glad to get it after her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) excitement.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock and Martha gladly slipped away, and after everything was neat and calm and in order the nurse looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would very gladly slip away also.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was a healthy young woman who resented being robbed of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) sleep and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) yawned quite openly as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) looked at Mary, who had pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) big footstool close to the four-posted bed and was holding Colin's hand.
<p/>'' The nurse remade the tumbled bed and shook and straightened the pillows. '' You must go back and get your sleep out,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'ll drop off after a while--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s not too upset. Then I'll lie down myself in the next room. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like me to sing you that song I learned from my Ayah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary whispered to Colin. His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand pulled hers gently and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tired eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) appealingly.
<p/>'' Oh, yes!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered. '' It's such a soft song. I shall go to sleep in a minute. '' <div class="bookquote">``I will put him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) to sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary said to the yawning nurse.
<p/>'' You can go if you like.'' '' Well,'' said the nurse, with an attempt at reluctance. '' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) doesn't go to sleep in half an hour you must call me.''
<p/>The nurse was out of the room in a minute and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was gone Colin pulled Mary's hand again.
<p/>I won't talk and I'll go to sleep, but you said you had a whole lot of nice things to tell me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary. '' I almost told,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but I stopped myself in time. Have you--do you think you have found out anything at all about the way into the secret garden?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mary looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) poor little tired face and swollen eyes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart relented. '' Ye-es,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I think I have.
<p/>And if you will go to sleep I will tell you tomorrow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand quite trembled. '' Oh, Mary! ''
<p/>Do you suppose that instead of singing the Ayah song--you could just tell me softly as you did that first day what you imagine it looks like inside?
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' Oh, Mary! If I could get into it I think I should live to grow up! I am sure it will make me go to sleep.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary. '' Shut your eyes. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes and lay quite still and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand and began to speak very slowly and in a very low voice.
<p/>I think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbed until they hang from the branches and walls and creep over the ground--almost like a strange gray mist.
<p/>Some of them have died but many--are alive and when the summer comes there will be curtains and fountains of roses.
<p/>I think the ground is full of daffodils and snowdrops and lilies and iris working their way out of the dark.
<p/>Now the spring has begun--perhaps--perhaps--'' The soft drone of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) voice was making him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stiller and stiller and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) saw it and went on.
<p/>'' I think it has been left alone so long--that it has grown all into a lovely tangle. '' Perhaps they are coming up through the grass--perhaps there are clusters of purple crocuses and gold ones--even now.
<p/>Perhaps the leaves are beginning to break out and uncurl--and perhaps--the gray is changing and a green gauze veil is creeping--and creeping over--everything.
<p/>And the birds are coming to look at it--because it is--so safe and still. And perhaps--perhaps--perhaps--'' very softly and slowly indeed, <div class="bookquote">``the robin has found a mate--and is building a nest.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>And Colin was asleep. CHAPTER XVIII <div class="bookquote">``THA' MUNNOT WASTE NO TIME ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Of course Mary did not waken early the next morning.
<p/>Colin was quite quiet he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was ill and feverish as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) always was after he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had worn himself out with a fit of crying.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) slept late because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was tired, and when Martha brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) that though. Mary ate her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breakfast slowly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) listened.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wishes tha' would please go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) as soon as tha' can,'' Martha said. '' It's queer what a fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s took to thee.
<p/>Tha' did give it him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) last night for sure-- didn't tha? Nobody else would have dared to do it. Eh! poor lad!
<p/>Mother says as th' two worst things as can happen to a child is never to have his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own way--or always to have it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s been spoiled till salt won't save him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) doesn't know which is th' worst. Tha' was in a fine temper tha`self, too.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) says to me when I went into his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) room, `Please ask Miss Mary if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'ll please come an' talk to me?'
<p/>Think o' him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) saying please! Will you go, Miss?'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll run and see Dickon first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' No, I'll go and see Colin first and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)--I know what I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>),'' with a sudden inspiration.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hat on when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) appeared in Colin's room and for a second he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked disappointed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was in bed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face was pitifully white and there were dark circles round his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes. '' I'm glad you came,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. ''
<p/>My head aches and I ache all over because I'm so tired. Are you going somewhere? '' Mary went and leaned against his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) bed.
<p/>'' I won't be long,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' I'm going to Dickon, but I'll come back. Colin, it's--it's something about the garden.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) whole face brightened and a little color came into it. '' Oh! is it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried out. ''
<p/>I dreamed about it all night I heard you say something about gray changing into green, and I dreamed I was standing in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves--and there were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still.
<p/>I'll lie and think about it until you come back. '' In five minutes Mary was with Dickon in their garden.
<p/>The fox and the crow were with him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) again and this time he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) had brought two tame squirrels. '' I came over on the pony this mornin','' he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Eh! he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) is a good little chap--Jump is! I brought these two in my pockets. This here one he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>)'s called Nut an' this here other one's called Shell.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Nut''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>one squirrel leaped on to his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) right shoulder and when he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Shell''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the other one leaped on to his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) left shoulder.
<p/>When they sat down on the grass with Captain curled at their feet, Soot solemnly listening on a tree and Nut and Shell nosing about close to them, it seemed to Mary that it would be scarcely bearable to leave such delightfulness, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) story somehow
<p/>'' the look in Dickon's funny face gradually changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) felt sorrier for Colin than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked up at the sky and all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). '' Just listen to them birds--th' world seems full of 'em--all whistlin' an' pipin','' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Look at 'em dartin' about, an' hearken at 'em callin' to each other. Come springtime seems like as if all th' world's callin'.
<p/>The leaves is uncurlin' so you can see 'em--an', my word, th' nice smells there is about!'' sniffing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) happy turned-up nose.
<p/>'' An' that poor lad lyin' shut up an' seein' so little that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) gets to thinkin ' o' things as sets him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) screamin'.
<p/>Eh! my! we mun get him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) out here --we mun get him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) watchin' an listenin' an' sniffin' up th' air an' get him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) just soaked through wi' sunshine.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was very much interested he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) often spoke quite broad Yorkshire though at other times he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tried to modify his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dialect so that Mary could better understand.
<p/>An' we munnot lose no time about it. '' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) broad Yorkshire and had in fact been trying to learn to speak it herself.
<p/>I'll tell thee what us'll do first,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) proceeded, and Dickon grinned, because when the little wench tried to twist her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tongue into speaking Yorkshire it amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) very much.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke a little now. '' Aye, that we mun,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said -LRB-which meant <div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, we must'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-RRB-. '' ''
<p/>When I go back to the house to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) I'll ax him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) if tha' canna' come an' see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tomorrow
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s took a graidely fancy to thee. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wants to see thee and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wants to see Soot an' Captain. mornin'--an'.
<p/>bring tha' creatures wi' thee--an' then--in a bit, when there's more leaves out, an' happen a bud or two, we'll get him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to come out an' tha' shall push him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) chair
<p/>an' we'll bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) here an' show him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) everything. '' When she (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stopped she (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was quite proud of herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had never made a long speech in Yorkshire before and she (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had remembered very well.
<p/>'' Tha' mun talk a bit o ' Yorkshire like that to Mester Colin,'' Dickon chuckled. <div class="bookquote">``Tha'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) laugh an' there's nowt as good for ill folk as laughin' is.
<p/>Mother says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) believes as half a hour's good laugh every mornin' `ud cure a chap as was makin' ready for typhus fever.
<p/>The garden had reached the time when every day and every night it seemed as if Magicians were passing through it drawing loveliness out of the earth and the boughs with wands.
<p/>It was hard to go away and leave it all, particularly as Nut had actually crept on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) dress and Shell had scrambled down the trunk of the apple-tree they sat under and stayed there looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) with inquiring eyes.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) went back to the house and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) sat down close to Colin's bed he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to sniff as Dickon did though not in such an experienced way.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I'm going to talk Yorkshire to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) this very day,'' said Mary, chuckling herself. '' You smell like flowers and--and fresh things,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried out quite joyously.
<p/>'' What is it you smell of? It's cool and warm and sweet all at the same time. '' '' It's th' wind from th' moor,'' said Mary.
<p/>'' It comes o' sittin' on th' grass under a tree wi' Dickon an' wi' Captain an' Soot an' Nut an' Shell.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said it as broadly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could, and you do not know how broadly Yorkshire sounds until you have heard some one speak it.
<p/>It's th' springtime an' out o' doors an' sunshine as smells so graidely. '' Colin began to laugh. '' What are you doing?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' I never heard you talk like that before. How funny it sounds. '' <div class="bookquote">``I'm givin' thee a bit o
<p/>' Yorkshire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary triumphantly. '' I canna' talk as graidely as Dickon an' Martha can but tha' sees I can shape a bit.
<p/>Doesn't tha' understand a bit o' Yorkshire when tha' hears it? An' tha' a Yorkshire lad thysel' bred an' born! Eh!
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) began to laugh too and they both laughed until they could not stop themselves and they laughed until the room echoed and Mrs. Medlock opening the door to come in drew back into the corridor and stood listening amazed.
<p/>I wonder tha`rt not ashamed o' thy face. '' '' Well, upon my word! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said, speaking rather broad Yorkshire herself because there was no one to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was so astonished. '' Whoever heard th' like! Whoever on earth would ha' thought it! '' There was so much to talk about.
<p/>It seemed as if Colin could never hear enough of Dickon and Captain and Soot and Nut and Shell and the pony whose name was Jump.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was a tiny little shaggy moor pony with thick locks hanging over his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) eyes and with a pretty face and a nuzzling velvet nose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was rather thin with living on moor grass but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was as tough and wiry as if the muscle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) little legs had been made of steel springs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) head and whinnied softly the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) saw Dickon and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had trotted up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) head across his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) shoulder
<p/>Mary had run round into the wood with Dickon to see Jump. and then Dickon had talked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ear and Jump had talked back in odd little whinnies and puffs and snorts.
<p/>Dickon had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) give Mary his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) small front hoof and kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cheek with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) velvet muzzle. ''
<p/>Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) really understand everything Dickon says?'' Colin asked. '' It seems as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) does,'' answered Mary. '' Dickon says anything will understand if you're friends with it for sure, but you have to be friends for sure.
<p/>Colin lay quiet a little while and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strange gray eyes seemed to be staring at the wall, but Mary saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was thinking.
<p/>'' '' I wish I was friends with things,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``but I'm not. I never had anything to be friends with, and I can't bear people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you bear me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary. '' Yes, I can,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered. '' It's funny but I even like you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'d warrant we'd both got the same nasty tempers. I think you are like him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) too. We are all three alike--you and I and Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said we were neither of us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked. But I don't feel as sour as I used to before I knew the robin and Dickon.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Did you feel as if you hated people?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>answered Mary without any affectation. '' I should have detested you if I had seen you before I saw the robin and Dickon.
<p/>'' Colin put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thin hand and touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' Mary,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I wish I hadn't said what I did about sending Dickon away.
<p/>I hated you when you said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was like an angel and I laughed at you but-- but perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) is.
<p/>Well, it was rather funny to say it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) admitted frankly, <div class="bookquote">``because his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) nose does turn up and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) has a big mouth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) clothes have patches all over them and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) talks broad Yorkshire,
<p/>--I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'d understand the green things and know how to make them grow and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would know how to talk to the wild creatures as Dickon does
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' but--but if an angel did come to Yorkshire and live on the moor--if there was a Yorkshire angel and they'd know he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) was friends for sure.
<p/>I'm glad you said that,'' answered Mary, <div class="bookquote">``because--because--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Quite suddenly it came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind that this was the minute to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>).
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't mind Dickon looking at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin; <div class="bookquote">``I want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>'' Colin knew something new was coming.
<p/>Mary was so anxious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stool and came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and caught hold of both his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hands.
<p/>'' Because what? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried eagerly. '' Can I trust you? I trusted Dickon because birds trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). Can I trust you--for sure--for sure?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) implored. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face was so solemn that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) almost whispered his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answer. '' Yes--yes!'' '' Well, Dickon will come to see you tomorrow morning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'ll bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) creatures with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).''
<p/>'' Oh! Oh!'' Colin cried out in delight. '' But that's not all,'' Mary went on, almost pale with solemn excitement.
<p/>'' The rest is better. There is a door into the garden. I found it. It is under the ivy on the wall.
<p/>'' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been a strong healthy boy Colin would probably have shouted <div class="bookquote">``Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was weak and rather hysterical; his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes grew bigger and bigger and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) gasped for breath.
<p/>'' Oh! Mary! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried out with a half sob. '' Shall I see it? Shall I get into it?
<p/>Shall I live to get into it?'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) clutched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands and dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). '' Of course you'll see it!'' snapped Mary indignantly.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was so un-hysterical and natural and childish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) senses and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to laugh at himself and a few minutes afterward
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was sitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stool again telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) not what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) imagined the secret garden to be like but what it really was, and Colin's aches and tiredness were forgotten
<p/>'' Of course you'll live to get into it! Don't be silly!'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was listening enraptured. '' It is just what you thought it would be,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said at last.
<p/>'' It sounds just as if you had really seen it. You know I said that when you told me first.
<p/>'' Mary hesitated about two minutes and then boldly spoke the truth. '' I had seen it--and I had been in,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I found the key and got in weeks ago. But I daren't tell you-- I daren't because I was so afraid I couldn't trust you--for sure!''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was always sent for at once when such a thing occurred and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) always found, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) arrived, a white shaken boy lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) bed, sulky and still so hysterical that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was ready to break into fresh sobbing at the least word.
<p/>In fact, Dr. Craven dreaded and detested the difficulties of these visits. On this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was away from Misselthwaite Manor until afternoon.
<p/>'' How is he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) asked Mrs. Medlock rather irritably when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) arrived. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) will break a blood-vessel in one of those fits some day.
<p/>The boy is half insane with hysteria and self-indulgence.'' '' Well, sir,'' answered Mrs. Medlock, <div class="bookquote">``you'll scarcely believe your eyes when you see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>That plain sour-faced child that's almost as bad as himself has just bewitched him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). How she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'s done it there's no telling.
<p/>The Lord knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'s nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) speak, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) did what none of us dare do.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) just flew at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) like a little cat last night, and stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) feet and ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to stop screaming, and somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) actually did stop, and this afternoon--well just come up and see, sir.
<p/>It's past crediting. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>The scene which Dr. Craven beheld when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) patient's room was indeed rather astonishing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/>Colin was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sofa in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dressing-gown and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was sitting up quite straight looking at a picture in one of the garden books and talking to the plain child who at that moment could scarcely be called plain at all because her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) face was so glowing with enjoyment.
<p/>As Mrs. Medlock opened the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) heard laughing and chattering. '' Those long spires of blue ones-- we'll have a lot of those,'' Colin was announcing.
<p/>'' They're called Del-phin-iums.'' <div class="bookquote">``Dickon says they're larkspurs made big and grand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mistress</b></font>)</div>cried Mistress Mary. '' There are clumps there already.
<p/>'' Then they saw Dr. Craven and stopped. Mary became quite still and Colin looked fretful. '' I am sorry to hear you were ill last night, my boy,'' Dr. Craven said a trifle nervously.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was rather a nervous man. '' I'm better now--much better,'' Colin answered, rather like a Rajah. '' I'm going out in my chair in a day or two if it is fine.
<p/>I want some fresh air. '' Dr. Craven sat down by him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) pulse and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) curiously.
<p/>'' It must be a very fine day,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and you must be very careful not to tire yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fresh air won't tire me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rajah</b></font>)</div>said the young Rajah.
<p/>As there had been occasions when this same young gentleman had shrieked aloud with rage and had insisted that fresh air would give him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cold and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), it is not to be wondered at that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) doctor felt somewhat startled.
<p/>'' I thought you did not like fresh air,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said. '' I don't when I am by myself,'' replied the Rajah; <div class="bookquote">``but my cousin is going out with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Rajah</b></font>)</div><p/>No, I will not have the nurse,'' so magnificently that Mary could not help remembering how the young native Prince had looked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) diamonds and emeralds and pearls stuck all over him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) and the great rubies on the small dark hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) had waved to command his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) servants to approach with salaams and receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) orders.
<p/>'' And the nurse, of course?'' suggested Dr. Craven. '' '' My cousin knows how to take care of me. I am always better when she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) is with me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) made me better last night. A very strong boy I know will push my carriage. '' Dr. Craven felt rather alarmed.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) himself would lose all chance of inheriting Misselthwaite; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was not an unscrupulous man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was a weak one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) did not intend to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) run into actual danger.
<p/>If this tiresome hysterical boy should chance to get well '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must be a strong boy and a steady boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' And I must know something about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? What is his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name?'' '' It's Dickon,'' Mary spoke up suddenly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt somehow that everybody who knew the moor must know Dickon. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was right, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw that in a moment Dr. Craven's serious face relaxed into a relieved smile.
<p/>'' Oh, Dickon,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said. '' If it is Dickon you will be safe enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s as strong as a moor pony, is Dickon.''
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s trusty,'' said Mary. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s th' trustiest lad i' Yorkshire. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been talking Yorkshire to Colin and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) forgot herself.
<p/>'' Did Dickon teach you that?'' asked Dr. Craven, laughing outright. '' I'm learning it as if it was French,'' said Mary rather coldly.
<p/>'' It's like a native dialect in India. Very clever people try to learn them. I like it and so does Colin.''
<p/>'' Well, well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' If it amuses you perhaps it won't do you any harm. Did you take your bromide last night, Colin?''
<p/>'' No,'' Colin answered. '' I wouldn't take it at first and after Mary made me quiet she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) talked me to sleep--in a low voice--about the spring creeping into a garden.''
<p/>That sounds soothing,'' said Dr. Craven, more perplexed than ever and glancing sideways at Mistress Mary sitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stool and looking down silently at the carpet.
<p/>'' '' You are evidently better, but you must remember--'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rajah</b></font>)</div>interrupted the Rajah, appearing again. ''
<p/>When I lie by myself and remember I begin to have pains everywhere and I think of things that make me begin to scream because I hate them so.
<p/>If there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget you were ill instead of remembering it I would have him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brought here.
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) waved a thin hand which ought really to have been covered with royal signet rings made of rubies.
<p/>Dr. Craven had never made such a short stay after a <div class="bookquote">``tantrum'' (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>; usually he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was obliged to remain a very long time and do a great many things.
<p/>'' It is because my cousin makes me forget that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) makes me better. '' This afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) did not give any medicine or leave any new orders and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was spared any disagreeable scenes.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) went downstairs he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) looked very thoughtful and when he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) talked to Mrs. Medlock in the library she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was a much puzzled man.
<p/>'' Well, sir,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) ventured, <div class="bookquote">``could you have believed it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is certainly a new state of affairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.
<p/>'' And there's no denying it is better than the old one.'' <div class="bookquote">``I believe Susan Sowerby's right-- I do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) says to me, `Well, Sarah Ann, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) mayn't be a good child, an' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) mayn't be a pretty one, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>)'s a child, an' children needs children.'
<p/>'' I stopped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) cottage on my way to Thwaite yesterday and had a bit of talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>). We went to school together, Susan Sowerby and me.''
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>)'s the best sick nurse I know,'' said Dr. Craven. '' When I find her (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) in a cottage I know the chances are that I shall save my patient.
<p/>'' Mrs. Medlock smiled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was fond of Susan Sowerby. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'s got a way with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), has Susan,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) went on quite volubly.
<p/>'' I've been thinking all morning of one thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said yesterday. She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) says, `Once when I was givin' th' children a bit of a preach after they'd been fightin'
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I was at school my jography told as th' world was shaped like a orange an' I found out before I was ten that th' whole orange doesn't belong to nobody.
<p/>No one owns more than his (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) bit of a quarter an' there's times it seems like there's not enow quarters to go round.
<p/>But don't you--none o' you--think as you own th' whole orange or you'll find out you're mistaken, an' you won't find it out without hard knocks.
<p/>I ses to 'em all, ''  (<font color='red'><b>givin th children bit</b></font>)</div>`What children learns from children,' she (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) says, `is that there's no sense in grabbin' at th' whole orange--peel an' all.
<p/>If you do you'll likely not get even th' pips, an' them's too bitter to eat.' '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>)'s a shrewd woman,'' said Dr. Craven, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) coat.
<p/>'' Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>)'s got a way of saying things,'' ended Mrs. Medlock, much pleased. '' Sometimes I've said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>), `Eh!
<p/>Susan, if you was a different woman an' didn't talk such broad Yorkshire I've seen the times when I should have said you was clever.'
<p/>That night Colin slept without once awakening and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes in the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lay still and smiled without knowing it--smiled because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt so curiously comfortable.
<p/>'' It was actually nice to be awake, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) turned over and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) limbs luxuriously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt as if tight strings which had held him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had loosened themselves and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) go.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not know that Dr. Craven would have said that his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) nerves had relaxed and rested themselves. Instead of lying and staring at the wall and wishing
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had not awakened, his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) mind was full of the plans he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) and Mary had made yesterday, of pictures of the garden and of Dickon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wild creatures.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had not been awake more than ten minutes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) heard feet running along the corridor and Mary was at the door.
<p/>The next minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in the room and had run across to his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) bed, bringing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a waft of fresh air full of the scent of the morning.
<p/>It was so nice to have things to think about. '' You've been out! You've been out! There's that nice smell of leaves!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been running and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hair was loose and blown and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was bright with the air and pink-cheeked, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) could not see it.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) cried. '' It's so beautiful! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, a little breathless with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) speed. '' You never saw anything so beautiful!
<p/>It has come! I thought it had come that other morning, but it was only coming. It is here now! It has come, the Spring!
<p/>Dickon says so!'' <div class="bookquote">``Has it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div>cried Colin, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) really knew nothing about it he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) heart beat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) actually sat up in bed. <div class="bookquote">``Open the window!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) added, laughing half with joyful excitement and half at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) own fancy.
<p/>And though he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) laughed, Mary was at the window in a moment and in a moment more it was opened wide and freshness and softness and scents and birds' songs were pouring through.
<p/>'' Perhaps we may hear golden trumpets!'' '' That's fresh air,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' Lie on your back and draw in long breaths of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feels it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) veins and it makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strong and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feels as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could live forever and ever.
<p/>That's what Dickon does when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s lying on the moor. Breathe it and breathe it. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was only repeating what Dickon had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) caught Colin's fancy.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), drawing in long deep breaths over and over again until he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt that something quite new and delightful was happening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>''' Forever and ever'! Does it make him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feel like that? '' Mary was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) bedside again. '' Things are crowding up out of the earth,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran on in a hurry.
<p/>And there are flowers uncurling and buds on everything and the green veil has covered nearly all the gray and the birds are in such a hurry about their nests for fear they may be too late that some of them are even fighting for places in the secret garden.
<p/>can be, and there are primroses in the lanes and woods, and the seeds we planted are up, and Dickon has brought the fox and the crow and the squirrels and a new-born lamb.
<p/>The new-born lamb Dickon had found three days before lying by its dead mother among the gorse bushes on the moor.
<p/>'' And the rose-bushes look as wick as wick '' And then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) paused for breath. It was not the first motherless lamb he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) had found and he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) knew what to do with it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) had taken it to the cottage wrapped in his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) jacket and he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) had let it lie near the fire and had fed it with warm milk.
<p/>Dickon had carried it over the moor in his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) arms and its feeding bottle was in his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) pocket with a squirrel, and when Mary had sat under a tree with its limp warmness huddled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lap she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were too full of strange joy to speak.
<p/>It was a soft thing with a darling silly baby face and legs rather long for its body. A lamb--a lamb!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was describing it with great joy and Colin was listening and drawing in long breaths of air when the nurse entered.
<p/>A living lamb who lay on your lap like a baby! She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) started a little at the sight of the open window.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had sat stifling in the room many a warm day because her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) patient was sure that open windows gave people cold.
<p/>'' Are you sure you are not chilly, Master Colin? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) inquired. '' No,'' was the answer. '' I am breathing long breaths of fresh air.
<p/>It makes you strong. I am going to get up to the sofa for breakfast. My cousin will have breakfast with me.
<p/>'' The nurse went away, concealing a smile, to give the order for two breakfasts. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) found the servants' hall a more amusing place than the invalid's chamber
<p/>There was a great deal of joking about the unpopular young recluse who, as the cook said, ``had found his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) master, and good for him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>).
<p/>The servants' hall had been very tired of the tantrums, and the butler, who was a man with a family, had more than once expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) opinion that the invalid would be all the better <div class="bookquote">``for a good hiding.
<p/>When Colin was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sofa and the breakfast for two was put upon the table he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) made an announcement to the nurse in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) most Rajah-like manner.
<p/>A boy, and a fox, and a crow, and two squirrels, and a new-born lamb, are coming to see me this morning.
<p/>and just now everybody wanted to hear the news from upstairs. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a family</b></font>)</div>'' '' I want them brought upstairs as soon as they come,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' You are not to begin playing with the animals in the servants' hall and keep them there. I want them here.
<p/>'' The nurse gave a slight gasp and tried to conceal it with a cough. '' Yes, sir,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) answered. ''
<p/>I'll tell you what you can do,'' added Colin, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand. '' You can tell Martha to bring them here.
<p/>The boy is Martha's brother. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name is Dickon and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is an animal charmer.'' <div class="bookquote">``I hope the animals won't bite, Master Colin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse.
<p/>'' I told you he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was a charmer,'' said Colin austerely. '' Charmers' animals never bite. '' '' There are snake-charmers in India,'' said Mary.
<p/>'' And they can put their snakes' heads in their mouths.'' <div class="bookquote">``Goodness! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>shuddered the nurse. They ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring in upon them.
<p/>Colin's breakfast was a very good one and Mary watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with serious interest. '' You will begin to get fatter just as I did,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I never wanted my breakfast when I was in India and now I always want it. '' <div class="bookquote">``I wanted mine this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/>'' Perhaps it was the fresh air. When do you think Dickon will come? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not long in coming.
<p/>In about ten minutes Mary held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Listen! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' Did you hear a caw?'' Colin listened and heard it, the oddest sound in the world to hear inside a house, a hoarse <div class="bookquote">``caw-caw.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered. '' That's Soot,'' said Mary. <div class="bookquote">``Listen again. Do you hear a bleat--a tiny one?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, yes!
<p/>Dickon's moorland boots were thick and clumsy and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tried to walk quietly they made a clumping sound as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) walked through the long corridors.
<p/>Mary and Colin heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) marching--marching, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) passed through the tapestry door on to the soft carpet of Colin's own passage.
<p/>'' cried Colin, quite flushing. '' That's the new-born lamb,'' said Mary. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s coming. '' '' If you please, sir,'' announced Martha, opening the door, <div class="bookquote">``if you please, sir, here's Dickon
<p/>an' his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) creatures. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>Dickon came in smiling his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) nicest wide smile. The new-born lamb was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) arms and the little red fox trotted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) side.
<p/>Nut sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) left shoulder and Soot on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) right and Shell's head and paws peeped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) coat pocket.
<p/>Colin slowly sat up and stared and stared--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had stared when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) first saw Mary; but this was a stare of wonder and delight.
<p/>The truth was that in spite of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had not in the least understood what this boy would be like and that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fox and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) crow and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) squirrels and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lamb were so near to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) friendliness that they seemed almost to be part of himself.
<p/>Colin had never talked to a boy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) life and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was so overwhelmed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) own pleasure and curiosity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not even think of speaking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had not felt embarrassed because the crow had not known his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) language and had only stared and had not spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) the first time they met.
<p/>But Dickon did not feel the least shy or awkward. Creatures were always like that until they found out about you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) walked over to Colin's sofa and put the new-born lamb quietly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lap, and immediately the little creature turned to the warm velvet dressing-gown and began to nuzzle and nuzzle into its folds and butt its tight-curled head with soft impatience against his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) side.
<p/>Of course no boy could have helped speaking then. '' What is it doing? '' cried Colin. '' What does it want?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wants its mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon, smiling more and more. '' I brought it to thee a bit hungry because I knowed tha'd like to see it feed.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knelt down by the sofa and took a feeding-bottle from his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Come on, little `un,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, turning the small woolly white head with a gentle brown hand.
<p/>There now,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pushed the rubber tip of the bottle into the nuzzling mouth and the lamb began to suck it with ravenous ecstasy.
<p/>'' This is what tha's after. Tha'll get more out o' this than tha' will out o' silk velvet coats. After that there was no wondering what to say.
<p/>By the time the lamb fell asleep questions poured forth and Dickon answered them all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) told them how he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had found the lamb just as the sun was rising three mornings ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been standing on the moor listening to a skylark and watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) swing higher and higher into the sky until he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was only a speck in the heights of blue.
<p/>I'd almost lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) song an' I was wonderin' how a chap could hear it when it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'d get out o' th' world in a minute--
<p/>'' an' just then I heard somethin' else far off among th' gorse bushes. It was a weak bleatin' an' I knowed it was a new lamb as was hungry an'
<p/>I knowed it wouldn't be hungry if it hadn't lost its mother somehow, so I set off searchin'. Eh! I did have a look for it.
<p/>I went in an' out among th' gorse bushes an' round an' round an' I always seemed to take th' wrong turnin'.
<p/>But at last I seed a bit o' white by a rock on top o' th' moor an' I climbed up an' found th' little `un half dead wi' cold an' clemmin'.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) talked, Soot flew solemnly in and out of the open window and cawed remarks about the scenery while Nut and Shell made excursions into the big trees outside and ran up and down trunks and explored branches.
<p/>They looked at the pictures in the gardening books and Dickon knew all the flowers by their country names and knew exactly which ones were already growing in the secret garden.
<p/>I couldna' say that there name,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, pointing to one under which was written <div class="bookquote">``Aquilegia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``but us calls that a columbine, an' that there one it's a snapdragon and they both grow wild in hedges, but these is garden ones an' they're bigger an' grander.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Captain curled up near Dickon, who sat on the hearth-rug from preference. '' There's some big clumps o' columbine in th' garden.
<p/>They'll look like a bed o' blue an' white butterflies flutterin' when they're out. '' '' I'm going to see them,'' cried Colin.
<p/>'' I am going to see them!'' <div class="bookquote">``Aye, that tha' mun,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary quite seriously. '' An' tha' munnot lose no time about it.
<p/>'' CHAPTER XX <div class="bookquote">``I SHALL LIVE FOREVER--AND EVER--AND EVER! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>But they were obliged to wait more than a week because first there came some very windy days
<p/>and then Colin was threatened with a cold, which two things happening one after the other would no doubt have thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) into a rage but
<p/>that there was so much careful and mysterious planning to do and almost every day Dickon came in, if only for a few minutes, to talk about what was happening on the moor and in the lanes and hedges and on the borders of streams.
<p/>The things he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had to tell about otters' and badgers' and water-rats' houses, not to mention birds' nests and field-mice and their burrows, were enough to make you almost tremble with excitement when you heard all the intimate details from an animal charmer and realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety the whole busy underworld was working.
<p/>'' They're same as us,'' said Dickon, <div class="bookquote">``only they have to build their homes every year. An' it keeps 'em so busy they fair scuffle to get 'em done.
<p/>The most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations to be made before Colin could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the garden.
<p/>No one must see the chair-carriage and Dickon and Mary after they turned a certain corner of the shrubbery and entered upon the walk outside the ivied walls.
<p/>As each day passed, Colin had become more and more fixed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feeling that the mystery surrounding the garden was one of its greatest charms.
<p/>People must think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was simply going out with Mary and Dickon because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) liked them and did not object to their looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>Nothing must spoil that. No one must ever suspect that they had a secret. They had long and quite delightful talks about their route.
<p/>They would go up this path and down that one and cross the other and go round among the fountain flower-beds as if they were looking at the <div class="bookquote">``bedding-out plants''  (<font color='red'><b>the head gardener Roach</b></font>)</div>the head gardener, Mr. Roach, had been having arranged.
<p/>That would seem such a rational thing to do that no one would think it at all mysterious. They would turn into the shrubbery walks and lose themselves until they came to the long walls.
<p/>It was almost as serious and elaborately thought out as the plans of march made by great generals in time of war.
<p/>Rumors of the new and curious things which were occurring in the invalid's apartments had of course filtered through the servants' hall into the stable yards and out among the gardeners, but notwithstanding this, Mr. Roach was startled one day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) received orders from Master Colin's room to the effect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) must report himself in the apartment no outsider had ever seen, as the invalid himself desired to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>).
<p/>'' Well, well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) said to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) hurriedly changed his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) coat, <div class="bookquote">``what's to do now? His (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) Royal Highness that wasn't to be looked at calling up a man he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>)'s never set eyes on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) had never caught even a glimpse of the boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) uncanny looks and ways and his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) insane tempers.
<p/>The thing he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) had heard oftenest was that he (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) might die at any moment and there had been numerous fanciful descriptions of a humped back and helpless limbs, given by people who had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>).
<p/>Things are changing in this house, Mr. Roach,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Medlock, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) up the back staircase to the corridor on to which opened the hitherto mysterious chamber.
<p/>'' Mr. Roach was not without curiosity. '' '' Let's hope they're changing for the better, Mrs. Medlock,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) answered. ''
<p/>They couldn't well change for the worse,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``and queer as it all is there's them as finds their duties made a lot easier to stand up under.
<p/>Don't you be surprised, Mr. Roach, if you find yourself in the middle of a menagerie and Martha Sowerby's Dickon more at home than you or me could ever be.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There really was a sort of Magic about Dickon, as Mary always privately believed. When Mr. Roach heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) name he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) smiled quite leniently.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>)'d be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the bottom of a coal mine,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) said. '' And yet it's not impudence, either.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>)'s just fine, is that lad. '' It was perhaps well he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) had been prepared or he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) might have been startled.
<p/>When the bedroom door was opened a large crow, which seemed quite at home perched on the high back of a carven chair, announced the entrance of a visitor by saying <div class="bookquote">``Caw--Caw''  (<font color='red'><b>a visitor</b></font>)</div>quite loudly.
<p/>In spite of Mrs. Medlock's warning, Mr. Roach only just escaped being sufficiently undignified to jump backward. The young Rajah was neither in bed nor on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) sofa.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) was sitting in an armchair and a young lamb was standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) shaking its tail in feeding-lamb fashion as Dickon knelt giving it milk from its bottle.
<p/>A squirrel was perched on Dickon's bent back attentively nibbling a nut. The little girl from India was sitting on a big footstool looking on.
<p/>'' Here is Mr. Roach, Master Colin,'' said Mrs. Medlock. The young Rajah turned and looked his (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) servitor over--at least that was what the head gardener felt happened.
<p/>'' Oh, you are Roach, are you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) said. '' I sent for you to give you some very important orders.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Roach/Roach</b></font>)</div>answered Roach, wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) was to receive instructions to fell all the oaks in the park or to transform the orchards into water-gardens.
<p/>'' I am going out in my chair this afternoon,'' said Colin. '' If the fresh air agrees with me I may go out every day.
<p/>When I go, none of the gardeners are to be anywhere near the Long Walk by the garden walls. No one is to be there.
<p/>I shall go out about two o'clock and everyone must keep away until I send word that they may go back to their work.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Roach/Roach</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Roach, much relieved to hear that the oaks might remain and that the orchards were safe.
<p/>Mary,'' said Colin, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what is that thing you say in India when you have finished talking and want people to go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' You say, `You have my permission to go,''' answered Mary. The Rajah waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) hand. '' You have my permission to go, Roach,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' But, remember, this is very important.'' <div class="bookquote">``Caw--Caw! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remarked the crow hoarsely but not impolitely. '' Very good, sir. Thank you, sir,'' said Mr. Roach, and Mrs. Medlock took him (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) out of the room.
<p/>Outside in the corridor, being a rather good-natured man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost laughed. '' My word!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got a fine lordly way with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
<p/>Eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>protested Mrs. Medlock, <div class="bookquote">``we've had to let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trample all over every one of us ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had feet
<p/>You'd think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a whole Royal Family rolled into one--Prince Consort and all. '' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>. '' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) thinks that's what folks was born for.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>)'ll grow out of it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) lives,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Roach/Roach</b></font>)</div>suggested Mr. Roach. '' Well, there's one thing pretty sure,'' said Mrs. Medlock.
<p/>'' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) does live and that Indian child stays here I'll warrant she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) teaches him (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) that the whole orange does not belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>), as Susan Sowerby says.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>)'ll be likely to find out the size of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roach</b></font>) own quarter. '' Inside the room Colin was leaning back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cushions.
<p/>'' It's all safe now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' And this afternoon I shall see it--this afternoon I shall be in it!''
<p/>Dickon went back to the garden with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) creatures and Mary stayed with Colin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked tired
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was very quiet before their lunch came and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was quiet while they were eating it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered why and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) about it.
<p/>'' What big eyes you've got, Colin,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' When you are thinking they get as big as saucers. What are you thinking about now?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help thinking about what it will look like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered. '' The garden?'' asked Mary. '' The springtime,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I was thinking that I've really never seen it before. I scarcely ever went out and when I did go I never looked at it.
<p/>Shut in and morbid as his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) life had been, Colin had more imagination than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had and at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had spent a good deal of time looking at wonderful books and pictures.
<p/>I didn't even think about it.'' <div class="bookquote">``I never saw it in India because there wasn't any,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' That morning when you ran in and said `It's come!
<p/>It's come!', you made me feel quite queer. It sounded as if things were coming with a great procession and big bursts and wafts of music.
<p/>I've a picture like it in one of my books--crowds of lovely people and children with garlands and branches with blossoms on them, everyone laughing and dancing and crowding and playing on pipes.
<p/>That was why I said, `Perhaps we shall hear golden trumpets' and told you to throw open the window.'' <div class="bookquote">``How funny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/>And if all the flowers and leaves and green things and birds and wild creatures danced past at once, what a crowd it would be!
<p/>'' That's really just what it feels like. I'm sure they'd dance and sing and flute and that would be the wafts of music.
<p/>'' They both laughed but it was not because the idea was laughable but because they both so liked it. A little later the nurse made Colin ready.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) noticed that instead of lying like a log while his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) clothes were put on he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sat up and made some efforts to help himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) talked and laughed with Mary all the time.
<p/>'' This is one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) good days, sir,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to Dr. Craven, who dropped in to inspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>). ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s in such good spirits that it makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) stronger.'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll call in again later in the afternoon, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) has come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Craven.
<p/>'' I must see how the going out agrees with him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>). I wish,'' in a very low voice, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) would let you go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather give up the case this moment, sir, than even stay here while it's suggested,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>answered the nurse. With sudden firmness.
<p/>'' I hadn't really decided to suggest it,'' said the doctor, with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) slight nervousness. '' We'll try the experiment. Dickon's a lad
<p/>The strongest footman in the house carried Colin down stairs and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wheeled chair near which Dickon waited outside.
<p/>I'd trust with a new-born child. '' After the manservant had arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) rugs and cushions the Rajah waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and to the nurse.
<p/>You have my permission to go,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, and they both disappeared quickly and it must be confessed giggled when they were safely inside the house.
<p/>'' Dickon began to push the wheeled chair slowly and steadily. Mistress Mary walked beside it and Colin leaned back and lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face to the sky.
<p/>The arch of it looked very high and the small snowy clouds seemed like white birds floating on outspread wings below its crystal blueness.
<p/>Colin kept lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thin chest to draw it in, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) big eyes looked as if it were they which were listening--listening, instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) ears.
<p/>The wind swept in soft big breaths down from the moor and was strange with a wild clear scented sweetness. ''
<p/>There are so many sounds of singing and humming and calling out,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' What is that scent the puffs of wind bring?''
<p/>'' It's gorse on th' moor that's openin' out,'' answered Dickon. '' Eh! th' bees are at it wonderful today. ''
<p/>Not a human creature was to be caught sight of in the paths they took. In fact every gardener or gardener's lad had been witched away.
<p/>But they wound in and out among the shrubbery and out and round the fountain beds, following their carefully planned route for the mere mysterious pleasure of it.
<p/>But when at last they turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls the excited sense of an approaching thrill made them, for some curious reason they could not have explained, begin to speak in whispers.
<p/>'' This is it,'' breathed Mary. '' This is where I used to walk up and down and wonder and wonder.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin eyes</b></font>)</div>cried Colin, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes began to search the ivy with eager curiousness. '' But I can see nothing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) whispered.
<p/>'' There is no door.'' '' That's what I thought,'' said Mary. Then there was a lovely breathless silence and the chair wheeled on.
<p/>'' That is the garden where Ben Weatherstaff works,'' said Mary. <div class="bookquote">``Is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin. A few yards more and Mary whispered again.
<p/>'' This is where the robin flew over the wall,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Is it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div>cried Colin. '' Oh! I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'d come again!''
<p/>And that,'' said Mary with solemn delight, pointing under a big lilac bush, <div class="bookquote">``is where he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) perched on the little heap of earth and showed me the key.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes were as big as the wolf's in Red Riding-Hood, when Red Riding-Hood felt called upon to remark on them.
<p/>And this,'' said Mary, stepping on to the bed close to the ivy, <div class="bookquote">``is where I went to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chirped at me from the top of the wall.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>'' Then Colin sat up. '' Where? Where? There? Dickon stood still and the wheeled chair stopped. '' And this is the ivy the wind blew back,'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took hold of the hanging green curtain.
<p/>'' Oh! is it--is it! '' gasped Colin. '' And here is the handle, and here is the door. Dickon push him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) in--push him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) in quickly!''
<p/>But Colin had actually dropped back against his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cushions, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) gasped with delight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hands and held them there shutting out everything until they were inside and the chair stopped as if by magic and the door was closed.
<p/>Not till then did he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) take them away and look round and round and round as Dickon and Mary had done.
<p/>And over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays and tendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had crept, and in the grass under the trees and the gray urns in the alcoves and here
<p/>and there everywhere were touches or splashes of gold and purple and white and the trees were showing pink and snow above his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head and there were fluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents and scents.
<p/>And Dickon did it with one strong, steady, splendid push. And the sun fell warm upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face like a hand with a lovely touch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked so strange and different because a pink glow of color had actually crept all over him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)--ivory face and neck and hands and all.
<p/>And in wonder Mary and Dickon stood and stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). '' I shall get well! I shall get well! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried out.
<p/>CHAPTER XXI BEN WEATHERSTAFF One of the strange things about living in the world is that it is only now and then one is quite sure one is going to live forever and ever and ever.
<p/>One knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn dawn-time and goes out and stands alone and throws one's head far back and looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing and flushing and marvelous unknown things happening until the East almost makes one cry out and one's heart stands still at the strange unchanging majesty of the rising of the sun--which has been happening every morning for thousands and thousands and thousands of years.
<p/>'' Mary! Dickon! I shall get well! And I shall live forever and ever and ever!'' One knows it then for a moment or so.
<p/>And one knows it sometimes when one stands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold stillness slanting through and under the branches seems to be saying slowly again and again something one cannot quite hear, however much one tries.
<p/>Then sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night with millions of stars waiting and watching makes one sure; and sometimes a sound of far-off music makes it true; and sometimes a look in some one's eyes.
<p/>And it was like that with Colin when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) first saw and heard and felt the Springtime inside the four high walls of a hidden garden.
<p/>That afternoon the whole world seemed to devote itself to being perfect and radiantly beautiful and kind to one boy. Perhaps out of pure heavenly goodness the spring came and crowned everything it possibly could into that one place.
<p/>More than once Dickon paused in what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was doing and stood still with a sort of growing wonder in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head softly.
<p/>I'm twelve goin' on thirteen an' there's a lot o' afternoons in thirteen years, but seems to me like I never seed one as graidely as this `ere.''
<p/>'' Eh! it is graidely,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. '' <div class="bookquote">``Aye, it is a graidely one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sighed for mere joy.
<p/>'' I'll warrant it's the graidelest one as ever was in this world.'' <div class="bookquote">``Does tha' think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin with dreamy carefulness, <div class="bookquote">``as happen it was made loike this
<p/>`ere all o' purpose for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My word!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>cried Mary admiringly, <div class="bookquote">``that there is a bit o' good Yorkshire. Tha`rt shapin' first-rate--that tha' art.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>And delight reigned. They drew the chair under the plum-tree, which was snow-white with blossoms and musical with bees. It was like a king's canopy, a fairy king's.
<p/>There were flowering cherry-trees near and apple-trees whose buds were pink and white, and here and there one had burst open wide.
<p/>Between the blossoming branches of the canopy bits of blue sky looked down like wonderful eyes. Mary and Dickon worked a little here
<p/>They brought him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) things to look at--buds which were opening, buds which were tight closed, bits of twig whose leaves were just showing green, the feather of a woodpecker which had dropped on the grass, the empty shell of some bird early hatched.
<p/>Dickon pushed the chair slowly round and round the garden, stopping every other moment to let him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) look at wonders springing out of the earth or trailing down from trees.
<p/>It was like being taken in state round the country of a magic king and queen and shown all the mysterious riches it contained.
<p/>and there and Colin watched them. '' I wonder if we shall see the robin?'' said Colin. <div class="bookquote">``Tha'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) often enow after a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>answered Dickon.
<p/>'' When th' eggs hatches out th' little chap he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'ll be kep' so busy it'll make his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) head swim. Tha'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) flyin
<p/>' backward an' for`ard carryin' worms nigh as big as himsel' an' that much noise goin' on in th' nest when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) gets there as fair flusters him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) so as he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) scarce knows which big mouth to drop th' first piece in.
<p/>Mother says as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) sees th' work a robin has to keep them gapin' beaks filled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) feels like she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) was a lady with nothin' to do.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s seen th' little chaps when it seemed like th' sweat must be droppin' off 'em, though folk can't see it.
<p/>This made them giggle so delightedly that they were obliged to cover their mouths with their hands, remembering that they must not be heard.
<p/>An' gapin' beaks an' squawks on every side. '' Colin had been instructed as to the law of whispers and low voices several days before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) liked the mysteriousness of it and did his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) best, but in the midst of excited enjoyment it is rather difficult never to laugh above a whisper.
<p/>The wheeled chair had been drawn back under the canopy and Dickon had sat down on the grass and had just drawn out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pipe when Colin saw something he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had not had time to notice before.
<p/>Every moment of the afternoon was full of new things and every hour the sunshine grew more golden. '' That's a very old tree over there, isn't it?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. Dickon looked across the grass at the tree and Mary looked and there was a brief moment of stillness.
<p/>'' Yes,'' answered Dickon, after it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) low voice had a very gentle sound. Mary gazed at the tree and thought.
<p/>'' The branches are quite gray and there's not a single leaf anywhere,'' Colin went on. '' It's quite dead, isn't it?''
<p/>But them roses as has climbed all over it will near hide every bit o' th' dead wood when they're full o' leaves an' flowers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>admitted Dickon. '' It won't look dead then. It'll be th' prettiest of all. '' Mary still gazed at the tree and thought.
<p/>'' It looks as if a big branch had been broken off,'' said Colin. '' I wonder how it was done.
<p/>'' '' It's been done many a year,'' answered Dickon. <div class="bookquote">``Eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>with a sudden relieved start and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand on Colin.
<p/>Colin was almost too late but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) just caught sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), the flash of red-breasted bird with something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) beak.
<p/>'' Look at that robin! There he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) is! He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s been foragin' for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mate. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) darted through the greenness and into the close-grown corner and was out of sight.
<p/>Colin leaned back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cushion again, laughing a little. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tea to her (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). Perhaps it's five o'clock.
<p/>I think I'd like some tea myself. '' And so they were safe. '' It was Magic which sent the robin,'' said Mary secretly to Dickon afterward.
<p/>For both she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and Dickon had been afraid Colin might ask something about the tree whose branch had broken off ten years ago and they had talked it over together
<p/>'' I know it was Magic. '' and Dickon had stood and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head in a troubled way. '' We mun look as if it wasn't no different from th' other trees,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had said.
<p/>'' We couldn't never tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) how it broke, poor lad. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) says anything about it we mun--we mun try to look cheerful.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that we mun,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>had answered Mary. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked cheerful when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gazed at the tree.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had gone on rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) rust-red hair in a puzzled way, but a nice comforted look had begun to grow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) blue eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was any reality in that other thing Dickon had said. ''
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thinks maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'s about Misselthwaite many a time lookin' after Mester Colin, same as all mothers do when they're took out o' th' world.
<p/>Mrs. Craven was a very lovely young lady,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had gone on rather hesitatingly. '' An' mother They have to come back, tha' sees.
<p/>Happen she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s been in the garden an' happen it was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) set us to work, an' told us to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) here.
<p/>'' Mary had thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) meant something about Magic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a great believer in Magic. Secretly she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) quite believed that Dickon worked Magic, of course good Magic, on everything near him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered, indeed, if it were not possible that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) gift had brought the robin just at the right moment when Colin asked that dangerous question.
<p/>and that was why people liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) so much and wild creatures knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was their friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) Magic was working all the afternoon and making Colin look like an entirely different boy.
<p/>It did not seem possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could be the crazy creature who had screamed and beaten and bitten his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pillow.
<p/>The faint glow of color which had shown on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face and neck and hands when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) first got inside the garden really never quite died away.
<p/>Even his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) ivory whiteness seemed to change. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were made of flesh instead of ivory or wax.
<p/>They saw the robin carry food to his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mate two or three times, and it was so suggestive of afternoon tea that Colin felt they must have some.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and make one of the men servants bring some in a basket to the rhododendron walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' And then you and Dickon can bring it here.
<p/>It was an agreeable idea, easily carried out, and when the white cloth was spread upon the grass, with hot tea and buttered toast and crumpets, a delightfully hungry meal was eaten, and several birds on domestic errands paused to inquire what was going on and were led into investigating crumbs with great activity.
<p/>Nut and Shell whisked up trees with pieces of cake and Soot took the entire half of a buttered crumpet into a corner and pecked at and examined and turned it over and made hoarse remarks about it until he (<font color='blue'><b>Shell</b></font>) decided to swallow it all joyfully in one gulp.
<p/>The sun was deepening the gold of its lances, the bees were going home and the birds were flying past less often.
<p/>Dickon and Mary were sitting on the grass, the tea-basket was repacked ready to be taken back to the house, and Colin was lying against his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cushions with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) heavy locks pushed back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) forehead and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face looking quite a natural color.
<p/>'' The afternoon was dragging towards its mellow hour. '' I don't want this afternoon to go,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but I shall come back tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after, and the day after.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll get plenty of fresh air, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary. '' I'm going to get nothing else,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered. ''
<p/>I've seen the spring now and I'm going to see the summer. I'm going to see everything grow here. I'm going to grow here myself.''
<p/>'' That tha' will,'' said Dickon. '' Us'll have thee walkin' about here an' diggin' same as other folk afore long.
<p/>'' Colin flushed tremendously. <div class="bookquote">``Walk! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' Dig! Shall I? '' Dickon's glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was delicately cautious. Neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) nor Mary had ever asked if anything was the matter with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) legs.
<p/>'' For sure tha' will,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said stoutly. '' Tha--tha's got legs o' thine own, same as other folks! '' Mary was rather frightened until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard Colin's answer.
<p/>'' Nothing really ails them,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but they are so thin and weak. They shake so that I'm afraid to try to stand on them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Both Mary and Dickon drew a relieved breath. '' When tha' stops bein' afraid tha`lt stand on 'em,'' Dickon said with renewed cheer.
<p/>'' An' tha`lt stop bein' afraid in a bit. '' <div class="bookquote">``I shall?''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lay still as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were wondering about things.
<p/>They were really very quiet for a little while. The sun was dropping lower. It was that hour when everything stills itself, and they really had had a busy and exciting afternoon.
<p/>Colin looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were resting luxuriously. Even the creatures had ceased moving about and had drawn together and were resting near them.
<p/>Soot had perched on a low branch and drawn up one leg and dropped the gray film drowsily over his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>In the midst of this stillness it was rather startling when Colin half lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head and exclaimed in a loud suddenly alarmed whisper:
<p/>Mary privately thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) might snore in a minute. <div class="bookquote">``Who is that man? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>Dickon and Mary scrambled to their feet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Man! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>they both cried in low quick voices. Colin pointed to the high wall. <div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) whispered excitedly. '' Just look!''
<p/>Mary and Dickon wheeled about and looked. There was Ben Weatherstaff's indignant face glaring at them over the wall from the top of a ladder!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) actually shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) fist at Mary. '' If I wasn't a bachelder, an' tha' was a wench o' mine,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I'd give thee a hidin'!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) mounted another step threateningly as if it were his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) energetic intention to jump down and deal with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) evidently thought better of it and stood on the top step of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) ladder shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) fist down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>'' I never thowt much o' thee! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) harangued. '' I couldna' abide thee th' first time I set eyes on thee.
<p/>A scrawny buttermilk-faced young besom, allus askin' questions an' pokin' tha' nose where it wasna, wanted. I never knowed how tha' got so thick
<p/>wi' me. If it hadna' been for th' robin-- Drat him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Ben Weatherstaff,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>called out Mary, finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stood below him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) and called up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) with a sort of gasp.
<p/>Then it did seem as if Ben really would scramble down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) side of the wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was so outraged.
<p/>'' Ben Weatherstaff, it was the robin who showed me the way! '' '' Tha' young bad `un!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) called down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>'' Layin' tha' badness on a robin--not but what he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)'s impidint enow for anythin'. Him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) showin' thee th' way! Him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)! Eh!
<p/>tha ' young nowt''--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) next words burst out because he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was overpowered by curiosity--<div class="bookquote">``however i' this world did tha' get in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' It was the robin who showed me the way,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) protested obstinately. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) didn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was doing it
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stopped shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) fist very suddenly at that very moment and his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) jaw actually dropped as he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) stared over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head at something he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) saw coming over the grass toward him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>).
<p/>At the first sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) torrent of words Colin had been so surprised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had only sat up and listened as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were spellbound.
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did. And I can't tell you from here while you're shaking your fist at me. '' But in the midst of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously to Dickon.
<p/>'' Wheel me over there!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) commanded. '' Wheel me quite close and stop right in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)!'' And this, if you please, this is what Ben Weatherstaff beheld and which made his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) jaw drop.
<p/>A wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robes which came toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) looking rather like some sort of State Coach because a young Rajah leaned back in it with royal command in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) great black-rimmed eyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>).
<p/>And it stopped right under Ben Weatherstaff's nose. It was really no wonder his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) mouth dropped open. '' Do you know who I am?'' demanded the Rajah.
<p/>How Ben Weatherstaff stared! His (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) red old eyes fixed themselves on what was before him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) were seeing a ghost.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) gazed and gazed and gulped a lump down his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) throat and did not say a word. '' Do you know who I am?
<p/>'' demanded Colin still more imperiously. <div class="bookquote">``Answer!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>Ben Weatherstaff put his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) gnarled hand up and passed it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) eyes and over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) forehead
<p/>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did answer in a queer shaky voice. '' Who tha' art? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said. '' Aye, that I do--wi' tha' mother's eyes starin' at me out o' tha' face.
<p/>Lord knows how tha' come here. But tha`rt th' poor cripple. '' Colin forgot that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had ever had a back.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face flushed scarlet and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sat bolt upright. '' I'm not a cripple! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried out furiously. '' I'm not!''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s not! '' cried Mary, almost shouting up the wall in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fierce indignation. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s not got a lump as big as a pin!
<p/>I looked and there was none there--not one!'' Ben Weatherstaff passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) forehead again and gazed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) could never gaze enough.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was an ignorant old man and a tactless old man and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) could only remember the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had heard.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) hand shook and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) mouth shook and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) voice shook. '' Tha'--tha' hasn't got a crooked back? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said hoarsely.
<p/>'' No!'' shouted Colin. '' Tha'--tha' hasn't got crooked legs?'' quavered Ben more hoarsely yet. It was too much. The strength which Colin usually threw into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tantrums rushed through him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) now in a new way.
<p/>Never yet had he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) been accused of crooked legs--even in whispers--and the perfectly simple belief in their existence which was revealed by Ben Weatherstaff's voice was more than Rajah flesh and blood could endure.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) anger and insulted pride made him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) forget everything but this one moment and filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) with a power he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had never known before, an almost unnatural strength.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) shouted to Dickon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) actually began to tear the coverings off his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) lower limbs and disentangle himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here! Come here! This minute! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>Dickon was by his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) side in a second. Mary caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath in a short gasp and felt herself turn pale.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) can do it! He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) can do it! He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) can do it! He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) can! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gabbled over to herself under her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath as fast as ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could.
<p/>There was a brief fierce scramble, the rugs were tossed on the ground, Dickon held Colin's arm, the thin legs were out, the thin feet were on the grass.
<p/>Colin was standing upright--upright--as straight as an arrow and looking strangely tall--his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head thrown back and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strange eyes flashing lightning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at me! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) flung up at Ben Weatherstaff. '' Just look at me--you! Just look at me!'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s as straight as I am!'' cried Dickon.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>)'s as straight as any lad i' Yorkshire!'' What Ben Weatherstaff did Mary thought queer beyond measure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) choked and gulped and suddenly tears ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) weather-wrinkled cheeks as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) old hands together.
<p/>'' Eh! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) burst forth, <div class="bookquote">``th' lies folk tells! Tha`rt as thin as a lath an' as white as a wraith, but there's not a knob on thee.
<p/>Tha`lt make a mon yet. God bless thee!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Dickon held Colin's arm strongly but the boy had not begun to falter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood straighter and straighter and looked Ben Weatherstaff in the face. '' I'm your master,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``when my father is away.
<p/>You get down from that ladder and go out to the Long Walk and Miss Mary will meet you and bring you here.
<p/>And you are to obey me. This is my garden. Don't dare to say a word about it! I want to talk to you.
<p/>We did not want you, but now you will have to be in the secret. Be quick!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ben Weatherstaff's crabbed old face was still wet with that one queer rush of tears.
<p/>It seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) could not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) eyes from thin straight Colin standing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feet with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head thrown back.
<p/>'' Eh! lad,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) almost whispered. '' Eh! my lad!'' And then remembering himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) suddenly touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hat gardener fashion and said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir!
<p/>Yes, sir! ''  (<font color='red'><b>gardener</b></font>)</div>and obediently disappeared as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) descended the ladder. CHAPTER XXII WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN When his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head was out of sight Colin turned to Mary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said; and Mary flew across the grass to the door under the ivy. Dickon was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with sharp eyes.
<p/>There were scarlet spots on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cheeks and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked amazing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) showed no signs of falling. '' I can stand,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head was still held up and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said it quite grandly.
<p/>'' I told thee tha' could as soon as tha' stopped bein' afraid,'' answered Dickon. '' An' tha's stopped. '' ''
<p/>Yes, I've stopped,'' said Colin. Then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) remembered something Mary had said. '' Are you making Magic? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) asked sharply.
<p/>It's same Magic as made these `ere work out o' th' earth,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) touched with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thick boot a clump of crocuses in the grass.
<p/>Dickon's curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin. '' Tha's doin' Magic thysel','' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' Colin looked down at them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said slowly, <div class="bookquote">``there couldna' be bigger Magic than that there--there couldna' be. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) drew himself up straighter than ever.
<p/>'' I'm going to walk to that tree,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, pointing to one a few feet away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). '' I'm going to be standing when Weatherstaff comes here.
<p/>I can rest against the tree if I like. When I want to sit down I will sit down, but not before.
<p/>Bring a rug from the chair. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) walked to the tree and though Dickon held his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was wonderfully steady.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) supported himself against it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) still held himself so straight that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) looked tall.
<p/>When Ben Weatherstaff came through the door in the wall he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) standing there and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) heard Mary muttering something under her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) breath.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) asked rather testily because he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did not want his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) attention distracted from the long thin straight boy figure and proud face.
<p/>'' What art sayin'? '' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>). What she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was saying was this: <div class="bookquote">``You can do it!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was saying it to Colin because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to make Magic and keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feet looking like that.
<p/>You can do it! I told you you could! You can do it! You can do it! You can! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not bear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) should give in before Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did not give in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was uplifted by a sudden feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) looked quite beautiful in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) thinness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) eyes on Ben Weatherstaff in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) funny imperious way. '' Look at me!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) commanded. '' Look at me all over!
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff had not quite got over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) emotion, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had recovered a little and answered almost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) usual way.
<p/>Am I a hunchback? Have I got crooked legs?'' '' Not tha','' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said. '' Nowt o' th' sort. What's tha' been doin' with thysel'--hidin' out o' sight
<p/>an' lettin' folk think tha' was cripple an' half-witted? '' <div class="bookquote">``Half-witted!''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin angrily. '' Who thought that?'' <div class="bookquote">``Lots o' fools,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben.
<p/>'' Th' world's full o ' jackasses brayin' an' they never bray nowt but lies. What did tha' shut thysel' up for?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everyone thought I was going to die,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div>said Colin shortly. '' I'm not!'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said it with such decision Ben Weatherstaff looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) over, up and down, down and up.
<p/>'' Tha' die! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said with dry exultation. '' Nowt o' th' sort! Tha's got too much pluck in thee.
<p/>When I seed thee put tha' legs on th' ground in such a hurry I knowed tha' was all right. Sit thee down on th' rug
<p/>a bit young Mester an' give me thy orders. '' There was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd understanding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mester</b></font>) manner.
<p/>Mary had poured out speech as rapidly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could as they had come down the Long Walk. The chief thing to be remembered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mester</b></font>), was that Colin was getting well--getting well.
<p/>The garden was doing it. No one must let him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) remember about having humps and dying. The Rajah condescended to seat himself on a rug under the tree.
<p/>'' What work do you do in the gardens, Weatherstaff? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) inquired. '' Anythin' I'm told to do,'' answered old Ben.
<p/>'' I'm kep' on by favor--because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked me.'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin. '' Tha' mother,'' answered Ben Weatherstaff. '' My mother?'' said Colin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) quietly.
<p/>'' This was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) garden, wasn't it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Aye, it was that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>and Ben Weatherstaff looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) too. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were main fond of it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my garden now. I am fond of it. I shall come here every day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div>announced Colin. '' But it is to be a secret.
<p/>My orders are that no one is to know that we come here. Dickon and my cousin have worked and made it come alive.
<p/>I shall send for you sometimes to help--but you must come when no one can see you. '' Ben Weatherstaff's face twisted itself in a dry old smile.
<p/>'' I've come here before when no one saw me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Colin. <div class="bookquote">``When?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Th' last time I was here,'' rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chin and looking round, <div class="bookquote">``was about two year' ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But no one has been in it for ten years!'' cried Colin. '' There was no door!'' '' I'm no one,'' said old Ben dryly.
<p/>'' An' I didn't come through th' door. I come over th' wall. Th' rheumatics held me back th' last two year'.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Tha' come an' did a bit o' prunin'! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>cried Dickon. '' I couldn't make out how it had been done.''
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was so fond of it--she (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was!'' said Ben Weatherstaff slowly. '' An' she (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was such a pretty young thing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) says to me once, `Ben,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) laughin', `if ever I'm ill or if I go away you must take care of my roses.'
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did go away th' orders was no one was ever to come nigh. But I come,'' with grumpy obstinacy.
<p/>'' Over th' wall I come--until th' rheumatics stopped me-- an' I did a bit o' work once a year. She (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'d gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) order first.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't have been as wick as it is if tha' hadn't done it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon. '' I did wonder.
<p/>'' '' I'm glad you did it, Weatherstaff,'' said Colin. '' You'll know how to keep the secret.'' <div class="bookquote">``Aye, I'll know, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>answered Ben.
<p/>'' An' it'll be easier for a man wi' rheumatics to come in at th' door. '' On the grass near the tree Mary had dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) trowel.
<p/>Colin stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand and took it up. An odd expression came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to scratch at the earth.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thin hand was weak enough but presently as they watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)-- Mary with quite breathless interest--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) drove the end of the trowel into the soil and turned some over.
<p/>'' You can do it! You can do it!'' said Mary to herself. '' I tell you, you can!'' Dickon's round eyes were full of eager curiousness but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said not a word.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff looked on with interested face. Colin persevered. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spoke exultantly to Dickon in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) best Yorkshire.
<p/>'' Tha' said as tha'd have me walkin' about here same as other folk--an' tha' said tha'd have me diggin'. I thowt tha' was just leein' to please me.
<p/>This is only th' first day an' I've walked--an' here I am diggin'. '' Ben Weatherstaff's mouth fell open again when he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) ended by chuckling.
<p/>'' Eh!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that sounds as if tha'd got wits enow. Tha`rt a Yorkshire lad for sure. An' tha`rt diggin', too.
<p/>How'd tha' like to plant a bit o' somethin'? I can get thee a rose in a pot.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go and get it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin, digging excitedly.
<p/>Dickon took his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spade and dug the hole deeper and wider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it.
<p/>'' Quick! Quick! '' It was done quickly enough indeed. Ben Weatherstaff went his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) way forgetting rheumatics. Mary slipped out to run and bring back a watering-can.
<p/>When Dickon had deepened the hole Colin went on turning the soft earth over and over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked up at the sky, flushed and glowing with the strangely new exercise, slight as it was.
<p/>'' I want to do it before the sun goes quite--quite down,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. Mary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just on purpose.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff brought the rose in its pot from the greenhouse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) hobbled over the grass as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) could.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had begun to be excited, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) knelt down by the hole and broke the pot from the mould. ''
<p/>Here, lad,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said, handing the plant to Colin. '' Set it in the earth thysel' same as th' king does when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) goes to a new place.
<p/>The thin white hands shook a little and Colin's flush grew deeper as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) set the rose in the mould and held it while old Ben made firm the earth.
<p/>'' It was filled in and pressed down and made steady. Mary was leaning forward on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands and knees. Soot had flown down and marched forward to see what was being done.
<p/>Nut and Shell chattered about it from a cherry-tree. '' It's planted!'' said Colin at last. '' And the sun is only slipping over the edge.
<p/>And Dickon helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), and the Magic--or whatever it was--so gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strength that when the sun did slip over the edge and end the strange lovely afternoon for them there he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) actually stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) two feet--laughing.
<p/>Help me up, Dickon. I want to be standing when it goes. That's part of the Magic. '' CHAPTER XXIII MAGIC Dr. Craven had been waiting some time at the house when they returned to it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had indeed begun to wonder if it might not be wise to send some one out to explore the garden paths.
<p/>When Colin was brought back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room the poor man looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) over seriously. '' You should not have stayed so long,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' You must not overexert yourself.'' <div class="bookquote">``I am not tired at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin. '' It has made me well. Tomorrow I am going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that I can allow it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>answered Dr. Craven. '' I am afraid it would not be wise.''
<p/>Even Mary had found out that one of Colin's chief peculiarities was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not know in the least what a rude little brute he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) way of ordering people about.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had lived on a sort of desert island all his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) life and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been the king of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) own manners and had had no one to compare himself with.
<p/>Mary had indeed been rather like him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) herself and since she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been at Misselthwaite had gradually discovered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own manners had not been of the kind which is usual or popular.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would not be wise to try to stop me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin quite seriously. '' I am going. '' Having made this discovery she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) naturally thought it of enough interest to communicate to Colin.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) curiously for a few minutes after Dr. Craven had gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was doing it
<p/>and of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did. '' What are you looking at me for? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said. '' I'm thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr. Craven.''
<p/>'' So am I,'' said Colin calmly, but not without an air of some satisfaction. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) won't get Misselthwaite at all now I'm not going to die.
<p/>I'm sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) because of that, of course,'' said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``but I was thinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have had to be polite for ten years to a boy who was always rude.
<p/>If you had been his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own boy and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been a slapping sort of man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would have slapped you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' I would never have done it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Am I rude?''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>Colin inquired undisturbedly. '' '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) daren't,'' said Colin.
<p/>'' No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) daren't,'' answered Mistress Mary, thinking the thing out quite without prejudice. '' Nobody ever dared to do anything you didn't like--because you were going to die and things like that.
<p/>You were such a poor thing.'' '' But,'' announced Colin stubbornly, <div class="bookquote">``I am not going to be a poor thing. I won't let people think I'm one.
<p/>I stood on my feet this afternoon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is always having your own way that has made you so queer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Mary went on, thinking aloud.
<p/>Colin turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head, frowning. '' Am I queer? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) demanded. '' Yes,'' answered Mary, <div class="bookquote">``very. But you needn't be cross,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) added impartially, <div class="bookquote">``because so am
<p/>I queer--and so is Ben Weatherstaff. But I am not as queer as I was before I began to like people and
<p/>before I found the garden. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to be queer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin. '' I am not going to be,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) frowned again with determination.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was a very proud boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lay thinking for a while and then Mary saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) beautiful smile begin and gradually change his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) whole face.
<p/>'' I shall stop being queer,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if I go every day to the garden. There is Magic in there--good Magic, you know, Mary.
<p/>I am sure there is.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' So am I,'' said Mary. '' Even if it isn't real Magic,'' Colin said, <div class="bookquote">``we can pretend it is.
<p/>They always called it Magic and indeed it seemed like it in the months that followed--the wonderful months--the radiant months--the amazing ones.
<p/>Something is there--something!''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>'' It's Magic,'' said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``but not black. It's as white as snow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>Oh! the things which happened in that garden!
<p/>If you have never had a garden you cannot understand, and if you have had a garden you will know that it would take a whole book to describe all that came to pass there.
<p/>At first it seemed that green things would never cease pushing their way through the earth, in the grass, in the beds, even in the crevices of the walls.
<p/>Then the green things began to show buds and the buds began to unfurl and show color, every shade of blue, every shade of purple, every tint and hue of crimson.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff had seen it done and had himself scraped out mortar from between the bricks of the wall and made pockets of earth for lovely clinging things to grow on.
<p/>Iris and white lilies rose out of the grass in sheaves, and the green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armies of the blue and white flower lances of tall delphiniums or columbines or campanulas.
<p/>In its happy days flowers had been tucked away into every inch and hole and corner. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) was main fond o' them--she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) was,'' Ben Weatherstaff said.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) liked them things as was allus pointin' up to th' blue sky, she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) used to tell. Not as she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) was one o' them as looked down on th' earth--not her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) just loved it but she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) said as th' blue sky allus looked so joyful. '' The seeds Dickon and Mary had planted grew as if fairies had tended them.
<p/>Satiny poppies of all tints danced in the breeze by the score, gaily defying flowers which had lived in the garden for years and which it might be confessed seemed rather to wonder how such new people had got there.
<p/>Rising out of the grass, tangled round the sun-dial, wreathing the tree trunks and hanging from their branches, climbing up the walls and spreading over them with long garlands falling in cascades--they came alive day by day, hour by hour.
<p/>Fair fresh leaves, and buds--and buds--tiny at first but swelling and working Magic until they burst and uncurled into cups of scent delicately spilling themselves over their brims and filling the garden air.
<p/>Every morning he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was brought out and every hour of each day when it didn't rain he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) spent in the garden.
<p/>And the roses--the roses! Colin saw it all, watching each change as it took place. Even gray days pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would lie on the grass <div class="bookquote">``watching things growing,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>Also you could make the acquaintance of strange busy insect things running about on various unknown but evidently serious errands, sometimes carrying tiny scraps of straw or feather or food, or climbing blades of grass as if they were trees from whose tops one could look out to explore the country.
<p/>A mole throwing up its mound at the end of its burrow and making its way out at last with the long-nailed paws which looked so like elfish hands, had absorbed him (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) one whole morning.
<p/>Ants' ways, beetles' ways, bees' ways, frogs' ways, birds' ways, plants' ways, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) a new world to explore and when Dickon revealed them all and added foxes' ways, otters' ways, ferrets' ways, squirrels' ways, and trout' and water-rats' and badgers' ways, there was no end to the things to talk about and think over.
<p/>If you watched long enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) declared, you could see buds unsheath themselves. And this was not the half of the Magic.
<p/>The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) had really once stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>mole</b></font>) feet had set Colin thinking tremendously and when Mary told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) of the spell she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had worked he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was excited and approved of it greatly.
<p/>Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said wisely one day, <div class="bookquote">``but people don't know what it is like or how to make it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) talked of it constantly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen until you make them happen.
<p/>I am going to try and experiment. '' The next morning when they went to the secret garden he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sent at once for Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>Ben came as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) could and found the Rajah standing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) feet under a tree and looking very grand but also very beautifully smiling.
<p/>I want you and Dickon and Miss Mary to stand in a row and listen to me because I am going to tell you something very important.''
<p/>-LRB-One of the long concealed charms of Ben Weatherstaff was that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) boyhood he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had once run away to sea and had made voyages.
<p/>'' Good morning, Ben Weatherstaff,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said. '' <div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>answered Ben Weatherstaff, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) forehead. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) could reply like a sailor.-RRB-
<p/>When I grow up I am going to make great scientific discoveries and I am going to begin now with this experiment.''
<p/>'' I am going to try a scientific experiment,'' explained the Rajah. '' <div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben Weatherstaff promptly, though this was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had heard of great scientific discoveries.
<p/>It was the first time Mary had heard of them, either, but even at this stage she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had begun to realize that
<p/>, queer as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was, Colin had read about a great many singular things and was somehow a very convincing sort of boy.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head and fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) strange eyes on you it seemed as if you believed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) almost in spite of yourself though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was only ten years old--going on eleven.
<p/>At this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was especially convincing because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) suddenly felt the fascination of actually making a sort of speech like a grown-up person.
<p/>Magic is a great thing and scarcely any one knows anything about it except a few people in old books--and Mary a little, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was born in India where there are fakirs.
<p/>'' The great scientific discoveries I am going to make,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``will be about Magic. I believe Dickon knows some Magic, but perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) doesn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knows it.
<p/>I would never have let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) come to see me if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not been an animal charmer--which is a boy charmer, too, because a boy is an animal.
<p/>I am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have not sense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us--like electricity and horses and steam.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) charms animals and people. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This sounded so imposing that Ben Weatherstaff became quite excited and really could not keep still.
<p/>'' Aye, aye, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) began to stand up quite straight. '' When Mary found this garden it looked quite dead,'' the orator proceeded.
<p/>'' Then something began pushing things up out of the soil and making things out of nothing. One day things weren't there and another they were.
<p/>I had never watched things before and it made me feel very curious. Scientific people are always curious and I am going to be scientific.
<p/>I keep saying to myself, `What is it? What is it?' It's something. It can't be nothing! I don't know its name
<p/>I have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have and from what they tell me I am sure that is Magic too.
<p/>Sometimes since I've been in the garden I've looked up through the trees at the sky and I have had a strange feeling of being happy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making me breathe fast.
<p/>so I call it Magic. Something pushes it up and draws it. Magic is always pushing and drawing and making things out of nothing.
<p/>Everything is made out of Magic, leaves and trees, flowers and birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and people. So it must be all around us.
<p/>The Magic in this garden has made me stand up and know I am going to live to be a man.
<p/>I am going to make the scientific experiment of trying to get some and put it in myself and make it push and draw me and make me strong.
<p/>In this garden--in all the places. I don't know how to do it but I think that if you keep thinking about it and calling it perhaps it will come.
<p/>When I was going to try to stand that first time Mary kept saying to herself as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could, `You can do it!
<p/>Perhaps that is the first baby way to get it. You can do it!' and I did. I had to try myself at the same time, of course, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) Magic helped me--and so did Dickon's.
<p/>Every morning and evening and as often in the daytime as I can remember I am going to say, `Magic is in me!
<p/>Magic is making me well! I am going to be as strong as Dickon, as strong as Dickon!' And you must all do it, too.
<p/>If you keep doing it every day as regularly as soldiers go through drill we shall see what will happen and find out if the experiment succeeds.
<p/>That is my experiment Will you help, Ben Weatherstaff?'' <div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben Weatherstaff. '' Aye, aye!'' '' You learn things by saying them over and over and thinking about them until they stay in your mind forever
<p/>and I think it will be the same with Magic. If you keep calling it to come to you and help you it will get to be part of you
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I once heard an officer in India tell my mother that there were fakirs who said words over and over thousands of times,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
<p/>I've heard Jem Fettleworth's wife say th' same thing over thousands o' times--callin' Jem a drunken brute,'' said Ben Weatherstaff dryly.
<p/>and it will stay and do things. '' '' '' Summat allus come o' that, sure enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a good hidin' an' went to th' Blue Lion an' got as drunk as a lord.
<p/>'' Colin drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) brows together and thought a few minutes. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cheered up. '' Well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you see something did come of it.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'d used the right Magic and had said something nice perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wouldn't have got as drunk as a lord and perhaps--perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) might have bought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a new bonnet.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) used the wrong Magic until she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ben Weatherstaff chuckled and there was shrewd admiration in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) little old eyes.
<p/>Next time I see Bess Fettleworth I'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a bit of a hint o' what Magic will do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tha`rt a clever lad as well as a straight-legged one, Mester Colin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'d be rare an' pleased if th' sinetifik `speriment worked--an' so `ud Jem.
<p/>Nut and Shell were on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) shoulders and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) held a long-eared white rabbit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) arm and stroked and stroked it softly while it laid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself.
<p/>'' Dickon had stood listening to the lecture, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) round eyes shining with curious delight. '' Do you think the experiment will work?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) so often wondered what Dickon was thinking when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) or at one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``creatures''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) happy wide smile.
<p/>'' Colin asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), wondering what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was thinking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) smiled now and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) smile was wider than usual. <div class="bookquote">``Aye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``that I do.
<p/>It'll work same as th' seeds do when th' sun shines on 'em. It'll work for sure. Shall us begin it now?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Colin was delighted and so was Mary. Fired by recollections of fakirs and devotees in illustrations Colin suggested that they should all sit cross-legged under the tree which made a canopy.
<p/>'' It will be like sitting in a sort of temple,'' said Colin. '' I'm rather tired and I want to sit down.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon, <div class="bookquote">``tha' mustn't begin by sayin' tha`rt tired. Tha' might spoil th' Magic. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>Colin turned and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)--into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) innocent round eyes.
<p/>'' That's true,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said slowly. '' I must only think of the Magic. '' It all seemed most majestic and mysterious when they sat down in their circle.
<p/>Ordinarily he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was very fixed in being what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``agen' prayer-meetin's''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but this being the Rajah's affair he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) did not resent it and was indeed inclined to be gratified at being called upon to assist.
<p/>Dickon held his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) rabbit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) arm, and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) made some charmer's signal no one heard, for when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) sat down, cross-legged like the rest, the crow, the fox, the squirrels and the lamb slowly drew near and made part of the circle, settling each into a place of rest as if of their own desire.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had somehow been led into appearing at a prayer-meeting. Mistress Mary felt solemnly enraptured. ''
<p/>The `creatures' have come,'' said Colin gravely. '' They want to help us. '' Colin really looked quite beautiful, Mary thought.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head high as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt like a sort of priest and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strange eyes had a wonderful look in them.
<p/>The light shone on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) through the tree canopy. '' Now we will begin,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' Shall we sway backward and forward, Mary, as if we were dervishes?''
<p/>The Magic will take them away,'' said Colin in a High Priest tone, ``but we won't sway until it has done it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I canna' do no swayin' back`ard and for`ard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben Weatherstaff. '' I've got th' rheumatics.'' '' We will only chant.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I canna' do no chantin'''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben Weatherstaff a trifle testily. '' They turned me out o' th' church choir th' only time I ever tried it.
<p/>'' No one smiled. They were all too much in earnest. Colin's face was not even crossed by a shadow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was thinking only of the Magic.
<p/>'' Then I will chant,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began, looking like a strange boy spirit. '' The sun is shining--the sun is shining.
<p/>That is the Magic. The flowers are growing--the roots are stirring. That is the Magic. Being alive is the Magic--being strong is the Magic.
<p/>The Magic is in me--the Magic is in me. It is in me--it is in me. It's in every one of us.
<p/>It's in Ben Weatherstaff's back. Magic! Magic! Come and help!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said it a great many times--not a thousand times but quite a goodly number.
<p/>Mary listened entranced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt as if it were at once queer and beautiful and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) to go on and on.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff began to feel soothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable. The humming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice and drowsily melted into a doze.
<p/>Soot had pushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) shoulder, the gray film dropped over his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Dickon sat cross-legged with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) rabbit asleep on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) arm and a hand resting on the lamb's back. At last Colin stopped.
<p/>'' Now I am going to walk round the garden,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) announced. Ben Weatherstaff's head had just dropped forward and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) lifted it with a jerk.
<p/>'' You have been asleep,'' said Colin. '' Nowt o' th' sort,'' mumbled Ben. '' Th' sermon was good enow--but I'm bound to get out afore th' collection.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was not quite awake yet. '' You're not in church,'' said Colin. '' Not me,'' said Ben, straightening himself.
<p/>'' Who said I were? I heard every bit of it. You said th' Magic was in my back. Th' doctor calls it rheumatics.
<p/>'' The Rajah waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) hand. '' That was the wrong Magic,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) said. '' You will get better. You have my permission to go to your work.
<p/>But come back tomorrow. '' '' I'd like to see thee walk round the garden,'' grunted Ben. It was not an unfriendly grunt, but it was a grunt.
<p/>In fact, being a stubborn old party and not having entire faith in Magic he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) mind that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) were sent away he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) would climb his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) ladder and look over the wall so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) might be ready to hobble back if there were any stumbling.
<p/>The Rajah did not object to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) staying and so the procession was formed. It really did look like a procession.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff walked behind, and the <div class="bookquote">``creatures''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>trailed after them, the lamb and the fox cub keeping close to Dickon, the white rabbit hopping along or stopping to nibble and Soot following with the solemnity of a person who felt himself in charge.
<p/>Colin was at its head with Dickon on one side and Mary on the other. It was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity.
<p/>Colin leaned on Dickon's arm and privately Ben Weatherstaff kept a sharp lookout, but now and then Colin took his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand from its support and walked a few steps alone.
<p/>Every few yards it stopped to rest. His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head was held up all the time and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked very grand. ''
<p/>The Magic is in me! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) kept saying. '' The Magic is making me strong! I can feel it! I can feel it!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sat on the seats in the alcoves, and once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sat down on the grass and several times he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) paused in the path and leaned on Dickon, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) would not give up until he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had gone all round the garden.
<p/>It seemed very certain that something was upholding and uplifting him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) returned to the canopy tree his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cheeks were flushed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) looked triumphant.
<p/>'' I did it! The Magic worked! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried. '' That is my first scientific discovery. ''. '' What will Dr. Craven say?'' broke out Mary.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) won't say anything,'' Colin answered, <div class="bookquote">``because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) will not be told. This is to be the biggest secret of all.
<p/>No one is to know anything about it until I have grown so strong that I can walk and run like any other boy.
<p/>I won't have people whispering and asking questions and I won't let my father hear about it until the experiment has quite succeeded.
<p/>I shall come here every day in my chair and I shall be taken back in it. Then sometime when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes back to Misselthwaite
<p/>I shall just walk into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) study and say `Here I am; I am like any other boy. I am quite well
<p/>and I shall live to be a man. It has been done by a scientific experiment.'''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in a dream,'' cried Mary.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made himself believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to get well, which was really more than half the battle, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been aware of it.
<p/>And the thought which stimulated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more than any other was this imagining what his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father would look like when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a son who was as straight and strong as other fathers' sons.
<p/>One of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) darkest miseries in the unhealthy morbid past days had been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hatred of being a sickly weak-backed boy whose father was afraid to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>One of the things I am going to do, after the Magic works and before I begin to make scientific discoveries, is to be an athlete.''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>athlete</b></font>) won't believe his (<font color='blue'><b>athlete</b></font>) eyes. '' Colin flushed triumphantly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'ll be obliged to believe them,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' <div class="bookquote">``We shall have thee takin' to boxin' in a week or so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>'' Tha`lt end wi ' winnin' th' Belt an' bein' champion prize-fighter of all England. '' Colin fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sternly.
<p/>'' Weatherstaff,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that is disrespectful. You must not take liberties because you are in the secret. However much the Magic works I shall not be a prize-fighter.
<p/>I shall be a Scientific Discoverer. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Ax pardon--ax pardon, sir'' answered Ben, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) forehead in salute. '' I ought to have seed
<p/>it wasn't a jokin' matter,'' but his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) eyes twinkled and secretly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was immensely pleased. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) really did not mind being snubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was gaining strength and spirit.
<p/>CHAPTER XXIV <div class="bookquote">``LET THEM LAUGH''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>The secret garden was not the only one Dickon worked in. Round the cottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wall of rough stones.
<p/>Early in the morning and late in the fading twilight and on all the days Colin and Mary did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), Dickon worked there planting or tending potatoes and cabbages, turnips and carrots and herbs for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mother.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dug or weeded he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) whistled or sang bits of Yorkshire moor songs or talked to Soot or Captain or the brothers and sisters he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had taught to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<p/>In the company of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``creatures''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did wonders there and was never tired of doing them, it seemed. '' We'd never get on as comfortable as we do,'' Mrs. Sowerby said, <div class="bookquote">``if it wasn't for Dickon's garden.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) `taters and cabbages is twice th' size of any one else's an' they've got a flavor with 'em as nobody's has.
<p/>Anything'll grow for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sowerby</b></font>)</div>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) found a moment to spare she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) liked to go out and talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<p/>After supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) quiet time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) could sit upon the low rough wall and look on and hear stories of the day.
<p/>Dickon had bought penny packages of flower seeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among gooseberry bushes and even cabbages
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) grew borders of mignonette and pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could save year after year or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time into fine clumps.
<p/>The low wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire because he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock-cress and hedgerow flowers into every crevice until only here and there glimpses of the stones were to be seen.
<p/>All a chap's got to do to make 'em thrive, mother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``is to be friends with 'em for sure.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loved this time. There were not only vegetables in this garden. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They're just like th' `creatures.' If they're thirsty give 'em drink and if they're hungry give 'em a bit o' food.
<p/>They want to live same as we do. If they died I should feel as if I'd been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless.
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was only told that <div class="bookquote">``Mester Colin''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds with Miss Mary and that it was doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) good.
<p/>But it was not long before it was agreed between the two children that Dickon's mother might <div class="bookquote">``come into the secret.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon mother</b></font>)</div>It was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all that happened at Misselthwaite Manor. '' Somehow it was not doubted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``safe for sure.
<p/>Dickon told the whole story, with all the thrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray haze which had seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had planned never to reveal.
<p/>The coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>), the doubt of Mester Colin and the final drama of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) introduction to the hidden domain, combined with the incident of Ben Weatherstaff's angry face peering over the wall and Mester Colin's sudden indignant strength, made Mrs. Sowerby's nice-looking face quite change color several times.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So one beautiful still evening '' My word!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) said. '' It was a good thing that little lass came to th' Manor.
<p/>It's been th' makin' o ' her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) an' th' savin, o' him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). Standin' on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feet! An' us all thinkin' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was a poor half-witted lad with not a straight bone in him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) asked a great many questions and her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) blue eyes were full of deep thinking. '' What do they make of it at th' Manor--
<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) being so well an' cheerful an' never complainin'? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) inquired. '' They don't know what to make of it,'' answered Dickon.
<p/>'' Every day as comes round his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face looks different. It's fillin' out and doesn't look so sharp an' th' waxy color is goin'.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) has to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) bit o' complainin','' with a highly entertained grin. '' What for, i' Mercy's name? '' asked Mrs. Sowerby.
<p/>Dickon chuckled. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) does it to keep them from guessin' what's happened. If the doctor knew he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'d found out he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could stand on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) feet he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'d likely write and tell Mester Craven.
<p/>Mester Colin's savin' th' secret to tell himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s goin' to practise his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) Magic on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) legs every day till his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) father comes back
<p/>But him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) an' Miss Mary thinks it's best plan to do a bit o' groanin' an' frettin' now an' then to throw folk off th' scent.
<p/>an' then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s goin' to march into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room an' show him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s as straight as other lads. '' Mrs. Sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) last sentence.
<p/>'' Eh!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that pair's enjoyin' their-selves I'll warrant. They'll get a good bit o ' actin' out of it an' there's
<p/>nothin' children likes as much as play actin'. Let's hear what they do, Dickon lad. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Dickon stopped weeding and sat up on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) heels to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) eyes were twinkling with fun. '' Mester Colin is carried down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chair every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) goes out,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) explained.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) makes himself as helpless lookin' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) can an' never lifts his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) head until we're out o' sight o' th' house.
<p/>'' An' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) flies out at John, th' footman, for not carryin' him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) careful enough. An' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) grunts an' frets a good bit when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s bein' settled into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chair.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) an' Miss Mary's both got to enjoyin' it an' when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) groans an' complains she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'ll say, `Poor Colin! Does it hurt you so much?
<p/>Are you so weak as that, poor Colin?'--but th' trouble is that sometimes they can scarce keep from burstin' out laughin'.
<p/>An' they have to stuff their faces into Mester Colin's cushions to keep the gardeners from hearin', if any of, 'em's about.''
<p/>When we get safe into the garden they laugh till they've no breath left to laugh with. '' Th' more they laugh th' better for 'em!'' said Mrs. Sowerby, still laughing herself.
<p/>'' Good healthy child laughin's better than pills any day o' th' year. That pair'll plump up for sure.'' '' They are plumpin' up,'' said Dickon.
<p/>'' They're that hungry they don't know how to get enough to eat without makin' talk. Mester Colin says if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) keeps sendin' for more food they won't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s an invalid at all.
<p/>Miss Mary says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'ll let him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eat her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) share, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) says that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) goes hungry she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'ll get thin an' they mun both get fat at once.
<p/>Mrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) quite rocked backward and forward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) blue cloak, and Dickon laughed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>).
<p/>'' '' I'll tell thee what, lad,'' Mrs. Sowerby said when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) could speak. '' I've thought of a way to help 'em.
<p/>When tha' goes to 'em in th' mornin's tha' shall take a pail o' good new milk an' I'll bake 'em a crusty cottage loaf or some buns
<p/>Then they could take off th' edge o' their hunger while they were in their garden an' th, fine food they get indoors `ud polish off th' corners.
<p/>wi' currants in 'em, same as you children like. Nothin's so good as fresh milk an' bread. '' <div class="bookquote">``Eh! mother! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon admiringly, <div class="bookquote">``what a wonder tha' art!
<p/>Tha' always sees a way out o' things. They was quite in a pother yesterday. They didn't see how they was to manage without orderin' up more food--they felt that empty inside.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div><p/>'' They're two young `uns growin' fast, an' health's comin' back to both of 'em. Children like that feels like young wolves an' food's flesh an' blood to 'em,'' said Mrs. Sowerby.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother creature--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) had never been more so than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) said their <div class="bookquote">``play actin'
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) smiled Dickon's own curving smile. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Eh! but they're enjoyin' theirselves for sure,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) said. '' would be their joy.
<p/>The idea of protecting themselves from suspicion had been unconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled nurse and then by Dr. Craven himself.
<p/>Colin and Mary found it one of their most thrilling sources of entertainment. '' Your appetite. Is improving very much, Master Colin,'' the nurse had said one day.
<p/>Nothing disagrees with me now'' replied Colin, and then seeing the nurse looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) curiously he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) suddenly remembered that perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) ought not to appear too well just yet.
<p/>'' You used to eat nothing, and so many things disagreed with you.'' '' '' At least things don't so often disagree with me.
<p/>It's the fresh air. '' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the nurse</b></font>)</div>said the nurse, still looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with a mystified expression. '' But I must talk to Dr. Craven about it.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) stared at you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went away. '' As if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought there must be something to find out.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I won't have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) finding out things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin. '' No one must begin to find out yet. '' When Dr. Craven came that morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) seemed puzzled, also.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) asked a number of questions, to Colin's great annoyance. '' You stay out in the garden a great deal,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) suggested.
<p/>'' Where do you go? '' Colin put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) favorite air of dignified indifference to opinion. '' I will not let any one know where I go,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'' I go to a place I like. Every one has orders to keep out of the way. I won't be watched and stared at.
<p/>You know that!'' <div class="bookquote">``You seem to be out all day but I do not think it has done you harm--I do not think so.
<p/>The nurse says that you eat much more than you have ever done before. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div>said Colin, prompted by a sudden inspiration, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps it is an unnatural appetite.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do not think so, as your food seems to agree with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Craven. '' You are gaining flesh rapidly and your color is better.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps--perhaps I am bloated and feverish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin, assuming a discouraging air of gloom. '' People who are not going to live are often--different.
<p/>'' Dr. Craven shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was holding Colin's wrist and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pushed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sleeve and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) arm.
<p/>'' You are not feverish,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``and such flesh as you have gained is healthy. If you can keep this up, my boy, we need not talk of dying.
<p/>Your father will be happy to hear of this remarkable improvement.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I won't have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told!''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>Colin broke forth fiercely. ''
<p/>It will only disappoint him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) if I get worse again--and I may get worse this very night. I might have a raging fever.
<p/>I feel as if I might be beginning to have one now. I won't have letters written to my father-- I won't--
<p/>I won't! You are making me angry and you know that is bad for me. I feel hot already. I hate being written about and being talked over as much as I hate being stared at!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush-h! my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>Dr. Craven soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>). '' Nothing shall be written without your permission. You are too sensitive about things.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said no more about writing to Mr. Craven and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) saw the nurse he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) privately warned her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) that such a possibility must not be mentioned to the patient.
<p/>You must not undo the good which has been done. '' '' The boy is extraordinarily better,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) advance seems almost abnormal.
<p/>But of course he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is doing now of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own free will what we could not make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) do before. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) excites himself very easily and nothing must be said to irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>'' Mary and Colin were much alarmed and talked together anxiously. From this time dated their plan of <div class="bookquote">``play actin'. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may be obliged to have a tantrum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin regretfully. '' I don't want to have one and I'm not miserable enough now to work myself into a big one.
<p/>Perhaps I couldn't have one at all. That lump doesn't come in my throat now and I keep thinking of nice things instead of horrible ones.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mind to eat less, but unfortunately it was not possible to carry out this brilliant idea when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wakened each morning with an amazing appetite and the table near his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sofa was set with a breakfast of home-made bread and fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam and clotted cream.
<p/>Mary always breakfasted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and when they found themselves at the table--particularly if there were delicate slices of sizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silver cover--they would look into each other's eyes in desperation.
<p/>But if they talk about writing to my father I shall have to do something. '' '' I think we shall have to eat it all this morning, Mary,'' Colin always ended by saying.
<p/>But they never found they could send away anything and the highly polished condition of the empty plates returned to the pantry awakened much comment.
<p/>I do wish,'' Colin would say also, <div class="bookquote">``I do wish the slices of ham were thicker, and one muffin each is not enough for any one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div><p/>It's enough for a person who is going to die,'' answered Mary when first she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard this, <div class="bookquote">``but it's not enough for a person who is going to live.
<p/>I sometimes feel as if I could eat three when those nice fresh heather and gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open window.
<p/>The morning that Dickon--after they had been enjoying themselves in the garden for about two hours--went behind a big rosebush and brought forth two tin pails and revealed that one was full of rich new milk with cream on the top of it, and that the other held cottage-made currant buns folded in a clean blue and white napkin, buns so carefully tucked in that they were still hot, there was a riot of surprised joyfulness.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>We can send away some of the lunch and a great deal of the dinner. '' '' '' '' What a wonderful thing for Mrs. Sowerby to think of!
<p/>What a kind, clever woman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must be! How good the buns were! And what delicious fresh milk! '' Magic is in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) just as it is in Dickon,'' said Colin.
<p/>'' It makes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) think of ways to do things--nice things. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a Magic person. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) we are grateful, Dickon--extremely grateful.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was given to using rather grown-up phrases at times. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) enjoyed them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) liked this so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) improved upon it.
<p/>And then forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) grandeur he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) fell to and stuffed himself with buns and drank milk out of the pail in copious draughts in the manner of any hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise and breathing in moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours behind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>'' Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme. '' This was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind.
<p/>that as Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen people to provide food for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) might not have enough to satisfy two extra appetites every day.
<p/>They actually awoke to the fact So they asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) to let them send some of their shillings to buy things.
<p/>Dickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the park outside the garden where Mary had first found him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) piping to the wild creatures there was a deep little hollow where you could build a sort of tiny oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it.
<p/>Roasted eggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt and fresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king--besides being deliciously satisfying.
<p/>You could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat as many as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of the mouths of fourteen people.
<p/>Every beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle under the plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after its brief blossom-time was ended.
<p/>After the ceremony Colin always took his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) walking exercise and throughout the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) exercised his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) newly found power at intervals.
<p/>Each day he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) grew stronger and could walk more steadily and cover more ground. And each day his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) belief in the Magic grew stronger--as well it might.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tried one experiment after another as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt himself gaining strength and it was Dickon who showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) the best things of all.
<p/>'' Yesterday,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said one morning after an absence, <div class="bookquote">``I went to Thwaite for mother an' near th' Blue Cow Inn
<p/>I seed Bob Haworth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Haworth</b></font>)'s the strongest chap on th' moor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Haworth</b></font>)'s the champion wrestler an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Haworth</b></font>) can jump higher than any other chap an' throw th' hammer farther.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s knowed me ever since I was a little `un an' he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s a friendly sort an' I axed him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) some questions.
<p/>Th' gentry calls him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) a athlete and I thought o' thee, Mester Colin, and I says, `How did tha' make tha' muscles stick out that way, Bob?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s gone all th' way to Scotland for th' sports some years. Did tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?'
<p/>A strong man in a show that came to Thwaite once showed me how to exercise my arms an' legs an' every muscle in my body.
<p/>An' I says, `Could a delicate chap make himself stronger with 'em, Bob?' an' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) laughed an' says, `Art tha' th' delicate chap?'
<p/>an' I says, `No, but I knows a young gentleman that's gettin' well of a long illness an' I wish I knowed some o' them tricks to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) about.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s friendly same as I said an' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stood up an' showed me good-natured like, an' I imitated what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did till I knowed it by heart.
<p/>An' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) says `Well, yes, lad, I did. I didn't say no names an' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) didn't ask none. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Colin had been listening excitedly.
<p/>'' Can you show me? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried. '' Will you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Aye, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>Dickon answered, getting up. '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) says tha' mun do 'em gentle at first
<p/>an' be careful not to tire thysel'. Rest in between times an' take deep breaths an' don't overdo. '' <div class="bookquote">``I'll be careful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Show me! Show me! Dickon, you are the most Magic boy in the world!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>Dickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefully practical but simple series of muscle exercises.
<p/>Colin watched them with widening eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could do a few while he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was sitting down. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did a few gently while he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stood upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) already steadied feet.
<p/>Soot, who was watching the performance, became much disturbed and left his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) branch and hopped about restlessly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could not do them too.
<p/>Mary began to do them also. From that time the exercises were part of the day's duties as much as the Magic was.
<p/>It became possible for both Colin and Mary to do more of them each time they tried, and such appetites were the results that but for the basket Dickon put down behind the bush each morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) arrived they would have been lost.
<p/>But the little oven in the hollow and Mrs. Sowerby's bounties were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and the nurse and Dr. Craven became mystified again.
<p/>You can trifle with your breakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the brim with roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new milk and oatcakes and buns and heather honey and clotted cream.
<p/>'' They are eating next to nothing,'' said the nurse. '' They'll die of starvation if they can't be persuaded to take some nourishment.
<p/>And yet see how they look. '' <div class="bookquote">``Look! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly. '' Eh! I'm moithered to death with them.
<p/>Bursting their jackets one day and the next turning up their noses at the best meals Cook can tempt them with.
<p/>They're a pair of young Satans. Not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and bread sauce did they set a fork into yesterday--and the poor woman fair invented a pudding for them--and back it's sent.
<p/>Dr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully, He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wore an extremely worried expression when the nurse talked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) the almost untouched tray of breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had saved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) to look at--but it was even more worried when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sat down by Colin's sofa and examined him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) almost cried. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)'s afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)'ll be blamed if they starve themselves into their graves. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been called to London on business and had not seen the boy for nearly two weeks.
<p/>The waxen tinge had left, Colins skin and a warm rose showed through it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) beautiful eyes were clear and the hollows under them and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cheeks and temples had filled out.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) once dark, heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily from his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) forehead and were soft and warm with life.
<p/>When young things begin to gain health they gain it rapidly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lips were fuller and of a normal color. In fact as an imitation of a boy who was a confirmed invalid he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a disgraceful sight.
<p/>Dr. Craven held his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) chin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hand and thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) over. '' I am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' That will not do. You will lose all you have gained--and you have gained amazingly. You ate so well a short time ago.''
<p/>Mary was sitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stool nearby and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) suddenly made a very queer sound which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tried so violently to repress that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ended by almost choking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you it was an unnatural appetite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>answered Colin. '' What is the matter?'' said Dr. Craven, turning to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>Mary became quite severe in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) manner. '' It was something between a sneeze and a cough,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) replied with reproachful dignity, <div class="bookquote">``and it got into my throat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It just burst out because all at once I couldn't help remembering that last big potato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit through that thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it.''
<p/>'' But,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said afterward to Colin, ``I couldn't stop myself. <div class="bookquote">``Is there any way in which those children can get food secretly?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>Dr. Craven inquired of Mrs. Medlock. '' There's no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off the trees,'' Mrs. Medlock answered.
<p/>'' They stay out in the grounds all day and see no one but each other. And if they want anything different to eat from what's sent up to them they need only ask for it.''
<p/>'' Well,'' said Dr. Craven, <div class="bookquote">``so long as going without food agrees with them we need not disturb ourselves. The boy is a new creature.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div><p/>'' So is the girl,'' said Mrs. Medlock. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'s begun to be downright pretty since she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'s filled out and lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) ugly little sour look.
<p/>The glummest, ill-natured little thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) used to be and now her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) and Master Colin laugh together like a pair of crazy young ones.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) hair's grown thick and healthy looking and she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>)'s got a bright color. Perhaps they're growing fat on that.'' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Craven</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Craven.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let them laugh. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXV THE CURTAIN And the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed new miracles.
<p/>In the robin's nest there were Eggs and the robin's mate sat upon them keeping them warm with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) feathery little breast and careful wings.
<p/>Even Dickon did not go near the close-grown corner in those days, but waited until by the quiet working of some mysterious spell he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) seemed to have conveyed to the soul of the little pair that in the garden there was nothing which was not quite like themselves--nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of what was happening to them--the immense, tender, terrible, heart-breaking beauty and solemnity of Eggs.
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) was very nervous and the robin himself was indignantly watchful. If there had been one person in that garden who had not known through all his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>)
<p/>or her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) innermost being that if an Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round and crash through space and come to an end--if there had been even one who did not feel it and act accordingly there could have been no happiness even in that golden springtime air.
<p/>But they all knew it and felt it and the robin and his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mate knew they knew it. At first the robin watched Mary and Colin with sharp anxiety.
<p/>The first moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dew-bright black eye on Dickon he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was not a stranger but a sort of robin without beak or feathers.
<p/>For some mysterious reason he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) need not watch Dickon. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) could speak robin -LRB-which is a quite distinct language not to be mistaken for any other-RRB-.
<p/>Dickon always spoke it to the robin himself, so the queer gibberish he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) used when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) spoke to humans did not matter in the least.
<p/>To speak robin to a robin is like speaking French to a Frenchman. The robin thought he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) spoke this gibberish to them because they were not intelligent enough to understand feathered speech.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) movements also were robin. They never startled one by being sudden enough to seem dangerous or threatening. Any robin could understand Dickon, so his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) presence was not even disturbing.
<p/>But at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard against the other two. In the first place the boy creature did not come into the garden on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) legs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was pushed in on a thing with wheels and the skins of wild animals were thrown over him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). That in itself was doubtful.
<p/>Then when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began to stand up and move about he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did it in a queer unaccustomed way and the others seemed to have to help him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>The robin used to secrete himself in a bush and watch this anxiously, his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) head tilted first on one side and then on the other.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) thought that the slow movements might mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was preparing to pounce, as cats do. When cats are preparing to pounce they creep over the ground very slowly.
<p/>The robin talked this over with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mate a great deal for a few days but after that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) decided not to speak of the subject because her (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) terror was so great that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was afraid it might be injurious to the Eggs.
<p/>When the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly it was an immense relief. But for a long time--or it seemed a long time to the robin--he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was a source of some anxiety.
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had a way of sitting or lying down for a while and then getting up in a disconcerting manner to begin again.
<p/>One day the robin remembered that when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) himself had been made to learn to fly by his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) parents he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had done much the same sort of thing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) did not act as the other humans did. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) seemed very fond of walking He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) had taken short flights of a few yards and then had been obliged to rest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mentioned this to his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mate and when he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) that the Eggs would probably conduct themselves in the same way after they were fledged she (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was quite comforted and even became eagerly interested and derived great pleasure from watching the boy over the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) nest--though she (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) always thought that the Eggs would be much cleverer and learn more quickly.
<p/>But then she (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) said indulgently that humans were always more clumsy and slow than Eggs and most of them never seemed really to learn to fly at all.
<p/>So it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that this boy was learning to fly--or rather to walk. You never met them in the air or on tree-tops.
<p/>After a while the boy began to move about as the others did, but all three of the children at times did unusual things.
<p/>They would stand under the trees and move their arms and legs and heads about in a way which was neither walking nor running nor sitting down.
<p/>They went through these movements at intervals every day and the robin was never able to explain to his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mate what they were doing or tying to do.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) could only say that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was sure that the Eggs would never flap about in such a manner; but as the boy who could speak robin so fluently was doing the thing with them, birds could be quite sure that the actions were not of a dangerous nature.
<p/>Of course neither the robin nor his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) mate had ever heard of the champion wrestler, Bob Haworth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Haworth</b></font>) exercises for making the muscles stand out like lumps.
<p/>Robins are not like human beings; their muscles are always exercised from the first and so they develop themselves in a natural manner.
<p/>If you have to fly about to find every meal you eat, your muscles do not become atrophied -LRB-atrophied means wasted away through want of use-RRB-.
<p/>When the boy was walking and running about and digging and weeding like the others, the nest in the corner was brooded over by a great peace and content.
<p/>Knowing that your Eggs were as safe as if they were locked in a bank vault and the fact that you could watch so many curious things going on made setting a most entertaining occupation.
<p/>On wet days the Eggs' mother sometimes felt even a little dull because the children did not come into the garden.
<p/>Fears for the Eggs became things of the past. But even on wet days it could not be said that Mary and Colin were dull.
<p/>One morning when the rain streamed down unceasingly and Colin was beginning to feel a little restive, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was obliged to remain on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sofa because it was not safe to get up and walk about, Mary had an inspiration.
<p/>Now that I am a real boy,'' Colin had said, <div class="bookquote">``my legs and arms and all my body are so full of Magic that I can't keep them still.
<p/>Do you know that when I waken in the morning, Mary, when it's quite early and the birds are just shouting outside and everything seems just shouting for joy--even the trees and things we can't really hear--I feel as if I must jump out of bed and shout myself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>They want to be doing things all the time. If I did it, just think what would happen! '' Mary giggled inordinately.
<p/>'' The nurse would come running and Mrs. Medlock would come running and they would be sure you had gone crazy
<p/>and they'd send for the doctor,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) said. Colin giggled himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could see how they would all look--how horrified by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) outbreak and how amazed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) standing upright.
<p/>'' I wish my father would come home,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said. '' I want to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) myself. I'm always thinking about it--but we couldn't go on like this much longer.
<p/>I can't stand lying still and pretending, and besides I look too different. I wish it wasn't raining today. '' It was then Mistress Mary had her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) inspiration.
<p/>'' Colin,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began mysteriously, <div class="bookquote">``do you know how many rooms there are in this house?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' About a thousand, I suppose,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'' There's about a hundred no one ever goes into,'' said Mary. '' And one rainy day I went and looked into ever so many of them.
<p/>No one ever knew, though Mrs. Medlock nearly found me out. I lost my way when I was coming back and I stopped at the end of your corridor.
<p/>That was the second time I heard you crying. '' Colin started up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sofa. '' A hundred rooms no one goes into,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' It sounds almost like a secret garden. Suppose we go and look at them. Wheel me in my chair and nobody would know we went.
<p/>'' '' That's what I was thinking,'' said Mary. '' No one would dare to follow us. There are galleries where you could run.
<p/>We could do our exercises. There is a little Indian room where there is a cabinet full of ivory elephants. There are all sorts of rooms.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ring the bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin. When the nurse came in he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) orders. '' I want my chair,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Miss Mary and I are going to look at the part of the house which is not used. John can push me as far as the picture-gallery because there are some stairs.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) must go away and leave us alone until I send for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) again. '' Rainy days lost their terrors that morning.
<p/>When the footman had wheeled the chair into the picture-gallery and left the two together in obedience to orders, Colin and Mary looked at each other delighted.
<p/>As soon as Mary had made sure that John was really on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way back to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own quarters below stairs, Colin got out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chair.
<p/>'' I am going to run from one end of the gallery to the other,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and then I am going to jump
<p/>They looked at the portraits and found the plain little girl dressed in green brocade and holding the parrot on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) finger.
<p/>and then we will do Bob Haworth's exercises. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And they did all these things and many others. '' All these,'' said Colin, <div class="bookquote">``must be my relations.
<p/>They lived a long time ago. That parrot one, I believe, is one of my great, great, great, great aunts. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks rather like you, Mary--not as you look now but as you looked when you came here.
<p/>Now you are a great deal fatter and better looking.''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>'' So are you,'' said Mary, and they both laughed. They went to the Indian room and amused themselves with the ivory elephants.
<p/>They found the rose-colored brocade boudoir and the hole in the cushion the mouse had left, but the mice had grown up and run away and the hole was empty.
<p/>They found new corridors and corners and flights of steps and new old pictures they liked and weird old things they did not know the use of.
<p/>It was a curiously entertaining morning and the feeling of wandering about in the same house with other people but at the same time feeling as if one were miles away from them was a fascinating thing.
<p/>They saw more rooms and made more discoveries than Mary had made on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) first pilgrimage. '' I'm glad we came,'' Colin said.
<p/>'' I never knew I lived in such a big queer old place. I like it. We will ramble about every rainy day.
<p/>That morning they had found among other things such good appetites that when they returned to Colin's room it was not possible to send the luncheon away untouched.
<p/>When the nurse carried the tray down-stairs she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) slapped it down on the kitchen dresser so that Mrs. Loomis, the cook, could see the highly polished dishes and plates.
<p/>We shall always be finding new queer corners and things. '' '' Look at that!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Loomis</b></font>) said. '' This is a house of mystery, and those two children are the greatest mysteries in it.''
<p/>If they keep that up every day,'' said the strong young footman John, <div class="bookquote">``there'd be small wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) weighs twice as much to-day as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did a month ago.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>I should have to give up my place in time, for fear of doing my muscles an injury. '' That afternoon Mary noticed that something new had happened in Colin's room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had noticed it the day before but had said nothing because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought the change might have been made by chance.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said nothing today but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat and looked fixedly at the picture over the mantel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could look at it because the curtain had been drawn aside.
<p/>That was the change she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) noticed. '' I know what you want me to tell you,'' said Colin, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had stared a few minutes.
<p/>'' I always know when you want me to tell you something. You are wondering why the curtain is drawn back.
<p/>I am going to keep it like that. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>asked Mary. ``Because it doesn't make me angry any more to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) laughing.
<p/>I wakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if the Magic was filling the room and making everything so splendid that I couldn't lie still.
<p/>The room was quite light and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain and somehow that made me go and pull the cord.
<p/>I got up and looked out of the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked right down at me as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were laughing because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was glad I was standing there.
<p/>It made me like to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). I want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) laughing like that all the time. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must have been a sort of Magic person perhaps.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``that sometimes I think perhaps you are her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ghost made into a boy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>'' That idea seemed to impress Colin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thought it over and then answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) slowly. '' If I were her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ghost--my father would be fond of me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be fond of you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div>inquired Mary. '' I used to hate it because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not fond of me.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grew fond of me I think I should tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) about the Magic. It might make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) more cheerful.
<p/>'' CHAPTER XXVI <div class="bookquote">``IT'S MOTHER! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Magic</b></font>)</div>Their belief in the Magic was an abiding thing. After the morning's incantations Colin sometimes gave them Magic lectures.
<p/>I like to do it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``because when I grow up and make great scientific discoveries I shall be obliged to lecture about them and so this is practise.
<p/>I can only give short lectures now because I am very young, and besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) were in church and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) would go to sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Th' best thing about lecturin','' said Ben, <div class="bookquote">``is that a chap can get up an' say aught he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) pleases an' no other chap can answer him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) back.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>'' I wouldn't be agen' lecturin' a bit mysel' sometimes. '' But when Colin held forth under his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tree old Ben fixed devouring eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) and kept them there.
<p/>It was not so much the lecture which interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) as the legs which looked straighter and stronger each day, the boyish head which held itself up so well, the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks which had filled and rounded out and the eyes which had begun to hold the light he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) remembered in another pair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) over with critical affection. Sometimes when Colin felt Ben's earnest gaze meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was much impressed he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) wondered what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was reflecting on
<p/>and once when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) had seemed quite entranced he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>). '' What are you thinking about, Ben Weatherstaff? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) asked.
<p/>'' I was thinkin''' answered Ben, <div class="bookquote">``as I'd warrant tha's, gone up three or four pound this week. I was lookin' at tha' calves an' tha' shoulders.
<p/>I'd like to get thee on a pair o' scales.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>'' It's the Magic and--and Mrs. Sowerby's buns and milk and things,'' said Colin.
<p/>'' You see the scientific experiment has succeeded. '' That morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) came he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was ruddy with running and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) funny face looked more twinkling than usual.
<p/>As they had a good deal of weeding to do after the rains they fell to work. They always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinking rain.
<p/>The moisture which was good for the flowers was also good for the weeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of leaves which must be pulled up before their roots took too firm hold.
<p/>Colin was as good at weeding as any one in these days and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could lecture while he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was doing it.
<p/>'' The Magic works best when you work, yourself,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said this morning. '' You can feel it in your bones and muscles.
<p/>I am going to read books about bones and muscles, but I am going to write a book about Magic. I am making it up now.
<p/>It was not very long after he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had said this that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) trowel and stood up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been silent for several minutes and they had seen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was thinking out lectures, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) often did.
<p/>I keep finding out things. '' When he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) trowel and stood upright it seemed to Mary and Dickon as if a sudden strong thought had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) do it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stretched himself out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tallest height and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) threw out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) arms exultantly. Color glowed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) strange eyes widened with joyfulness.
<p/>All at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had realized something to the full. '' Mary! Dickon! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried. '' Just look at me!''
<p/>They stopped their weeding and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>). '' Do you remember that first morning you brought me in here? ''
<p/>Being an animal charmer he (<font color='blue'><b>charmer</b></font>) could see more things than most people could and many of them were things he (<font color='blue'><b>charmer</b></font>) never talked about.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>charmer</b></font>) demanded. Dickon was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>charmer</b></font>) very hard. He (<font color='blue'><b>charmer</b></font>) saw some of them now in this boy. '' Aye, that we do,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>charmer</b></font>) answered.
<p/>Just this minute,'' said Colin, <div class="bookquote">``all at once I remembered it myself--when I looked at my hand digging with the trowel--and I had to stand up on my feet to see if it was real.
<p/>Mary looked hard too, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said nothing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>And it is real! I'm well--I'm well!'' <div class="bookquote">``Aye, that th' art!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>said Dickon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had known it before in a way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had hoped it and felt it and thought about it, but just at that minute something had rushed all through him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)--a sort of rapturous belief and realization
<p/>'' I'm well! I'm well!'' said Colin again, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face went quite red all over. and it had been so strong that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could not help calling out.
<p/>'' I shall live forever and ever and ever!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cried grandly. '' I shall find out thousands and thousands of things.
<p/>I shall find out about people and creatures and everything that grows--like Dickon--and I shall never stop making Magic. I'm well!
<p/>I'm well! I feel--I feel as if I want to shout out something--something thankful, joyful!'' Ben Weatherstaff, who had been working near a rose-bush, glanced round at him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>).
<p/>'' Tha' might sing th' Doxology,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) suggested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) dryest grunt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had no opinion of the Doxology and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) did not make the suggestion with any particular reverence.
<p/>But Colin was of an exploring mind and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew nothing about the Doxology. '' What is that?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) inquired. ''
<p/>Dickon can sing it for thee, I'll warrant,'' replied Ben Weatherstaff. Dickon answered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) all-perceiving animal charmer's smile. '' They sing it i' church,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Mother says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) believes th' skylarks sings it when they gets up i' th' mornin'. '' '' If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) says that, it must be a nice song,'' Colin answered.
<p/>'' I've never been in a church myself. I was always too ill. Sing it, Dickon. I want to hear it.
<p/>'' Dickon was quite simple and unaffected about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) understood what Colin felt better than Colin did himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) understood by a sort of instinct so natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not know it was understanding.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cap and looked round still smiling. '' Tha' must take off tha' cap,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said to Colin, <div class="bookquote">``an' so mun tha',
<p/>Ben--an' tha' mun stand up, tha' knows. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>Colin took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cap and the sun shone on and warmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thick hair as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) watched Dickon intently.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff scrambled up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) knees and bared his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) head too with a sort of puzzled half-resentful look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) old face as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) didn't know exactly why he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was doing this remarkable thing.
<p/>Dickon stood out among the trees and rose-bushes and began to sing in quite a simple matter-of-fact way and in a nice strong boy voice:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Praise God from whom all blessings flow, Praise Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) all creatures here below, Praise Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) above ye Heavenly Host, Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) had finished, Ben Weatherstaff was standing quite still with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) jaws set obstinately but with a disturbed look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) eyes fixed on Colin.
<p/>Amen. ''  (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div>Colin's face was thoughtful and appreciative. '' It is a very nice song,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said. '' I like it.
<p/>Perhaps it means just what I mean when I want to shout out that I am thankful to the Magic. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stopped and thought in a puzzled way. '' Perhaps they are both the same thing. How can we know the exact names of everything?
<p/>Sing it again, Dickon. Let us try, Mary. I want to sing it, too. It's my song. How does it begin? '
<p/>And they sang it again, and Mary and Colin lifted their voices as musically as they could and Dickon's swelled quite loud and beautiful--and at the second line Ben Weatherstaff raspingly cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) throat and at the third line he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) joined in with such vigor that it seemed almost savage and when the <div class="bookquote">``Amen''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>came to an end Mary observed that the very same thing had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) which had happened when he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) found out that Colin was not a cripple--his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chin was twitching and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was staring and winking and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) leathery old cheeks were wet.
<p/>Praise God from whom all blessings flow'? '' '' I never seed no sense in th' Doxology afore,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said hoarsely, <div class="bookquote">``but I may change my mind i' time.
<p/>I should say tha'd gone up five pound this week Mester Colin--five on 'em!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Colin was looking across the garden at something attracting his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) attention and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) expression had become a startled one.
<p/>'' Who is coming in here? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said quickly. '' Who is it? '' The door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open and a woman had entered.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had come in with the last line of their song and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had stood still listening and looking at them.
<p/>With the ivy behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), the sunlight drifting through the trees and dappling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) long blue cloak, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nice fresh face smiling across the greenery she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was rather like a softly colored illustration in one of Colin's books.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had wonderful affectionate eyes which seemed to take everything in--all of them, even Ben Weatherstaff and the <div class="bookquote">``creatures''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>and every flower that was in bloom.
<p/>Unexpectedly as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had appeared, not one of them felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was an intruder at all. Dickon's eyes lighted like lamps.
<p/>'' It's mother-- that's who it is!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) cried and went across the grass at a run. Colin began to move toward her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), too, and Mary went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>They both felt their pulses beat faster. '' It's mother!'' Dickon said again when they met halfway. '' I knowed tha' wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) an' I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) where th' door was hid.''
<p/>Colin held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand with a sort of flushed royal shyness but his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes quite devoured her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face. '' Even when I was ill
<p/>I wanted to see you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you and Dickon and the secret garden. I'd never wanted to see any one or anything before.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) uplifted face brought about a sudden change in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) flushed and the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mouth shook and a mist seemed to sweep over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' Eh! dear lad! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) broke out tremulously. '' Eh! dear lad!'' as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had not known she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were going to say it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might have said it to Dickon in the same way if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had seen something in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) face which touched her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not say, <div class="bookquote">``Mester Colin,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>but just <div class="bookquote">``dear lad''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>quite suddenly. Colin liked it. '' Are you surprised because I am so well?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) shoulder and smiled the mist out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes. '' Aye, that I am!
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but tha`rt so like thy mother tha' made my heart jump.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin a little awkwardly, <div class="bookquote">``that will make my father like me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, for sure, dear lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) shoulder a soft quick pat. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mun come home--he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mun come home.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Susan Sowerby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben Weatherstaff, getting close to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). '' Look at th' lad's legs, wilt tha'? They was like drumsticks
<p/>i' stockin' two month' ago-- an' I heard folk tell as they was bandy an' knock-kneed both at th' same time.
<p/>Look at 'em now!'' Susan Sowerby laughed a comfortable laugh. '' They're goin' to be fine strong lad's legs in a bit,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Let him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) go on playin' an' workin' in the garden an' eatin' hearty an' drinkin' plenty o' good sweet milk
<p/>an' there'll not be a finer pair i' Yorkshire, thank God for it. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put both hands on Mistress Mary's shoulders and looked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little face over in a motherly fashion.
<p/>'' An' thee, too! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. '' Tha`rt grown near as hearty as our `Lisabeth Ellen. I'll warrant tha`rt like thy mother too.
<p/>Our Martha told me as Mrs. Medlock heard she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was a pretty woman. Tha`lt be like a blush rose when tha' grows up, my little lass, bless thee.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) did not mention that when Martha came home on her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``day out''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>and described the plain sallow child she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) had no confidence
<p/>It doesn't stand to reason that a pretty woman could be th' mother o' such a fou' little lass,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) had added obstinately.
<p/>'' whatever in what Mrs. Medlock had heard. '' Mary had not had time to pay much attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) changing face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had only known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked <div class="bookquote">``different''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and seemed to have a great deal more hair and that it was growing very fast.
<p/>But remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pleasure in looking at the Mem Sahib in the past she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was glad to hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might some day look like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>Susan Sowerby went round their garden with them and was told the whole story of it and shown every bush and tree which had come alive.
<p/>Each of them kept looking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) comfortable rosy face, secretly curious about the delightful feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gave them--a sort of warm, supported feeling.
<p/>Colin walked on one side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and Mary on the other. It seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) understood them as Dickon understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``creatures.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dickon</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stooped over the flowers and talked about them as if they were children. Soot followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and once or twice cawed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and flew upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) shoulder as if it were Dickon's.
<p/>When they told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) about the robin and the first flight of the young ones she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) laughed a motherly little mellow laugh in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) throat.
<p/>I suppose learnin' 'em to fly is like learnin' children to walk, but I'm feared I should be all in a worrit if mine had wings instead o' legs,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said.
<p/>It was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seemed such a wonderful woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nice moorland cottage way that at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was told about the Magic.
<p/>'' '' Do you believe in Magic? '' asked Colin after he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had explained about Indian fakirs. '' I do hope you do.
<p/>'' '' That I do, lad,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered. '' I never knowed it by that name but what does th' name matter?
<p/>Th' same thing as set th' seeds swellin' an' th' sun shinin' made thee a well lad an' it's th' Good Thing.
<p/>I warrant they call it a different name i' France an' a different one i' Germany. It isn't like us poor fools as think it matters if us is called out of our names.
<p/>Th' Big Good Thing doesn't stop to worrit, bless thee. It goes on makin' worlds by th' million-- worlds like us.
<p/>Never thee stop believin' in th' Big Good Thing an' knowin' th' world's full of it--an' call it what tha' likes.
<p/>Tha' wert singin' to it when I come into th' garden.'' <div class="bookquote">``I felt so joyful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) beautiful strange eyes at her (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>).
<p/>Suddenly I felt how different I was--how strong my arms and legs were, you know--and how I could dig and stand--and I jumped up and wanted to shout out something to anything that would listen.''
<p/>'' '' Th' Magic listened when tha' sung th' Doxology. It would ha' listened to anything tha'd sung. It was th' joy that mattered.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) had packed a basket which held a regular feast this morning, and when the hungry hour came and Dickon brought it out from its hiding place, she (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>) sat down with them under their tree and watched them devour their food, laughing and quite gloating over their appetites.
<p/>Eh! lad, lad--what's names to th' Joy Maker,'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) shoulders a quick soft pat again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) was full of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd things.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) laughed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) could not help it when they told her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) of the increasing difficulty there was in pretending that Colin was still a fretful invalid.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) told them stories in broad Yorkshire and taught them new words. '' You see we can't help laughing nearly all the time when we are together,'' explained Colin.
<p/>'' And it doesn't sound ill at all. We try to choke it back but it will burst out and that sounds worse than ever.''
<p/>There's one thing that comes into my mind so often,'' said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``and I can scarcely ever hold in when I think of it suddenly.
<p/>It isn't like one yet but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) gets a tiny bit fatter every day--and suppose some morning it should look like one--what should we do!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Lennox/Lennox</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I keep thinking suppose Colin's face should get to look like a full moon. <div class="bookquote">``Bless us all, I can see tha' has a good bit o' play actin' to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan Sowerby/Susan/Sowerby</b></font>)</div>said Susan Sowerby.
<p/>'' But tha' won't have to keep it up much longer. Mester Craven'll come home.'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) will?''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>asked Colin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan Sowerby/Susan/Sowerby</b></font>)</div>Susan Sowerby chuckled softly. '' I suppose it `ud nigh break thy heart if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) found out before tha ' told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) in tha' own way,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sowerby</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Tha's laid awake nights plannin' it.'' <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't bear any one else to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin/Mester Colin/COLIN</b></font>)</div>said Colin. '' I think about different ways every day, I think now I just want to run into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room.''
<p/>'' That'd be a fine start for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>),'' said Susan Sowerby. '' I'd like to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face, lad. I would that!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mun come back--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mun. '' One of the things they talked of was the visit they were to make to her (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) cottage.
<p/>They planned it all. They were to drive over the moor and lunch out of doors among the heather. They would see all the twelve children and Dickon's garden and would not come back until they were tired.
<p/>Susan Sowerby got up at last to return to the house and Mrs. Medlock. It was time for Colin to be wheeled back also.
<p/>But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chair he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stood quite close to Susan and fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) with a kind of bewildered adoration
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) suddenly caught hold of the fold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) blue cloak and held it fast. '' You are just what I--what I wanted,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said.
<p/>All at once Susan Sowerby bent down and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) warm arms close against the bosom under the blue cloak--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had been Dickon's brother.
<p/>'' I wish you were my mother--as well as Dickon's! '' The quick mist swept over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes. '' Eh! dear lad!
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. '' Thy own mother's in this `ere very garden, I do believe. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) couldna' keep out of it.
<p/>Thy father mun come back to thee--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mun!'' CHAPTER XXVII IN THE GARDEN In each century since the beginning of the world wonderful things have been discovered.
<p/>In the last century more amazing things were found out than in any century before. In this new century hundreds of things still more astounding will be brought to light.
<p/>At first people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it can be done--then it is done and all the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago.
<p/>One of the new things people began to find out in the last century was that thoughts--just mere thoughts--are as powerful as electric batteries--as good for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison.
<p/>To let a sad thought or a bad one get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever germ get into your body.
<p/>If you let it stay there after it has got in you may never get over it as long as you live.
<p/>So long as Mistress Mary's mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dislikes and sour opinions of people and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) determination not to be pleased by or interested in anything, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a yellow-faced, sickly, bored and wretched child.
<p/>Circumstances, however, were very kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not at all aware of it. They began to push her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) about for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own good.
<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind gradually filled itself with robins, and moorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed old gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime and with secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor boy and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``creatures,''  (<font color='red'><b>a moor boy creatures</b></font>)</div>there was no room left for the disagreeable thoughts which affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liver and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) digestion and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) yellow and tired.
<p/>So long as Colin shut himself up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) room and thought only of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) fears and weakness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) detestation of people who looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and reflected hourly on humps and early death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was a hysterical half-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and the spring and also did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) could get well and could stand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feet if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) tried to do it.
<p/>When new beautiful thoughts began to push out the old hideous ones, life began to come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) blood ran healthily through his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) veins and strength poured into him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) like a flood.
<p/>Much more surprising things can happen to any one who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and there was nothing weird about it at all. Two things cannot be in one place.
<p/>While the secret garden was coming alive and two children were coming alive with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-away beautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains of Switzerland
<p/>'' Where, you tend a rose, my lad, A thistle cannot grow. '' and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was a man who for ten years had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mind filled with dark and heart-broken thinking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had not been courageous; he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of the dark ones.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had wandered by blue lakes and thought them; he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had lain on mountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) and flower breaths filling all the air
<p/>A terrible sorrow had fallen upon him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had been happy and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had let his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) soul fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately to allow any rift of light to pierce through.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) traveled about, darkness so brooded over him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) that the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was a wrong done to other people because it was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) poisoned the air about him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) with gloom.
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had thought them. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had forgotten and deserted his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) home and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) duties. Most strangers thought he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) must be either half mad or a man with some hidden crime on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) soul.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), was a tall man with a drawn face and crooked shoulders and the name he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) always entered on hotel registers was, ``Archibald Craven, Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire, England.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had traveled far and wide since the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) saw Mistress Mary in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) study and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) might have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``bit of earth.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had been in the most beautiful places in Europe, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had remained nowhere more than a few days.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and had looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them with such light as made it seem as if the world were just being born.
<p/>But the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) realized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had happened.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had been walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted, any man's soul out of shadow.
<p/>But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had felt tired and had thrown himself down to rest on a carpet of moss by a stream.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had chosen the quietest and remotest spots. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had walked a long way and it had not lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was a clear little stream which ran quite merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious damp greenness.
<p/>Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low laughter as it bubbled over and round stones. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw birds come and dip their heads to drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away.
<p/>It seemed like a thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper. The valley was very, very still.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Craven gradually felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the valley itself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) were going to sleep, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) eyes began to see things growing at its edge.
<p/>There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots growing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) found himself looking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) remembered he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had looked at such things years ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) did not know that just that simple thought was slowly filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) mind--filling and filling it until other things were softly pushed aside.
<p/>It was as if a sweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen and risen until at last it swept the dark water away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were. But of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) did not think of this himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) only knew that the valley seemed to grow quieter and quieter as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) sat and stared at the bright delicate blueness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) did not know how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) sat there or what was happening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>), but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) moved as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) were awakening and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) got up slowly and stood on the moss carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft breath and wondering at himself.
<p/>Something seemed to have been unbound and released in him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>), very quietly. '' What is it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said, almost in a whisper, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>I do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things to be able to explain how this had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) did not understand at all himself--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) remembered this strange hour months afterward when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was at Misselthwaite again and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) found out quite by accident that on this very day Colin had cried out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) went into the secret garden: <div class="bookquote">``I am going to live forever and ever and ever!
<p/>The singular calmness remained with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) the rest of the evening and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) slept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) very long.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I almost feel as if--I were alive! '' Neither does any one else yet. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not know that it could be kept.
<p/>By the next night he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had opened the doors wide to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) left the valley and went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wandering way again. But, strange as it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>), there were minutes--sometimes half-hours--when, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knowing
<p/>why, the black burden seemed to lift itself again and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was a living man and not a dead one.
<p/>Slowly--slowly--for no reason that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew of --he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``coming alive''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with the garden. As the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) went to the Lake of Como.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) days upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) walked back into the soft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was tired so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) might sleep.
<p/>But by this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had begun to sleep better, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dreams had ceased to be a terror to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>).
<p/>It was growing stronger but--because of the rare peaceful hours when his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thoughts were changed--his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) soul was slowly growing stronger, too.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) found the loveliness of a dream. '' Perhaps,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``my body is growing stronger. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) should not go home.
<p/>Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wondered vaguely about his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) boy and asked himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) should feel when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) went and stood by the carved four-posted bed again and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it slept and, the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes.
<p/>One marvel of a day he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had walked so far that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) returned the moon was high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver.
<p/>The stillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not go into the villa he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) lived in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) walked down to a little bowered terrace at the water's edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the heavenly scents of the night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) shrank from it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) felt the strange calmness stealing over him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and it grew deeper and deeper until he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) fell asleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not know when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) fell asleep and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to dream; his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) dream was so real that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) were dreaming.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) thought that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sat and breathed in the scent of the late roses and listened to the lapping of the water at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) feet he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) heard a voice calling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) remembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) was. It was sweet and clear and happy and far away.
<p/>It seemed very far, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) very side. '' Archie!
<p/>Archie! Archie! '' it said, and then again, sweeter and clearer than before, <div class="bookquote">``Archie! Archie! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Archie</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) feet not even startled.
<p/>It was such a real voice and it seemed so natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) should hear it. '' Lilias! Lilias! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'' Lilias! where are you?'' <div class="bookquote">``In the garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it came back like a sound from a golden flute. '' In the garden!
<p/>'' And then the dream ended. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) did not awaken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) slept soundly and sweetly all through the lovely night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) was an Italian servant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the villa were, to accepting without question any strange thing his (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) foreign master might do.
<p/>No one ever knew when he (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) would go out or come in or where he (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) would choose to sleep or if he (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) would roam about the garden or lie in the boat on the lake all night.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Archie</b></font>) did awake at last it was brilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). The man held a salver with some letters on it and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waited quietly until Mr. Craven took them.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had gone away Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hand and looking at the lake.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) strange calm was still upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) and something more--a lightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had not happened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) thought--as if something had changed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was remembering the dream--the real--real dream. '' In the garden!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said, wondering at himself. '' In the garden! But the door is locked and the key is buried deep.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) glanced at the letters a few minutes later he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) saw that the one lying at the top of the rest was an English letter and came from Yorkshire.
<p/>'' It was directed in a plain woman's hand but it was not a hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the first words attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) attention at once.
<p/>'' Dear Sir: I am Susan Sowerby that made bold to speak to you once on the moor. It was about Miss Mary I spoke.
<p/>I think you would be glad to come and--if you will excuse me, sir--I think your lady would ask you to come if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was here.
<p/>I will make bold to speak again. Please, sir, I would come home if I was you. Your obedient servant, Susan Sowerby.
<p/>'' Mr. Craven read the letter twice before he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) put it back in its envelope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) kept thinking about the dream.
<p/>'' I will go back to Misselthwaite,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said. '' Yes, I'll go at once. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) went through the garden to the villa and ordered Pitcher to prepare for his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) return to England.
<p/>In a few days he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was in Yorkshire again, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) long railroad journey he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) found himself thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) boy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had never thought in all the ten years past.
<p/>During those years he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had only wished to forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>). Now, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) did not intend to think about him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>), memories of him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) constantly drifted into his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) remembered the black days when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had raved like a madman because the child was alive and the mother was dead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had refused to see it, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had gone to look at it at last it had been, such a weak wretched thing that everyone had been sure it would die in a few days.
<p/>But to the surprise of those who took care of it the days passed and it lived and then everyone believed it would be a deformed and crippled creature.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had shrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) own misery.
<p/>The first time after a year's absence he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) returned to Misselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly and indifferently lifted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) face the great gray eyes with black lashes round them,
<p/>so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had adored, he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as death.
<p/>After that he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) scarcely ever saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) except when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was asleep, and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) knew of him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was a confirmed invalid, with a vicious, hysterical, half-insane temper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had not meant to be a bad father, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had not felt like a father at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) could only be kept from furies dangerous to himself by being given his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) own way in every detail.
<p/>All this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as the train whirled him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was <div class="bookquote">``coming alive''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>began to think in a new way and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought long and steadily and deeply.
<p/>'' Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself. '' Ten years is a long time.
<p/>It may be too late to do anything--quite too late. What have I been thinking of! '' Of course this was the wrong Magic--to begin by saying <div class="bookquote">``too late.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>this the Magic</b></font>)</div>Even Colin could have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) that. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) knew nothing of Magic--either black or white. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had yet to learn.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) wondered if Susan Sowerby had taken courage and written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) only because the motherly creature had realized that the boy was much worse--was fatally ill.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not been under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would have been more wretched than ever.
<p/>But the calm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it. Instead of giving way to thoughts of the worst he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) actually found he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was trying to believe in better things.
<p/>'' Could it be possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) sees that I may be able to do him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) good and control him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? ''
<p/>But when on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way across the moor he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stopped the carriage at the cottage, seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in a group and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in the morning to help a woman who had a new baby.
<p/>Our Dickon,'' they volunteered, was over at the Manor working in one of the gardens where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went several days each week.
<p/>Mr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round red-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) awoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) smiled at their friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) pocket and gave it to <div class="bookquote">``our `Lizabeth Ellen''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>who was the oldest.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) thought. '' I will go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) on my way to Misselthwaite. '' '' '' If you divide that into eight parts there will be half a crown for each of, you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said.
<p/>Then amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) drove away, leaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps of joy behind.
<p/>Why did it seem to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) a sense of homecoming which he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had been sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) could never feel again--that sense of the beauty of land and sky and purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing, nearer to the great old house which had held those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) blood for six hundred years?
<p/>How he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had driven away from it the last time, shuddering to think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bed with the brocaded hangings.
<p/>Was it possible that perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might find him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) changed a little for the better and that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shrinking from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?
<p/>The drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing. How real that dream had been--how wonderful and clear the voice which called back to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``In the garden--
<p/>In the garden!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will try to find the key,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. '' I will try to open the door. I must--though I don't know why.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arrived at the Manor the servants who received him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with the usual ceremony noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked better and that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not go to the remote rooms where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) usually lived attended by Pitcher.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went into the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) came to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) somewhat excited and curious and flustered.
<p/>'' How is Master Colin, Medlock? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) inquired. '' Well, sir,'' Mrs. Medlock answered, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s--he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s different, in a manner of speaking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, you see, sir,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) tried to explain, ``neither Dr. Craven, nor the nurse, nor me can exactly make him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Worse?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) suggested. Mrs. Medlock really was flushed. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Why is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>'' To tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) might be changing for the worse.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) appetite, sir, is past understanding--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) ways-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) become more--more peculiar? ''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) master, asked, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) brows anxiously.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) used to eat nothing and then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) began to eat something enormous--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) stopped again all at once and the meals were sent back just as they used to be.
<p/>'' That's it, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>)'s growing very peculiar--when you compare him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) used to be. You never knew, sir, perhaps, that out of doors he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) never would let himself be taken.
<p/>The things we've gone through to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) to go out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) chair would leave a body trembling like a leaf.
<p/>Well, sir, just without warning--not long after one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) worst tantrums he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) suddenly insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and Susan Sowerby's boy Dickon that could push his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took a fancy to both Miss Mary and Dickon, and Dickon brought his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tame animals, and, if you'll credit it, sir, out of doors he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will stay from morning until night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d throw himself into such a state that Dr. Craven said he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) couldn't be responsible for forcing him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>). '' <div class="bookquote">``How does he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) look?
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) food natural, sir, you'd think he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was putting on flesh--but we're afraid it may be a sort of bloat.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the next question. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) laughs sometimes in a queer way when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s alone with Miss Mary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) never used to laugh at all.
<p/>Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once, if you'll allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) never was as puzzled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) life.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Master Colin now? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Craven/Mr. Archibald Craven/Archibald Craven</b></font>)</div>Mr. Craven asked. '' In the garden, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>)'s always in the garden--though not a human creature is allowed to go near for fear they'll look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>).
<p/>In the garden,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) said, and after he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had sent Mrs. Medlock away he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) stood and repeated it again and again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was standing in and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was on earth again he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) turned and went out of the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) way, as Mary had done, through the door in the shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds.
<p/>'' Mr. Craven scarcely heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) last words. '' '' In the garden! '' The fountain was playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn flowers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) crossed the lawn and turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) did not walk quickly, but slowly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) eyes were on the path.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) were being drawn back to the place he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) had so long forsaken, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) did not know why.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) knew where the door was even though the ivy hung thick over it--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) did not know exactly where it lay--that buried key.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) stopped and stood still, looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>), and almost the moment after he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) had paused he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) started and listened--asking himself if he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) were walking in a dream.
<p/>The ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried under the shrubs, no human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years--and yet inside the garden there were sounds.
<p/>They were the sounds of running scuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees, they were strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices--exclamations and smothered joyous cries.
<p/>It seemed actually like the laughter of young things, the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not to be heard but who in a moment or so--as their excitement mounted--would burst forth.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) drew near to it his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) step became still more slow. What in heaven's name was he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) dreaming of--what in heaven's name did he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hear?
<p/>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) losing his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) reason and thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) heard things which were not for human ears? Was it that the far clear voice had meant?
<p/>The feet ran faster and faster--they were nearing the garden door--there was quick strong young breathing and a wild outbreak of laughing shows which could not be contained--and the door in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back, and a boy burst through it at full speed and, without seeing the outsider, dashed almost into his (<font color='blue'><b>outsider</b></font>) arms.
<p/>Mr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) from falling as a result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) unseeing dash against him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>), and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) away to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) in amazement at his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) being there he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) truly gasped for breath.
<p/>And then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the sounds forgot to hush themselves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was a tall boy and a handsome one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) threw the thick hair back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray eyes--eyes full of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) was glowing with life and his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) running had sent splendid color leaping to his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) face. It was the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.
<p/>'' Who--What? Who!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) stammered. This was not what Colin had expected--this was not what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had planned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had never thought of such a meeting.
<p/>Mary, who had been running with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) and had dashed through the door too, believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) managed to make himself look taller than he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had ever looked before--inches taller.
<p/>And yet to come dashing out--winning a race--perhaps it was even better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) drew himself up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) very tallest. ''
<p/>Father,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm Colin. You can't believe it. I scarcely can myself. I'm Colin. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Like Mrs. Medlock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) did not understand what his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) father meant when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said hurriedly:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the garden! In the garden! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div>hurried on Colin. '' It was the garden that did it--and Mary and Dickon and the creatures--and the Magic.
<p/>No one knows. We kept it to tell you when you came. I'm well , I can beat Mary in a race.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) said it all so like a healthy boy--his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) face flushed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) words tumbling over each other in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) eagerness--that Mr. Craven's soul shook with unbelieving joy.
<p/>I'm going to be an athlete. '' Colin put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) hand and laid it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) father's arm. '' Aren't you glad, Father?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) ended.
<p/>'' Aren't you glad? I'm going to live forever and ever and ever! '' Mr. Craven put his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) hands on both the boy's shoulders and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) still.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) dared not even try to speak for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Take me into the garden, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said at last.
<p/>The place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue and flaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies standing together--lilies which were white or white and ruby.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) remembered well when the first of them had been planted that just at this season of the year their late glories should reveal themselves.
<p/>Late roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine deepening the hue of the yellowing trees made one feel that one, stood in an embowered temple of gold.
<p/>'' And tell me all about it. '' And so they led him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in. The newcomer stood silent just as the children had done when they came into its grayness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) looked round and round. '' I thought it would be dead,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) said. '' Mary thought so at first,'' said Colin.
<p/>'' But it came alive. '' Then they sat down under their tree--all but Colin, who wanted to stand while he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) told the story.
<p/>It was the strangest thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) had ever heard, Archibald Craven thought, as it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion.
<p/>Mystery and Magic and wild creatures, the weird midnight meeting--the coming of the spring--the passion of insulted pride which had dragged the young Rajah to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) feet to defy old Ben Weatherstaff to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) face.
<p/>The listener laughed until tears came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) eyes and sometimes tears came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) eyes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rajah</b></font>) was not laughing.
<p/>The odd companionship, the play acting, the great secret so carefully kept. The Athlete, the Lecturer, the Scientific Discoverer was a laughable, lovable, healthy young human thing.
<p/>I dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they see me--but I am never going to get into the chair again.
<p/>'' Now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Athlete</b></font>) said at the end of the story, <div class="bookquote">``it need not be a secret any more. I shall walk back with you, Father--to the house.
<p/>Ben Weatherstaff's duties rarely took him (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) away from the gardens, but on this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) made an excuse to carry some vegetables to the kitchen and being invited into the servants' hall by Mrs. Medlock to drink a glass of beer
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) was on the spot--as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) had hoped to be--when the most dramatic event Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the present generation actually took place.
<p/>Mrs. Medlock, knowing Ben had come from the gardens, hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) might have caught sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) master and even by chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) meeting with Master Colin.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>One of the windows looking upon the courtyard gave also a glimpse of the lawn. '' Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) asked. Ben took his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) beer-mug from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) mouth and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) lips with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) hand. ''
<p/>Aye, that I did,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) answered with a shrewdly significant air. '' Both of them?'' suggested Mrs. Medlock. '' Both of 'em,'' returned Ben Weatherstaff.
<p/>'' Thank ye kindly, ma'am, I could sup up another mug of it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Together?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Medlock/Medlock</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his (<font color='blue'><b>Weatherstaff</b></font>) beer-mug in her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) excitement.
<p/>'' Together, ma'am,'' and Ben gulped down half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) new mug at one gulp. '' Where was Master Colin? How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) look?
<p/>What did they say to each other?'' <div class="bookquote">``I didna' hear that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>said Ben, <div class="bookquote">``along o' only bein' on th' stepladder lookin, over th' wall.
<p/>But I'll tell thee this. There's been things goin' on outside as you house people knows nowt about. An' what tha'll find out tha'll find out soon.
<p/>And it was not two minutes before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) swallowed the last of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) beer and waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) mug solemnly toward the window which took in through the shrubbery a piece of the lawn.
<p/>When Mrs. Medlock looked she (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) threw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Medlock</b></font>) hands and gave a little shriek and every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across the servants' hall and stood looking through the window with their eyes almost starting out of their heads.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Weatherstaff/Ben/Weatherstaff</b></font>)</div>'' Look there,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if tha's curious. Look what's comin' across th' grass. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Across the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) looked as many of them had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>).
<p/>And by his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>), side with his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) head up in the air and his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) eyes full of laughter walked as strongly and steadily as any boy in Yorkshire--Master Colin.
