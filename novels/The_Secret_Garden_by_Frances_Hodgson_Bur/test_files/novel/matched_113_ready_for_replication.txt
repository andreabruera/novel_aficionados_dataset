when $mary_lennox$ was sent to misselthwaite manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable looking child ever seen
xxvii in the #garden# the secret #garden# by frances hodgson burnett #chapter# i there is no #one# left it was true too
her hair was yellow and her face was yellow because she had been born in india and had always been ill in #one# way or another
her father had held a position under the english government and had always been busy and ill himself and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people
she had not wanted a little girl at all and when $mary_lennox$ was born she handed her over to the care of an ayah who was made to understand that if she wished to please the mem sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible
so when she was a sickly fretful ugly little #baby# she was kept out of the way and when she became a sickly fretful toddling #thing# she was kept out of the way also
she never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her ayah and the other native servants and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything because the mem sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her #crying# by the time she was six years old
she had a little thin face and a little thin body thin light hair and a sour #expression# she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived
the young english governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months and when other governesses came to try to fill it
so if $mary_lennox$ had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all
#one# frightfully hot morning when she was about nine years old she awakened feeling very cross and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her ayah
they always went away in a shorter time than the first #one# why did you come she said to the strange woman
the woman looked frightened but she only stammered that the ayah could not come and when $mary_lennox$ threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the ayah to come to missie sahib
i will not let you stay send my ayah to me there was something mysterious in the air that morning
nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing while those whom $mary_lennox$ saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces
she was actually left alone as the morning went on and at last she wandered out into the #garden# and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda
she pretended that she was making a flower bed and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the #thing# she would say and the names she would call saidie when she returned
but no #one# would tell her anything and her ayah did not come pig pig daughter of pigs she said because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all
she was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with some #one#
she was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices $mary_lennox$ knew the fair young man who looked like a boy
she had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from england the child stared at him but she stared most at her mother
she always did this when she had a chance to see her because the mem sahib $mary_lennox$ used to call her that oftener than anything else was such a tall slim pretty person and wore such lovely clothes
her hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining #thing# and she had large laughing #eye#
all her clothes were thin and floating and $mary_lennox$ said they were full of lace they looked fuller of lace than ever this morning but her #eye# were not laughing at all
they were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer face is it so very bad oh is it
$mary_lennox$ heard her say awfully the young man answered in a trembling voice awfully mrs $mary_lennox$ you ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago
the mem sahib wrung her hands oh i know i ought she cried i only stayed to go to that silly dinner party
at that very moment such a loud #sound# of wailing broke out from the servants quarters that she clutched the young man arm and $mary_lennox$ stood shivering from head to foot
what a fool i was the wailing grew wilder and wilder what is it what is it mrs $mary_lennox$ gasped
some #one# has died answered the boy officer you did not say it had broken out among your servants
i did not know the mem sahib cried come with me come with me and she turned and ran into the house
after that appalling #thing# happened and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to $mary_lennox$ the cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies
the ayah had been taken ill in the night and it was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts
before the next #day# three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror there was panic on every side and dying people in all the bungalows
during the confusion and bewilderment of the second #day# $mary_lennox$ hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone nobody thought of her nobody wanted her and strange #thing# happened of which she knew nothing
$mary_lennox$ alternately cried and slept through the hours she only knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening #sound#
once she crept into the dining room and found it empty though a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason
the child ate some fruit and biscuits and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled it was sweet and she did not know how strong it was
very soon it made her intensely drowsy and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying #sound# of feet
the wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her #eye# open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time
many #thing# happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily but she was not disturbed by the wails and the #sound# of #thing# being carried in and out of the bungalow
when she awakened she lay and stared at the wall the house was perfectly still she had never known it to be so silent before
she heard neither voices nor footsteps and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over
she wondered also who would take care of her now her ayah was dead there would be a new ayah and perhaps she would know some new stories
$mary_lennox$ had been rather tired of the old #one# she did not cry because her nurse had died she was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for any #one#
the noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her and she had been angry because no #one# seemed to remember that she was alive
everyone was too panic stricken to think of a little girl no #one# was fond of when people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves
but if everyone had got well again surely some #one# would remember and come to look for her but no #one# came and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent
she heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with #eye# like jewels
she was not frightened because he was a harmless little #thing# who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room
he slipped under the door as she watched him how queer and quiet it is she said it #sound# as if there were no #one# in the bungalow but me and the snake
almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound and then on the veranda they were men footsteps and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices
no #one# went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms what desolation
she heard #one# voice say that pretty pretty woman i suppose the child too i heard there was a child though no #one# ever saw her
she looked an ugly cross little #thing# and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected
$mary_lennox$ was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later the first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father
he looked tired and troubled but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back barney he cried out
there is a child here a child alone in a place like this mercy on us who is she i am $mary_lennox$ the little girl said drawing herself up stiffly
she thought the man was very rude to call her father bungalow a place like this i fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and i have only just wakened up
why does nobody come it is the child no #one# ever saw exclaimed the man turning to his companions
she has actually been forgotten why was i forgotten $mary_lennox$ said stamping her foot why does nobody come
the young man whose name was barney looked at her very sadly $mary_lennox$ even thought she saw him wink his #eye# as if to wink tears away
it was in that strange and sudden way that $mary_lennox$ found out that she had neither father nor mother left that they had died and been carried away in the night and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it none of them even remembering that there was a missie sahib
poor little kid he said there is nobody left to come that was why the place was so quiet
#chapter# ii mistress $mary_lennox$ quite contrary $mary_lennox$ had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had thought her very pretty
but as she knew very little of her she could scarcely have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when she was gone
she did not miss her at all in fact and as she was a self absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself as she had always done
if she had been older she would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the #world# but she was very young and as she had always been taken care of she supposed she always would be
what she thought was that she would like to know if she was going to nice people who would be polite to her and give her her own way as her ayah and the other native servants had done
it was true that there was no #one# in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake she knew that she was not going to stay at the english clergyman house where she was taken at first
she did not want to stay the english clergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same age
$mary_lennox$ hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the first #day# or two nobody would play with her
and they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toys from each other by the second #day# they had given her a nickname which made her furious
it was basil who thought of it first basil was a little boy with impudent blue #eye# and a turned up nose and $mary_lennox$ hated him
she was playing by herself under a tree just as she had been playing the #day# the cholera broke out she was making heaps of earth and paths for a #garden# and basil came and stood near to watch her
presently he got rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion why dont you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery
he said there in the middle and he leaned over her to point go away cried $mary_lennox$ i dont want boys
go away for a moment basil looked angry and then he began to tease he was always teasing his #sister#
he danced round and round her and made faces and sang and laughed mistress $mary_lennox$ quite contrary how does your #garden# grow
he sang it until the other children heard and laughed too and the crosser $mary_lennox$ got the more they sang mistress $mary_lennox$ quite contrary and after that as long as she stayed with them they called her mistress $mary_lennox$ quite contrary when they spoke of her to each other and often when they spoke to her
with silver bells and cockle shells and marigolds all in a row you are going to be sent home basil said to her at the end of the week
and we re glad of it i am glad of it too answered $mary_lennox$ where is home she doesnt know where home is said basil with seven year old scorn
it england of #course# our grandmama lives there and our #sister# mabel was sent to her last year you are not going to your grandmama
you have none you are going to your uncle his name is $mr_archibald_craven$ i dont know anything about him snapped $mary_lennox$
i know you dont basil answered you dont know anything girls never do i heard father and mother talking about him
he lives in a great big desolate old house in the country and no #one# goes near him he so cross he wont let them and they wouldnt come if he would let them
i dont believe you said $mary_lennox$ and she turned her back and stuck her fingers in her ears because she would not listen any more
but she thought over it a great deal afterward and when mrs crawford told her that night that she was going to sail away to england in a few #day# and go to her uncle $mr_archibald_craven$ who lived at misselthwaite manor she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested that they did not know what to think about her
they tried to be kind to her but she only turned her face away when mrs crawford attempted to kiss her and held herself stiffly when mr crawford patted her shoulder
he a hunchback and he horrid she is such a plain child mrs crawford said pityingly afterward and her mother was such a pretty creature
she had a very pretty manner too and $mary_lennox$ has the most unattractive ways i ever saw in a child the children call her mistress $mary_lennox$ quite contrary and though it naughty of them #one# cant help understanding it
perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty manners oftener into the nursery $mary_lennox$ might have learned some pretty ways too
it is very sad now the poor beautiful #thing# is gone to remember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all
i believe she scarcely ever looked at her sighed mrs crawford when her ayah was dead there was no #one# to give a thought to the little #thing#
colonel mcgrew said he nearly jumped out of his skin when he opened the door and found her standing by herself in the middle of the room
$mary_lennox$ made the long voyage to england under the care of an officer wife who was taking her children to leave them in a boarding school
she was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl and was rather glad to hand the child over to the woman
think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone in that deserted bungalow $mr_archibald_craven$ sent to meet her in london
the woman was his housekeeper at misselthwaite manor and her name was $mrs_medlock$ she was a stout woman with very red cheeks and sharp black #eye#
she wore a very purple dress a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved her head
$mary_lennox$ did not like her at all but as she very seldom liked people there was nothing remarkable in that besides which it was very evident $mrs_medlock$ did not think much of her
my word she a plain little piece of goods she said and we heard that her mother was a beauty
she hasnt handed much of it down has she ma am perhaps she will improve as she grows older the officer wife said good naturedly
if she were not so sallow and had a nicer #expression# her features are rather good children alter so much
she ll have to alter a good deal answered $mrs_medlock$ and there nothing likely to improve children at misselthwaite if you ask me
they thought $mary_lennox$ was not listening because she was standing a little apart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to
she was watching the passing buses and cabs and people but she heard quite well and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he lived in
what sort of a place was it and what would he be like what was a hunchback she had never seen #one#
since she had been living in other people houses and had had no ayah she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new to her
she had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to anyone even when her father and mother had been alive
other children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers but she had never seemed to really be anyone little girl
perhaps there were none in india she had had servants and food and clothes but no #one# had taken any notice of her
she did not know that this was because she was a disagreeable child but then of #course# she did not know she was disagreeable
she thought $mrs_medlock$ the most disagreeable person she had ever seen with her common highly colored face and her common fine bonnet
when the next #day# they set out on their journey to $yorkshire$ she walked through the station to the railway #carriage# with her head up and trying to keep as far away from her as she could because she did not want to seem to belong to her
she often thought that other people were but she did not know that she was so herself it would have made her angry to think people imagined she was her little girl
but $mrs_medlock$ was not in the least disturbed by her and her thoughts she was the kind of woman who would stand no nonsense from young #one#
she had not wanted to go to london just when her #sister# maria daughter was going to be married but she had a comfortable well paid place as housekeeper at misselthwaite manor and the only way in which she could keep it was to do at once what $mr_archibald_craven$ told her to do
at least that is what she would have said if she had been asked she never dared even to ask a question
captain $mary_lennox$ and his wife died of the cholera $mr_archibald_craven$ had said in his short cold way captain $mary_lennox$ was my wife brother and i am their daughter guardian
the child is to be brought here you must go to london and bring her yourself so she packed her small trunk and made the journey
she had nothing to read or to look at and she had folded her thin little black gloved hands in her lap
her black dress made her look yellower than ever and her limp light hair straggled from under her black crepe hat
$mary_lennox$ sat in her corner of the railway #carriage# and looked plain and fretful a more marred looking young #one# i never saw in my life $mrs_medlock$ thought
she had never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything and at last she got tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk hard voice
marred is a $yorkshire$ word and means spoiled and pettish i suppose i may as well tell you something about where you are going to she said
do you know anything about your uncle no said $mary_lennox$ never heard your father and mother talk about him
no said $mary_lennox$ frowning she frowned because she remembered that her father and mother had never talked to her about anything in particular
certainly they had never told her #thing# humph muttered $mrs_medlock$ staring at her queer unresponsive little face she did not say any more for a few moments
and then she began again i suppose you might as well be told something to prepare you you are going to a queer place
$mary_lennox$ said nothing at all and $mrs_medlock$ looked rather discomfited by her apparent indifference but after taking a breath she went on
not but that it a grand big place in a gloomy way and $mr_archibald_craven$ proud of it in his way and that gloomy enough too
the house is six hundred years old and it on the edge of the moor and there near a hundred rooms in it though most of them shut up and locked
and there pictures and fine old furniture and #thing# that been there for ages and there a big park round it and #garden# and trees with branches trailing to the ground some of them
she paused and took another breath but there nothing else she ended suddenly $mary_lennox$ had begun to listen in spite of herself
it all sounded so unlike india and anything new rather attracted her but she did not intend to look as if she were interested
that was #one# of her unhappy disagreeable ways so she sat still well said $mrs_medlock$ what do you think of it
nothing she answered i know nothing about such places that made $mrs_medlock$ laugh a short sort of laugh
eh she said but you are like an old woman dont you care it doesnt matter said $mary_lennox$ whether i care or not
you are right enough there said $mrs_medlock$ it doesnt what you re to be kept at misselthwaite manor for i dont know unless because it the easiest way
he not going to trouble himself about you that sure and certain he never troubles himself about no #one# she stopped herself as if she had just remembered something in time
he was a sour young man and got no good of all his money and big place till he was married
he got a crooked back she said that set him wrong $mary_lennox$ #eye# turned toward her in spite of her intention not to seem to care
she had never thought of the hunchback being married and she was a trifle surprised $mrs_medlock$ saw this and as she was a talkative woman she continued with more interest
this was #one# way of passing some of the time at any rate she was a sweet pretty #thing# and he have walked the #world# over to get her a blade grass she wanted
nobody thought she marry him but she did and people said she married him for his money but she didnt she didnt positively
when she died $mary_lennox$ gave a little involuntary jump oh did she die she exclaimed quite without meaning to
it had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess and it had made her suddenly sorry for $mr_archibald_craven$
she had just remembered a french fairy story she had once read called riquet a la houppe yes she died $mrs_medlock$ answered
most of the time he goes away and when he is at misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the west wing and wont let any #one# but
and it made him queerer than ever he cares about nobody he wont see people pitcher see him pitcher an old fellow but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his ways
a house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up and with their doors locked a house on the edge of a moor whatsoever a moor was sounded dreary
it sounded like something in a book and it did not make $mary_lennox$ feel cheerful a man with a crooked back who shut himself up also
she stared out of the window with her lips pinched together and it seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in gray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window panes
if the pretty wife had been alive she might have made #thing# cheerful by being something like her own mother and by running in and out and going to parties as she had done in frocks full of lace
but she was not there any more you neednt expect to see him because ten to #one# you wont said $mrs_medlock$
and you mustnt expect that there will be people to talk to you you ll have to play about and look after yourself
you ll be told what rooms you can go into and what rooms you re to keep out of there #garden# enough but when you re in the house dont go wandering and poking about
i shall not want to go poking about said sour little $mary_lennox$ and just as suddenly as she had begun to be rather sorry for $mr_archibald_craven$ she began to cease to be sorry and to think he was unpleasant enough to deserve all that had happened to him
and she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of the railway #carriage# and gazed out at the gray rain storm which looked as if it would go on forever and ever
she watched it so long and steadily that the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her #eye# and she fell asleep
she slept a long time and when she awakened $mrs_medlock$ had bought a lunchbasket at #one# of the stations and they had some chicken and cold beef and bread and butter and some hot tea
the rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening waterproofs
the guard lighted the lamps in the #carriage# and $mrs_medlock$ cheered up very much over her tea and chicken and beef
she ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself and $mary_lennox$ sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet slip on #one# side until she herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the #carriage# lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows
$mr_archibald_craven$ wont have it #chapter# iii across the moor it was quite dark when she awakened again the train had stopped at a station and $mrs_medlock$ was shaking her
you have had a sleep she said it time to open your #eye# we re at thwaite station and we ve got a long drive before us
the little girl did not offer to help her because in india native servants always picked up or carried #thing# and it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on #one#
$mary_lennox$ stood up and tried to keep her #eye# open while $mrs_medlock$ collected her parcels the station was a small #one# and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out of the train
the station master spoke to $mrs_medlock$ in a rough good natured way pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion which $mary_lennox$ found out afterward was $yorkshire$
aye that her answered $mrs_medlock$ speaking with a $yorkshire$ accent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward $mary_lennox$
i see #tha# got back he said an #tha# browt th young un with thee how thy missus
well enow th #carriage# is waitin outside for thee a brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform
his long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was the burly station master included
when he shut the door mounted the box with the coachman and they drove off the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned corner but she was not inclined to go to sleep again
she sat and looked out of the window curious to see something of the road over which she was being driven to the queer place $mrs_medlock$ had spoken of
she was not at all a timid child and she was not exactly frightened but she felt that there was no knowing what might happen in a house with a hundred rooms nearly all
$mary_lennox$ saw that it was a smart #carriage# and that it was a smart footman who helped her in shut up a house standing on the edge of a moor
what is a moor she said suddenly to $mrs_medlock$ look out of the window in about ten minutes and you ll see the woman answered
we ve got to drive five miles across missel moor before we get to the manor you wont see much because it a dark night but you can see something
the #carriage# lamps cast rays of light a little distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the #thing# they passed
after they had left the station they had driven through a tiny village and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public house
then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little shop window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd #thing# set out for sale
$mary_lennox$ asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner keeping her #eye# on the window then they were on the highroad
and she saw hedges and trees after that there seemed nothing different for a long time or at least it seemed a long time to her
at last the horses began to go more slowly as if they were climbing up hill and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees
she could see nothing in fact but a dense darkness on either side she leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just as the #carriage# gave a big jolt
the #carriage# lamps shed a yellow light on a rough looking road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low growing #thing# which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them
eh we re on the moor now sure enough said $mrs_medlock$ a wind was rising and making a singular wild low rushing #sound#
it it not the sea is it said $mary_lennox$ looking round at her companion no not it answered $mrs_medlock$
nor it isnt fields nor mountains it just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep
i feel as if it might be the sea if there were water on it said $mary_lennox$ it #sound# like the sea just now
that the wind blowing through the bushes $mrs_medlock$ said it a wild dreary enough place to my mind though there plenty that likes it particularly when the heather in bloom
on and on they drove through the darkness and though the rain stopped the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange #sound#
the road went up and down and several times the #carriage# passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise
$mary_lennox$ felt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land
i dont like it she said to herself i dont like it and she pinched her thin lips more tightly together
the horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught sight of a light $mrs_medlock$ saw it as soon as she did and drew a long sigh of relief
eh i am glad to see that bit light twinkling she exclaimed it the light in the lodge window
it was after a bit as she said for when the #carriage# passed through the park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and
we shall get a good cup of tea after a bit at all events the trees which nearly met overhead made it seem as if they were driving through a long dark vault
they drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an immensely long but low built house which seemed to ramble round a stone court
at first $mary_lennox$ thought that there were no lights at all in the windows but as she got out of the #carriage# she saw that #one# room in a corner upstairs showed a dull glow
the entrance door was a huge #one# made of massive curiously shaped panels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron bars
it opened into an enormous hall which was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of armor made $mary_lennox$ feel that she did not want to look at them
as she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small odd little black figure and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked
a neat thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for them you are to take her to her room he said in a husky voice
he doesnt want to see her he going to london in the morning very well mr pitcher $mrs_medlock$ answered
what expected of you $mrs_medlock$ mr pitcher said is that you make sure that he not disturbed and that he doesnt see what he doesnt want to see
and then $mary_lennox$ was led up a broad staircase and down a long corridor and up a short flight of steps and through another corridor and another until a door opened in a wall
so long as i know what expected of me i can manage and she found herself in a room with a fire in it and a supper on a table
$mrs_medlock$ said unceremoniously well here you are this room and the next are where you ll live and you must keep to them
it was in this way mistress $mary_lennox$ arrived at misselthwaite manor and she had perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life
when she opened her #eye# in the morning it was because a young housemaid had come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling on the hearth rug raking out the cinders noisily
dont you forget that #chapter# iv $martha$ $mary_lennox$ lay and watched her for a few moments and then began to look about the room
she had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy the walls were covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it
there were fantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle
out of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it and to look rather like an endless dull purplish sea
there were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies $mary_lennox$ felt as if she were in the forest with them
what is that she said pointing out of the window $martha$ the young housemaid who had just risen to her feet looked and pointed also
that there she said yes that th moor with a good natured grin does #tha# like it
no answered $mary_lennox$ i hate it that because #tha# rt not used to it $martha$ said going back to her hearth
#tha# thinks it too big an bare now but #tha# will like it do you inquired $mary_lennox$ aye that i do answered $martha$ cheerfully polishing away at the grate
i just love it it none bare it covered wi growin #thing# as smells sweet it fair lovely in spring an summer when th gorse an broom an heather in flower
it smells honey an there such a lot fresh air an th sky looks so high an th bees an skylarks makes such a nice noise hummin an singin
eh i wouldnt live away from th moor for anythin $mary_lennox$ listened to her with a grave puzzled #expression# the native servants she had been used to in india were not in the least like this
they were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their masters as if they were their equals they made salaams and called them protector of the poor and names of that sort
it was not the custom to say please and thank you and $mary_lennox$ had always slapped her ayah in the face when she was angry
indian servants were commanded to do #thing# not asked she wondered a little what this girl would do if #one# slapped her in the face
she was a round rosy good natured looking creature but she had a sturdy way which made mistress $mary_lennox$ wonder if she might not even slap back if the person who slapped her was only a little girl
$martha$ sat up on her heels with her blacking brush in her hand and laughed without seeming the least out of temper
you are a strange servant she said from her pillows rather haughtily eh i know that she said
if there was a grand missus at misselthwaite i should never have been even #one# of th under house maids i might have been let to be scullerymaid
but i never have been let upstairs i too common an i talk too much $yorkshire$ but this is a funny house for all
it so grand seems like there neither master nor mistress except mr pitcher an $mrs_medlock$ $mr_archibald_craven$ he wont be troubled about anythin when he here an he nearly always away
$mrs_medlock$ gave me th place out kindness she told me she could never have done it if misselthwaite had been like other big houses
are you going to be my servant $mary_lennox$ asked still in her imperious little indian way $martha$ began to rub her grate again
i $mrs_medlock$ servant she said stoutly an she $mr_archibald_craven$ but i to do the housemaid work up here
an wait on you a bit but you wont need much waitin on who is going to dress me demanded $mary_lennox$
$martha$ sat up on her heels again and stared she spoke in broad $yorkshire$ in her amazement canna #tha# dress thysen
she said what do you mean i dont understand your language said $mary_lennox$ eh i forgot $martha$ said
$mrs_medlock$ told me i have to be careful or you wouldnt know what i was sayin i mean cant you put on your own clothes
no answered $mary_lennox$ quite indignantly i never did in my life my ayah dressed me of #course# well said $martha$ evidently not in the least aware that she was impudent it time #tha# should learn
my mother always said she couldnt see why grand people children didnt turn out fair fools what with nurses an bein washed an dressed an took out to walk as if they was puppies
#tha# cannot begin younger it ll do thee good to wait on thysen a bit it is different in india said mistress $mary_lennox$ disdainfully
she could scarcely stand this but $martha$ was not at all crushed eh i can see it different she answered almost sympathetically
i dare say it because there such a lot blacks there instead respectable white people when i heard you was comin from india
i thought you was a black too $mary_lennox$ sat up in bed furious what she said what you thought i was a native
you you daughter of a pig $martha$ stared and looked hot who are you callin names she said you neednt be so vexed
that not th way for a young lady to talk i ve nothin against th blacks when you read about em in tracts they re always very religious
you always read as a black a man an a brother i ve never seen a black an i was fair pleased to think i was goin to see #one# close
when i come in to light your fire this mornin i crep up to your bed an pulled th cover back careful to look at you
an there you was disappointedly no more black than me for all you re so yeller $mary_lennox$ did not even try to control her rage and humiliation
you thought i was a native you dared you dont know anything about natives they are not people they re servants who must salaam to you
she was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl simple stare and somehow she suddenly felt so horribly lonely and far away from everything she understood and which understood her that she threw herself face downward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing
you know nothing about india you know nothing about anything she sobbed so unrestrainedly that good natured $yorkshire$ $martha$ was a little frightened and quite sorry for her
she went to the bed and bent over her eh you mustnt cry like that there she begged
you mustnt for sure i didnt know you be vexed i dont know anythin about anythin just like you said i beg your pardon
there was something comforting and really friendly in her queer $yorkshire$ speech and sturdy way which had a good effect on $mary_lennox$
miss do stop cryin she gradually ceased #crying# and became quiet $martha$ looked relieved it time for thee to get up now she said
$mrs_medlock$ said i was to carry #tha# breakfast an tea an dinner into th room next to this it been made into a nursery for thee
i ll help thee on with thy clothes if #tha# ll get out bed if th buttons are at th back #tha# cannot button them up #tha# self
when $mary_lennox$ at last decided to get up the clothes $martha$ took from the wardrobe were not the #one# she had worn when she arrived the night before with $mrs_medlock$
those are not mine she said mine are black she looked the thick white wool coat and dress over and added with cool approval those are nicer than mine
these are th #one# #tha# must put on $martha$ answered $mr_archibald_craven$ ordered $mrs_medlock$ to get em in london
he said i wont have a child dressed in black wanderin about like a lost soul he said it make the place sadder than it is
put #color# on her mother she said she knew what he meant mother always knows what a body means she doesnt hold with black hersel
$martha$ had buttoned up her little #sister# and brothers but she had never seen a child who stood still and waited for another person to do #thing# for her as if she had neither hands nor feet of her own
i hate black #thing# said $mary_lennox$ the dressing process was #one# which taught them both something why doesnt #tha# put on #tha# own shoes
she said when $mary_lennox$ quietly held out her foot my ayah did it answered $mary_lennox$ staring it was the custom
if #one# told them to do a #thing# their ancestors had not done for a thousand years they gazed at #one# mildly and said it is not the custom and #one# knew that was the end of the matter
it had not been the custom that mistress $mary_lennox$ should do anything but stand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll but before she was ready for breakfast she began to suspect that her life at misselthwaite manor would end by teaching her a number of #thing# quite new to her #thing# such as putting on her own shoes and stockings and picking up #thing# she let fall
if $martha$ had been a well trained fine young lady maid she would have been more subservient and respectful and would have known that it was her business to brush hair and button boots and pick #thing# up and lay them away
she was however only an untrained $yorkshire$ rustic who had been brought up in a moorland cottage with a swarm of little brothers and #sister# who had never dreamed of doing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger #one# who were either #baby# in arms or just learning to totter about and tumble over #thing#
if $mary_lennox$ had been a child who was ready to be amused she would perhaps have laughed at $martha$ readiness to talk but $mary_lennox$ only listened to her coldly and wondered at her freedom of manner
at first she was not at all interested but gradually as the girl rattled on in her good tempered homely way $mary_lennox$ began to notice what she was saying
she said that very often it was the custom the native servants were always saying it eh you should see em all she said
there twelve of us an my father only gets sixteen shilling a week i can tell you my mother put to it to get porridge for em all
they tumble about on th moor an play there all #day# an mother says th air of th moor fattens em
she says she believes they eat th grass same as th wild ponies do our $dickon$ he twelve years old and he got a young pony he calls his own
he found it on th moor with its mother when it was a little #one# an he began to make friends with it an give it bits bread an pluck young grass for it
where did he get it asked $mary_lennox$ and it got to like him so it follows him about an
it lets him get on its back $dickon$ a kind lad an animals likes him $mary_lennox$ had never possessed an animal pet of her own and had always thought she should like #one#
so she began to feel a slight interest in $dickon$ and as she had never before been interested in any #one# but herself it was the dawning of a healthy sentiment
when she went into the room which had been made into a nursery for her she found that it was rather like the #one# she had slept in
it was not a child room but a grown up person room with gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old oak chairs
but she had always had a very small appetite and she looked with something more than indifference at the first plate $martha$ set before her
a table in the center was set with a good substantial breakfast i dont want it she said #tha# doesnt want thy porridge
$martha$ exclaimed incredulously no #tha# doesnt know how good it is put a bit treacle on it or a bit sugar
i dont want it repeated $mary_lennox$ eh said $martha$ i cant abide to see good victuals go to waste
if our children was at this table they clean it bare in five minutes why said $mary_lennox$ coldly why echoed $martha$
because they scarce ever had their stomachs full in their lives they re as hungry as young hawks an foxes
i dont know what it is to be hungry said $mary_lennox$ with the indifference of ignorance $martha$ looked indignant well it would do thee good to try it
i can see that plain enough she said outspokenly i ve no patience with folk as sits an just stares at good bread an meat
my word dont i wish $dickon$ and phil an jane an th rest of em had what here under their pinafores
why dont you take it to them suggested $mary_lennox$ it not mine answered $martha$ stoutly an this isnt my #day# out
i get my #day# out once a month same as th rest then i go home an clean up for mother an give her a #day# rest
$mary_lennox$ drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade you wrap up warm an run out an play you said $martha$
it ll do you good and give you some stomach for your meat $mary_lennox$ went to the window there were #garden# and paths and big trees but everything looked dull and wintry
out why should i go out on a #day# like this well if #tha# doesnt go out #tha# lt have to stay in an what has #tha# got to do
$mary_lennox$ glanced about her there was nothing to do when $mrs_medlock$ had prepared the nursery she had not thought of amusement
perhaps it would be better to go and see what the #garden# were like who will go with me she inquired
$martha$ stared you ll go by yourself she answered you ll have to learn to play like other children does when they havent got #sister# and brothers
our $dickon$ goes off on th moor by himself an plays for hours that how he made friends with th pony
he got sheep on th moor that knows him an birds as comes an eats out of his hand however little there is to eat he always saves a bit his bread to coax his pets
it was really this mention of $dickon$ which made $mary_lennox$ decide to go out though she was not aware of it
there would be birds outside though there would not be ponies or sheep they would be different from the birds in india and it might amuse her to look at them
$martha$ found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout little boots and she showed her her way downstairs
if #tha# goes round that way #tha# ll come to th #garden# she said pointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery
there lots flowers in summer time but there nothin bloomin now she seemed to hesitate a second before she added #one# of th #garden# is locked up
no #one# has been in it for ten years why asked $mary_lennox$ in spite of herself here was another locked door added to the hundred in the strange house
$mr_archibald_craven$ had it shut when his wife died so sudden he wont let no #one# go inside it was her #garden#
he locked th door an dug a hole and buried th key there $mrs_medlock$ bell ringing i must run after she was gone $mary_lennox$ turned down the walk which led to the door in the shrubbery
she could not help thinking about the #garden# which no #one# had been into for ten years she wondered what it would look like and whether there were any flowers still alive in it
when she had passed through the shrubbery gate she found herself in great #garden# with wide lawns and winding walks with clipped borders
there were trees and flower beds and evergreens clipped into strange shapes and a large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst
but the flower beds were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing this was not the #garden# which was shut up
she was just thinking this when she saw that at the end of the path she was following there seemed to be a long wall with ivy growing over it
she was not familiar enough with england to know that she was coming upon the kitchen #garden# where the vegetables and fruit were growing
she went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in the ivy and that it stood open
how could a #garden# be shut up you could always walk into a #garden# this was not the closed #garden# evidently and she could go into it
she went through the door and found that it was a #garden# with walls all round it and that it was only #one# of several walled #garden# which seemed to open into #one# another
she saw another open green door revealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables fruit trees were trained flat against the wall and over some of the beds there were glass frames
the place was bare and ugly enough $mary_lennox$ thought as she stood and stared about her it might be nicer in summer when #thing# were green but there was nothing pretty about it now
presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through the door leading from the second #garden# he looked startled when he saw $mary_lennox$ and then touched his cap
he had a surly old face and did not seem at all pleased to see her but then she was displeased with his #garden# and wore her quite contrary #expression# and certainly did not seem at all pleased to see him
what is this place she asked #one# th kitchen #garden# he answered what is that said $mary_lennox$ pointing through the other green door
another of em shortly there another ont other side th wall an there th orchardt other side that
can i go in them asked $mary_lennox$ if #tha# likes but there nowt to see $mary_lennox$ made no response
there she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass frames but in the second wall there was another green door and it was not open
she went down the path and through the second green door perhaps it led into the #garden# which no #one# had seen for ten years
as she was not at all a timid child and always did what she wanted to do $mary_lennox$ went to the green door and turned the handle
she hoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she had found the mysterious #garden# but it did open quite easily and she walked through it and found herself in an orchard
all round it also and trees trained against them and there were bare fruit trees growing in the winter browned grass but there was no green door to be seen anywhere
$mary_lennox$ looked for it and yet when she had entered the upper end of the #garden# she had noticed that the wall did not seem to end with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place at the other side
she could see the tops of trees above the wall and when she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on the topmost branch of #one# of them and suddenly he burst into his winter song almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling to her
she stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful friendly little whistle gave her a pleased feeling even a disagreeable little girl may be lonely and the big closed house and big bare moor and big bare #garden# had made this #one# feel as if there was no #one# left in the #world# but herself
if she had been an affectionate child who had been used to being loved she would have broken her heart but even though she was mistress $mary_lennox$ quite contrary she was desolate and the bright breasted little bird brought a look into her sour little face which was almost a smile
there were walls she listened to him until he flew away he was not like an indian bird and she liked him and wondered if she should ever see him again
perhaps he lived in the mysterious #garden# and knew all about it perhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that
she thought so much of the deserted #garden# she was curious about it and wanted to see what it was like
why had $mr_archibald_craven$ buried the key if he had liked his wife so much why did he hate her #garden#
she wondered if she should ever see him but she knew that if she did she should not like him and he would not like her and that she should only stand and stare at him and say nothing though she should be wanting dreadfully to ask him why he had done such a queer #thing#
people never like me and i never like people she thought and i never can talk as the crawford children could
she thought of the robin and of the way he seemed to sing his song at her and as she remembered the tree top he perched on she stopped rather suddenly on the path
they were always talking and laughing and making noises i believe that tree was in the secret #garden# i feel sure it was she said
there was a wall round the place and there was no door she walked back into the first kitchen #garden# she had entered and found the old man digging there
she went and stood beside him and watched him a few moments in her cold little way he took no notice of her
and so at last she spoke to him i have been into the other #garden# she said there was nothin to prevent thee he answered crustily
i went into the orchard there was no dog at th door to bite thee he answered
there was no door there into the other #garden# said $mary_lennox$ what #garden# he said in a rough voice stopping his digging for a moment
the #one# on the other side of the wall answered mistress $mary_lennox$ there are trees there i saw the tops of them
a bird with a red breast was sitting on #one# of them and he sang to her surprise the surly old weather beaten face actually changed its #expression#
a slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite different it made her think that it was curious how much nicer a person looked when he smiled
she had not thought of it before he turned about to the orchard side of his #garden# and began to whistle a low soft whistle
she could not understand how such a surly man could make such a coaxing #sound# almost the next moment a wonderful #thing# happened
she heard a soft little rushing flight through the air and it was the bird with the red breast flying to them and he actually alighted on the big clod of earth quite near to the gardener foot
here he is chuckled the old man and then he spoke to the bird as if he were speaking to a child
where has #tha# been #tha# cheeky little beggar he said i ve not seen thee before today has #tha# begun #tha# courtin this early in th season
the bird put his tiny head on #one# side and looked up at him with his soft bright #eye# which was like a black dewdrop
#tha# rt too forrad he seemed quite familiar and not the least afraid he hopped about and pecked the earth briskly looking for seeds and insects
it actually gave $mary_lennox$ a queer feeling in her heart because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a person
he had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak and slender delicate legs will he always come when you call him
she asked almost in a whisper aye that he will i ve knowed him ever since he was a fledgling
he come out of th nest in th other #garden# an when first he flew over th wall he was too weak to fly back for a few #day#
when he went over th wall again th rest of th brood was gone an he was lonely an he come back to me
an we got friendly what kind of a bird is he $mary_lennox$ asked doesnt #tha# know he a robin redbreast
an they re th friendliest curiousest birds alive they re almost as friendly as dogs if you know how to get on with em
watch him peckin about there an lookin round at us now an again he knows we re talkin about him it was the queerest #thing# in the #world# to see the old fellow
he looked at the plump little scarlet waistcoated bird as if he were both proud and fond of him he a conceited #one# he chuckled
he likes to hear folk talk about him an curious bless me there never was his like for curiosity an meddlin
he always comin to see what i plantin he knows all th #thing# $mester_colin$ $mr_archibald_craven$ never troubles hissel to find out
he th head gardener he is the robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stopped and looked at them a little
$mary_lennox$ thought his black dewdrop #eye# gazed at her with great curiosity it really seemed as if he were finding out all about her
the queer feeling in her heart increased where did the rest of the brood fly to she asked
there no knowin the old #one# turn em out their nest an make em fly an they re scattered before you know it
this #one# was a knowin #one# an he knew he was lonely mistress $mary_lennox$ went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him very hard
i lonely she said she had not known before that this was #one# of the #thing# which made her feel sour and cross
she seemed to find it out when the robin looked at her and she looked at the robin the old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head and stared at her a minute
art #tha# th little wench from india he asked $mary_lennox$ nodded then no wonder #tha# rt lonely #tha# lt be lonlier before #tha# done he said
he began to dig again driving his spade deep into the rich black #garden# soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed
$ben_weatherstaff$ he answered and then he added with a surly chuckle i lonely mysel except when he with me and he jerked his thumb toward the robin
what is your name $mary_lennox$ inquired he stood up to answer her he th only friend i ve got
i have no friends at all said $mary_lennox$ i never had my ayah didnt like me and i never played with any #one#
it is a $yorkshire$ habit to say what you think with blunt frankness and old $ben_weatherstaff$ was a $yorkshire$ moor man
#tha# an me are a good bit alike he said we was wove out of th same cloth
we re neither of us good lookin an we re both of us as sour as we look we ve got the same nasty tempers both of us i ll warrant
this was plain speaking and $mary_lennox$ had never heard the truth about herself in her life native servants always salaamed and submitted to you whatever you did
she had never thought much about her looks but she wondered if she was as unattractive as $ben_weatherstaff$ and she also wondered if she looked as sour as he had looked before the robin came
she actually began to wonder also if she was nasty tempered she felt uncomfortable suddenly a clear rippling little #sound# broke out near her and she turned round
she was standing a few feet from a young apple tree and the robin had flown on to #one# of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of a song
$ben_weatherstaff$ laughed outright what did he do that for asked $mary_lennox$ he made up his mind to make friends with thee replied $ben_weatherstaff$
dang me if he hasnt took a fancy to thee to me said $mary_lennox$ and she moved toward the little tree softly and looked up
would you make friends with me she said to the robin just as if she was speaking to a person
and she did not say it either in her hard little voice or in her imperious indian voice but in a tone so soft and eager and coaxing that $ben_weatherstaff$ was as surprised as she had been when she heard him whistle
why he cried out #tha# said that as nice an human as if #tha# was a real child instead of a sharp old woman
would you #tha# said it almost like $dickon$ talks to his wild #thing# on th moor do you know $dickon$
$mary_lennox$ asked turning round rather in a hurry everybody knows him $dickon$ wanderin about everywhere th very blackberries an heather bells knows him
i warrant th foxes shows him where their cubs lies an th skylarks doesnt hide their nests from him $mary_lennox$ would have liked to ask some more questions
but just that moment the robin who had ended his song gave a little shake of his wings spread them and flew away
she was almost as curious about $dickon$ as she was about the deserted #garden# he had made his visit and had other #thing# to do
he has flown over the wall $mary_lennox$ cried out watching him he has flown into the orchard he has flown across the other wall into the #garden# where there is no door
he lives there said old $ben_weatherstaff$ he came out th egg there if he courtin he makin up to some young madam of a robin that lives among th old rose trees there
rose trees said $mary_lennox$ are there rose trees $ben_weatherstaff$ took up his spade again and began to dig there was ten year ago he mumbled
i should like to see them said $mary_lennox$ where is the green door there must be a door somewhere
$ben_weatherstaff$ drove his spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as he had looked when she first saw him there was ten year ago but there isnt now he said
no door cried $mary_lennox$ there must be none as any #one# can find an none as is any #one# business
dont you be a meddlesome wench an poke your nose where it no cause to go here i must go on with my work
and he actually stopped digging threw his spade over his shoulder and walked off without even glancing at her or saying good by
get you gone an play you i ve no more time #chapter# the cry in the corridor at first each #day# which passed by for $mary_lennox$ was exactly like the others
every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found $martha$ kneeling upon the hearth building her fire every morning she ate her breakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it and after each breakfast she gazed out of the window across to the huge moor which seemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky and after she had stared for a while she realized that if she did not go out she would have to stay in and do nothing and so she went out
she did not know that this was the best #thing# she could have done and she did not know that when she began to walk quickly or even run along the paths and down the avenue she was stirring her slow blood and making herself stronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor
she ran only to make herself warm and she hated the wind which rushed at her face and roared and held her back as if it were some giant she could not see
but the big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather filled her lungs with something which was good for her whole thin body and whipped some red #color# into her cheeks and brightened her dull #eye# when she did not know anything about it
but after a few #day# spent almost entirely out of doors she wakened #one# morning knowing what it was to be hungry and when she sat down to her breakfast she did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push it away but took up her spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it until her bowl was empty
#tha# got on well enough with that this mornin didnt #tha# said $martha$ it tastes nice today said $mary_lennox$ feeling a little surprised her self
it th air of th moor that givin thee stomach for #tha# victuals answered $martha$ it lucky for thee that #tha# got victuals as well as appetite
there been twelve in our cottage as had th stomach an nothin to put in it you go on playin you out doors every #day# an you ll get some flesh on your bones
an you wont be so yeller i dont play said $mary_lennox$ i have nothing to play with nothin to play with exclaimed $martha$
our children plays with sticks and stones they just runs about an shouts an looks at #thing# $mary_lennox$ did not shout but she looked at #thing#
there was nothing else to do she walked round and round the #garden# and wandered about the paths in the park
sometimes she looked for $ben_weatherstaff$ but though several times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at her or was too surly
once when she was walking toward him he picked up his spade and turned away as if he did it on purpose
#one# place she went to oftener than to any other it was the long walk outside the #garden# with the walls round them
there were bare flower beds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly there was #one# part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves were more bushy than elsewhere
the rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed at all
a few #day# after she had talked to $ben_weatherstaff$ $mary_lennox$ stopped to notice this and wondered why it was so
she had just paused and was looking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she saw a gleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp and there on the top of the wall forward perched $ben_weatherstaff$ robin redbreast tilting forward to look at her with his small head on #one# side
it seemed as if for a long time that part had been neglected oh she cried out is it you is it you
and it did not seem at all queer to her that she spoke to him as if she were sure that he would understand and answer her
he did answer he twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if he were telling her all sorts of #thing#
it seemed to mistress $mary_lennox$ as if she understood him too though he was not speaking in words it was as if he said good morning
isnt the wind nice isnt the sun nice isnt everything nice let us both chirp and hop and twitter come on
come on $mary_lennox$ began to laugh and as he hopped and took little flights along the wall she ran after him
she cried out pattering down the walk and she chirped and tried to whistle which last she did not know how to do in the least
poor little thin sallow ugly $mary_lennox$ she actually looked almost pretty for a moment i like you i like you but the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped and whistled back at her
at last he spread his wings and made a darting flight to the top of a tree where he perched and sang loudly
that reminded $mary_lennox$ of the first time she had seen him he had been swinging on a tree top then and she had been standing in the orchard
now she was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the path outside a wall much lower down and there was the same tree inside
it in the #garden# no #one# can go into she said to herself it the #garden# without a door
he lives in there how i wish i could see what it is like she ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first morning
then she ran down the path through the other door and then into the orchard and when she stood and looked up there was the tree on the other side of the wall and there was the robin just finishing his song and beginning to preen his feathers with his beak
she walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall but she only found what she had found before that there was no door in it
then she ran through the kitchen #garden# again and out into the walk outside the long ivy covered wall and she walked to the end of it and looked at it but there was no door and then she walked to the other end looking again but there was no door
it is the #garden# she said i am sure it is it very queer she said
$ben_weatherstaff$ said there was no door and there is no door but there must have been #one# ten years ago because $mr_archibald_craven$ buried the key
this gave her so much to think of that she began to be quite interested and feel that she was not sorry that she had come to misselthwaite manor
the fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had begun to blow the cobwebs out of her young brain and to waken her up a little
she stayed out of doors nearly all #day# and when she sat down to her supper at night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable
in india she had always felt hot and too languid to care much about anything she did not feel cross when $martha$ chattered away
she felt as if she rather liked to hear her and at last she thought she would ask her a question
she asked it after she had finished her supper and had sat down on the hearth rug before the fire why did $mr_archibald_craven$ hate the #garden#
she was very young and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers and #sister# and she found it dull in the great servants hall downstairs where the footman and upper housemaids made fun of her $yorkshire$ speech and looked upon her as a common little #thing# and sat and whispered among themselves
$martha$ liked to talk and the strange child who had lived in india and been waited upon by blacks was novelty enough to attract her
she said she had made $martha$ stay with her and $martha$ had not objected at all she sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked
art #tha# thinkin about that #garden# yet she said i knew #tha# would that was just the way with me when i first heard about it
why did he hate it $mary_lennox$ persisted $martha$ tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable listen to th wind wutherin round the house she said
you could bare stand up on the moor if you was out on it tonight $mary_lennox$ did not know what wutherin meant until she listened and then she understood
it must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar which rushed round and round the house as if the giant no #one# could see were buffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in
but #one# knew he could not get in and somehow it made #one# feel very safe and warm inside a room with a red coal fire
but why did he hate it so she asked after she had listened she intended to know if $martha$ did
then $martha$ gave up her store of knowledge mind she said $mrs_medlock$ said it not to be talked about
there lots #thing# in this place that not to be talked over that $mr_archibald_craven$ orders his troubles are none servants business he says
it was mrs $mr_archibald_craven$ #garden# that she had made when first they were married an she just loved it an they used to tend the flowers themselves
but for th #garden# he wouldnt be like he is an none th gardeners was ever let to go in
an she was just a bit of a girl an there was an old tree with a branch bent like a seat on it
him an her used to go in an shut th door an stay there hours an hours readin and talkin an she made roses grow over it an she used to sit there
but #one# #day# when she was sittin there th branch broke an she fell on th ground an was hurt so bad that next #day# she died
th doctors thought he go out his mind an die too that why he hates it no #one# never gone in since an he wont let any #one# talk about it
$mary_lennox$ did not ask any more questions she looked at the red fire and listened to the wind wutherin
it seemed to be wutherin louder than ever at that moment a very good #thing# was happening to her four good #thing# had happened to her in fact since she came to misselthwaite manor
she had felt as if she had understood a robin and that he had understood her she had run in the wind until her blood had grown warm she had been healthily hungry for the first time in her life and she had found out what it was to be sorry for some #one#
but as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to something else she did not know what it was because at first she could scarcely distinguish it from the wind itself
sometimes the wind sounded rather like a child #crying# but presently mistress $mary_lennox$ felt quite sure this #sound# was inside the house not outside it
it was a curious #sound# it seemed almost as if a child were #crying# somewhere it was far away but it was inside
she turned round and looked at $martha$ do you hear any #one# #crying# she said $martha$ suddenly looked confused
no she answered it th wind sometimes it #sound# like as if some #one# was lost on th moor an wailin
it got all sorts #sound# but listen said $mary_lennox$ it in the house down #one# of those long corridors
and at that very moment a door must have been opened somewhere downstairs for a great rushing draft blew along the passage and the door of the room they sat in was blown open with a crash and as they both jumped to their feet the light was blown out and the #crying# #sound# was swept down the far corridor so that it was to be heard more plainly than ever
there said $mary_lennox$ i told you so it is some #one# #crying# and it isnt a grown up person
$martha$ ran and shut the door and turned the key but before she did it they both heard the #sound# of a door in some far passage shutting with a bang and then everything was quiet for even the wind ceased wutherin for a few moments
it was th wind said $martha$ stubbornly an if it wasnt it was little betty butterworth th scullery maid she had th toothache all #day#
but something troubled and awkward in her manner made mistress $mary_lennox$ stare very hard at her she did not believe she was speaking the truth
the next #day# the rain poured down in torrents again and when $mary_lennox$ looked out of her window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and cloud
#chapter# vi there was some #one# #crying# there was there could be no going out today what do you do in your cottage when it rains like this
she asked $martha$ try to keep from under each other feet mostly $martha$ answered eh there does seem a lot of us then
mother a good tempered woman but she gets fair moithered the biggest #one# goes out in th cow shed and plays there $dickon$ he doesnt mind th wet
he goes out just th same as if th sun was shinin he says he sees #thing# on rainy #day# as doesnt show when it fair weather
he once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he brought it home in th bosom of his shirt to keep it warm
its mother had been killed nearby an th hole was swum out an th rest th litter was dead he got it at home now
he found a half drowned young crow another time an he brought it home too an tamed it it named soot because it so black an it hops an flies about with him everywhere
the time had come when $mary_lennox$ had forgotten to resent $martha$ familiar talk she had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she stopped or went away
the stories she had been told by her ayah when she lived in india had been quite unlike those $martha$ had to tell about the moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four little rooms and never had quite enough to eat
the children seemed to tumble about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough good natured collie puppies $mary_lennox$ was most attracted by the mother and $dickon$
when $martha$ told stories of what mother said or did they always sounded comfortable if i had a raven or a fox cub i could play with it said $mary_lennox$
but i have nothing $martha$ looked perplexed can #tha# knit she asked no answered $mary_lennox$
can #tha# sew no can #tha# read yes then why doesnt #tha# read somethin or learn a bit spellin
#tha# st old enough to be learnin thy book a good bit now i havent any books said $mary_lennox$ those i had were left in india
that a pity said $martha$ if $mrs_medlock$ let thee go into th library there thousands books there
$mary_lennox$ did not ask where the library was because she was suddenly inspired by a new idea she made up her mind to go and find it herself
she was not troubled about $mrs_medlock$ mrs $mrs_medlock$ seemed always to be in her comfortable housekeeper sitting room downstairs in this queer place #one# scarcely ever saw any #one# at all
in fact there was no #one# to see but the servants and when their master was away they lived a luxurious life below stairs where there was a huge kitchen hung about with shining brass and pewter and a large servants hall where there were four or five abundant meals eaten every #day# and where a great deal of lively romping went on when $mrs_medlock$ was out of the way
$mrs_medlock$ came and looked at her every #day# or two but no #one# inquired what she did or told her what to do
$mary_lennox$ meals were served regularly and $martha$ waited on her but no #one# troubled themselves about her in the least she supposed that perhaps this was the english way of treating children
in india she had always been attended by her ayah who had followed her about and waited on her hand and foot
now she was followed by nobody and was learning to dress herself because $martha$ looked as though she thought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have #thing# handed to her and put on
she had often been tired of her company hasnt #tha# got good sense she said once when $mary_lennox$ had stood waiting for her to put on her gloves for her
our $susan_sowerby$ ann is twice as sharp as thee an she only four year old sometimes #tha# looks fair soft in th head
$mary_lennox$ had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that but it made her think several entirely new #thing#
she stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after $martha$ had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs
she did not care very much about the library itself because she had read very few books but to hear of it brought back to her mind the hundred rooms with closed doors
she wondered if they were all really locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them
she was thinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the library were there a hundred really
why shouldnt she go and see how many doors she could count it would be something to do on this morning when she could not go out
she had never been taught to ask permission to do #thing# and she knew nothing at all about authority so she would not have thought it necessary to ask $mrs_medlock$ if she might walk about the house even if she had seen her
it was a long corridor and it branched into other corridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted to others again
she opened the door of the room and went into the corridor and then she began her wanderings there were doors and doors and there were pictures on the walls
sometimes they were pictures of dark curious landscapes but oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer grand costumes made of satin and velvet
she found herself in #one# long gallery whose walls were covered with these portraits she had never thought there could be so many in any house
she walked slowly down this place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her she felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from india was doing in their house
some were pictures of children little girls in thick satin frocks which reached to their feet and stood out about them and boys with puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair or with big ruffs around their necks
she always stopped to look at the children and wonder what their names were and where they had gone and why they wore such odd clothes
there was a stiff plain little girl rather like herself she wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on her finger
her #eye# had a sharp curious look where do you live now said $mary_lennox$ aloud to her i wish you were here
it seemed as if there was no #one# in all the huge rambling house but her own small self wandering about upstairs and down through narrow passages and wide #one# where it seemed to her that no #one# but herself had ever walked
since so many rooms had been built people must have lived in them but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it true
surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning it was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of turning the handle of a door
all the doors were shut as $mrs_medlock$ had said they were but at last she put her hand on the handle of #one# of them and turned it
she was almost frightened for a moment when she felt that it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon the door itself it slowly and heavily opened
there were embroidered hangings on the wall and inlaid furniture such as she had seen in india stood about the room
a broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor and over the mantel was another portrait of the stiff plain little girl who seemed to stare at her more curiously than ever
it was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom perhaps she slept here once said $mary_lennox$ she stares at me so that she makes me feel queer
she saw so many rooms that she became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred though she had not counted them
after that she opened more doors and more in all of them there were old pictures or old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them
in #one# room which looked like a lady sitting room the hangings were all embroidered velvet and in a cabinet were about a hundred little elephants made of ivory
there were curious pieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of them they were of different sizes and some had their mahouts or palanquins on their backs
some were much bigger than the others and some were so tiny that they seemed only #baby# $mary_lennox$ had seen carved ivory in india and she knew all about elephants
she opened the door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with these for quite a long time
in all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms she had seen nothing alive but in this room she saw something
when she got tired she set the elephants in order and shut the door of the cabinet just after she had closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling #sound#
in the corner of the sofa there was a cushion and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole and out of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened #eye# in it
it made her jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace from which it seemed to come $mary_lennox$ crept softly across the room to look
the bright #eye# belonged to a little gray mouse and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a comfortable nest there
if there was no #one# else alive in the hundred rooms there were seven mice who did not look lonely at all
six #baby# mice were cuddled up asleep near her if they wouldnt be so frightened i would take them back with me said $mary_lennox$
two or three times she lost her way by turning down the wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and down until she found the right #one# but at last she reached her own floor again though she was some distance from her own room and did not know exactly where she was
i believe i have taken a wrong turning again she said standing still at what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the wall
she had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any farther and she turned back i dont know which way to go
it was while she was standing here and just after she had said this that the stillness was broken by a #sound#
it was another cry but not quite like the #one# she had heard last night it was only a short #one# a fretful childish whine muffled by passing through walls
how still everything is it nearer than it was said $mary_lennox$ her heart beating rather faster and it is #crying#
the tapestry was the covering of a door which fell open and showed her that there was another part of the corridor behind it and $mrs_medlock$ was coming up it with her bunch of keys in her hand and a very cross look on her face
she put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her and then sprang back feeling quite startled what are you doing here
she said and she took $mary_lennox$ by the arm and pulled her away what did i tell you
i turned round the wrong corner explained $mary_lennox$ i didnt know which way to go and i heard some #one# #crying#
she quite hated $mrs_medlock$ at the moment but she hated her more the next you didnt hear anything of the sort said the housekeeper
and she took her by the arm and half pushed half pulled her up #one# passage and down another until she pushed her in at the door of her own room
you come along back to your own nursery or i ll box your ears now she said you stay where you re told to stay or
you ll find yourself locked up the master had better get you a governess same as he said he would you re #one# that needs some #one# to look sharp after you
she went out of the room and slammed the door after her and $mary_lennox$ went and sat on the hearth rug pale with rage
i ve got enough to do she did not cry but ground her teeth there was some #one# #crying# there was there was
she said to herself she had heard it twice now and sometime she would find out she had found out a great deal this morning
she felt as if she had been on a long journey and at any rate she had had something to amuse her all the time and she had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray mouse and its #baby# in their nest in the velvet cushion
#chapter# vii the key to the #garden# two #day# after this when $mary_lennox$ opened her #eye# she sat upright in bed immediately and called to $martha$
look at the moor look at the moor the rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept away in the night by the wind
the wind itself had ceased and a brilliant deep blue sky arched high over the moorland never never had $mary_lennox$ dreamed of a sky so blue
in india skies were hot and blazing this was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters of some lovely bottomless lake and here and there high high in the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow white fleece
the far reaching #world# of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of gloomy purple black or awful dreary gray aye said $martha$ with a cheerful grin
th storm over for a bit it does like this at this time th year it goes off in a night like it was pretendin it had never been here
an never meant to come again that because th springtime on its way it a long way off yet but it comin
i thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in england $mary_lennox$ said eh no said $martha$ sitting up on her heels among her black lead brushes
in india the natives spoke different dialects which only a few people understood so she was not surprised when $martha$ used words she did not know
nowt th soart what does that mean asked $mary_lennox$ seriously $martha$ laughed as she had done the first morning
there now she said i ve talked broad $yorkshire$ again like $mrs_medlock$ said i mustnt nowt th soart means nothin of the sort slowly and carefully but it takes so long to say it
$yorkshire$ th sunniest place on earth when it is sunny i told thee #tha# like th moor after a bit just you wait till you see
th gold colored gorse blossoms an th blossoms th broom an th heather flowerin all purple bells an hundreds butterflies flutterin an bees hummin an skylarks soarin up an singin
you ll want to get out on it as sunrise an live out on it all #day# like $dickon$ does could i ever get there asked $mary_lennox$ wistfully looking through her window at the far off blue
it was so new and big and wonderful and such a heavenly #color# i dont know answered $martha$ #tha# never used #tha# legs since #tha# was born it seems to me
$martha$ stared at her a moment curiously before she took up her polishing brush and began to rub the grate again
she was thinking that the small plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done the first morning she saw it
#tha# couldnt walk five mile it five mile to our cottage i should like to see your cottage it looked just a trifle like little $susan_sowerby$ ann when she wanted something very much
i ll ask my mother about it she said she #one# them that nearly always sees a way to do #thing#
it my #day# out today an i goin home eh i am glad $mrs_medlock$ thinks a lot mother perhaps she could talk to her
i like your mother said $mary_lennox$ i should think #tha# did agreed $martha$ polishing away i ve never seen her said $mary_lennox$
she sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with the back of her hand as if puzzled for a moment but she ended quite positively
well she that sensible an hard workin an goodnatured an clean that no #one# could help likin her whether they seen her or not
no #tha# hasnt replied $martha$ when i goin home to her on my #day# out i just jump for joy when i crossin the moor
i like $dickon$ added $mary_lennox$ and i ve never seen him well said $martha$ stoutly i ve told thee that th very birds likes him
an th rabbits an wild sheep an ponies an th foxes themselves i wonder staring at her reflectively what $dickon$ would think of thee
he wouldnt like me said $mary_lennox$ in her stiff cold little way no #one# does $martha$ looked reflective again
how does #tha# like thysel she inquired really quite as if she were curious to know $mary_lennox$ hesitated a moment and thought it over
not at all really she answered but i never thought of that before $martha$ grinned a little as if at some homely recollection
she was at her wash tub an i was in a bad temper an talkin ill of folk an she turns round on me an says #tha# young vixen #tha#
mother said that to me once she said there #tha# stands sayin #tha# doesnt like this #one# an #tha# doesnt like that #one#
how does #tha# like thysel it made me laugh an it brought me to my senses in a minute she went away in high spirits as soon as she had given $mary_lennox$ her breakfast
she was going to walk five miles across the moor to the cottage and she was going to help her mother with the washing and do the week baking and enjoy herself thoroughly
she went out into the #garden# as quickly as possible and the first #thing# she did was to run round and round the fountain flower #garden# ten times
$mary_lennox$ felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in the house she counted the times carefully and when she had finished she felt in better spirits
the high deep blue sky arched over misselthwaite as well as over the moor and she kept lifting her face and looking up into it trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on #one# of the little snow white clouds and float about
the sunshine made the whole place look different she went into the first kitchen #garden# and found $ben_weatherstaff$ working there with two other gardeners
the change in the weather seemed to have done him good he spoke to her of his own accord springtime comin he said
cannot #tha# smell it $mary_lennox$ sniffed and thought she could i smell something nice and fresh and damp she said
that th good rich earth he answered digging away it in a good humor makin ready to grow #thing#
it glad when plantin time comes it dull in th winter when it got nowt to do in th flower #garden# out there #thing# will be stirrin down below in th dark
th sun warmin em you ll see bits green spikes stickin out th black earth after a bit what will they be asked $mary_lennox$
crocuses an snowdrops an daffydowndillys has #tha# never seen them no everything is hot and wet and green after the rains in india said $mary_lennox$
and i think #thing# grow up in a night these wont grow up in a night said $ben_weatherstaff$
#tha# ll have to wait for em they ll poke up a bit higher here an push out a spike more there an uncurl a leaf this #day# an another that
very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she knew at once that the robin had come again
he was very pert and lively and hopped about so close to her feet and put his head on #one# side and looked at her so slyly that she asked $ben_weatherstaff$ a question
you watch em i am going to answered $mary_lennox$ do you think he remembers me she said remembers thee
said $ben_weatherstaff$ indignantly he knows every cabbage stump in th #garden# let alone th people he never seen a little wench here before an he bent on findin out all about thee
#tha# no need to try to hide anything from him are #thing# stirring down below in the dark in that #garden# where he lives
$mary_lennox$ inquired what #garden# grunted $ben_weatherstaff$ becoming surly again the #one# where the old rose trees are she could not help asking because she wanted so much to know
are all the flowers dead or do some of them come again in the summer are there ever any roses
ask him said $ben_weatherstaff$ hunching his shoulders toward the robin he the only #one# as knows no #one# else has seen inside it for ten year
ten years was a long time $mary_lennox$ thought she had been born ten years ago she walked away slowly thinking
she had begun to like the #garden# just as she had begun to like the robin and $dickon$ and $martha$ mother
she was beginning to like $martha$ too that seemed a good many people to like when you were not used to liking
she went to her walk outside the long ivy covered wall over which she could see the tree tops and the second time she walked up and down the most interesting and exciting #thing# happened to her and it was all through $ben_weatherstaff$ robin
she heard a chirp and a twitter and when she looked at the bare flower bed at her left side there he was hopping about and pretending to peck #thing# out of the earth to persuade her that he had not followed her
but she knew he had followed her and the surprise so filled her with delight that she almost trembled a little
she thought of the robin as #one# of the people you do remember me she cried out you do
you are prettier than anything else in the #world# she chirped and talked and coaxed and he hopped and flirted his tail and twittered
his red waistcoat was like satin and he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand and so pretty that it was really as if he were showing her how important and like a human person a robin could be
mistress $mary_lennox$ forgot that she had ever been contrary in her life when he allowed her to draw closer and closer to him and bend down and talk and try to make something like robin #sound#
it was as if he were talking oh to think that he should actually let her come as near to him as that
he knew nothing in the #world# would make her put out her hand toward him or startle him in the least tiniest way
he knew it because he was a real person only nicer than any other person in the #world# she was so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe
it was bare of flowers because the perennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest but there were tall shrubs and low #one# which grew together at the back of the bed and as the robin hopped about under them she saw him hop over a small pile of freshly turned up earth
the earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a mole and he had scratched quite a deep hole
$mary_lennox$ looked at it not really knowing why the hole was there and as she looked she saw something almost buried in the newly turned soil
it was something like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew up into a tree nearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up
it was more than a ring however it was an old key which looked as if it had been buried a long time
the flower bed was not quite bare he stopped on it to look for a worm mistress $mary_lennox$ stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face as it hung from her finger
perhaps it has been buried for ten years she said in a whisper perhaps it is the key to the #garden#
#chapter# viii the robin who showed the way she looked at the key quite a long time she turned it over and over and thought about it
as i have said before she was not a child who had been trained to ask permission or consult her elders about #thing#
all she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed #garden# and she could find out where the door was she could perhaps open it and see what was inside the walls and what had happened to the old rose trees
it seemed as if it must be different from other places and that something strange must have happened to it during ten years
besides that if she liked it she could go into it every #day# and shut the door behind her and she could make up some play of her own and play it quite alone because nobody would ever know where she was but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth
it was because it had been shut up so long that she wanted to see it the thought of that pleased her very much
living as it were all by herself in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuse herself had set her inactive brain to working and was actually awakening her imagination
there is no doubt that the fresh strong pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it
just as it had given her an appetite and fighting with the wind had stirred her blood so the same #thing# had stirred her mind
in india she had always been too hot and languid and weak to care much about anything but in this place she was beginning to care and to want to do new #thing#
already she felt less contrary though she did not know why she put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk
no #one# but herself ever seemed to come there so she could walk slowly and look at the wall or rather at the ivy growing on it
the ivy was the baffling #thing# howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing but thickly growing glossy dark green leaves
something of her contrariness came back to her as she paced the walk and looked over it at the tree tops inside
she was very much disappointed it seemed so silly she said to herself to be near it and not be able to get in
she took the key in her pocket when she went back to the house and she made up her mind that she would always carry it with her when she went out so that if she ever should find the hidden door she would be ready
$mrs_medlock$ had allowed $martha$ to sleep all night at the cottage but she was back at her work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever and in the best of spirits
eh it was pretty on th moor with th birds gettin up an th rabbits scamperin about an th sun risin
i got up at four clock she said i didnt walk all th way a man gave me a ride in his cart an i did enjoy myself
her mother had been glad to see her and they had got the baking and washing all out of the way
she was full of stories of the delights of her #day# out she had even made each of the children a doughcake with a bit of brown sugar in it
i had em all pipin hot when they came in from playin on th moor an th cottage all smelt
o nice clean hot bakin an there was a good fire an they just shouted for joy our $dickon$ he said our cottage was good enough for a king
in the evening they had all sat round the fire and $martha$ and her mother had sewed patches on torn clothes and mended stockings and $martha$ had told them about the little girl who had come from india and who had been waited on all her life by what $martha$ called blacks until she didnt know how to put on her own stockings
eh they did like to hear about you said $martha$ they wanted to know all about th blacks an about th ship you came in
i ll tell you a great deal more before your next #day# out she said so that you will have more to talk about
i dare say they would like to hear about riding on elephants and camels and about the officers going to hunt tigers
i couldnt tell em enough $mary_lennox$ reflected a little my word cried delighted $martha$ it would set em clean off their heads
would #tha# really do that miss it would be same as a wild beast show like we heard they had in york once
india is quite different from $yorkshire$ $mary_lennox$ said slowly as she thought the matter over i never thought of that
did $dickon$ and your mother like to hear you talk about me why our $dickon$ #eye# nearly started out his head they got that round answered $martha$
but mother she was put out about your seemin to be all by yourself like she said hasnt $mr_archibald_craven$ got no governess for her nor no nurse
and i said no he hasnt though $mrs_medlock$ says he will when he thinks of it but she says he maynt think of it for two or three years
i dont want a governess said $mary_lennox$ sharply but mother says you ought to be learnin your book by this time
an you ought to have a woman to look after you an she says now $martha$ you just think how you feel yourself in a big place like that wanderin about all alone an no mother
you do your best to cheer her up she says an i said i would $mary_lennox$ gave her a long steady look
you do cheer me up she said i like to hear you talk presently $martha$ went out of the room and came back with something held in her hands under her apron
what does #tha# think she said with a cheerful grin i ve brought thee a present a present exclaimed mistress $mary_lennox$
how could a cottage full of fourteen hungry people give any #one# a present a man was drivin across the moor peddlin $martha$ explained
an he stopped his cart at our door he had pots an pans an odds an ends but mother had no money to buy anythin
just as he was goin away our lizabeth ellen called out mother he got skippin ropes with red an blue handles an mother she calls out quite sudden here stop mister
an he says tuppence an mother she began fumblin in her pocket an she says to me $martha$ #tha# brought me thy wages like a good lass an i ve got four places to put every penny but i just goin to take tuppence out of it to buy that child a skippin rope
how much are they an she bought #one# an here it is she brought it out from under her apron and exhibited it quite proudly
it was a strong slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at each end but $mary_lennox$ had never seen a skipping rope before
she gazed at it with a mystified #expression# what is it for she asked curiously for cried out $martha$
does #tha# mean that they ve not got skippin ropes in india for all they ve got elephants and tigers and camels no wonder most of em black
and she ran into the middle of the room and taking a handle in each hand began to skip and skip and skip while $mary_lennox$ turned in her chair to stare at her and the queer faces in the old portraits seemed to stare at her too and wonder what on earth this common little cottager had the impudence to be doing under their very noses
the interest and curiosity in mistress $mary_lennox$ face delighted her and she went on skipping and counted as she skipped until she had reached a hundred
this is what it for just watch me but $martha$ did not even see them i could skip longer than that she said when she stopped
i ve skipped as much as five hundred when i was twelve but i wasnt as fat then as i am now an i was in practice
$mary_lennox$ got up from her chair beginning to feel excited herself it looks nice she said your mother is a kind woman
do you think i could ever skip like that you just try it urged $martha$ handing her the skipping rope you cant skip a hundred at first but if you practice you ll mount up
that what mother said she says nothin will do her more good than skippin rope it th sensiblest toy a child can have
let her play out in th fresh air skippin an it ll stretch her legs an arms an give her some strength in em
it was plain that there was not a great deal of strength in mistress $mary_lennox$ arms and legs when she first began to skip
she was not very clever at it but she liked it so much that she did not want to stop
mother said i must tell you to keep out doors as much as you could even when it rains a bit so as #tha# wrap up warm
put on #tha# #thing# and run an skip out doors said $martha$ $mary_lennox$ put on her coat and hat and took her skipping rope over her arm
she opened the door to go out and then suddenly thought of something and turned back rather slowly $martha$ she said they were your wages
it was your two pence really thank you she said it stiffly because she was not used to thanking people or noticing that they did #thing# for her
thank you she said and held out her hand because she did not know what else to do $martha$ gave her hand a clumsy little shake as if she was not accustomed to this sort of #thing# either
then she laughed eh th art a queer old womanish #thing# she said if #tha# been our lizabeth ellen #tha# have given me a kiss
$mary_lennox$ looked stiffer than ever do you want me to kiss you $martha$ laughed again nay not me she answered
if #tha# was different raps #tha# want to thysel but #tha# isnt run off outside an play with thy rope
mistress $mary_lennox$ felt a little awkward as she went out of the room $yorkshire$ people seemed strange and $martha$ was always rather a puzzle to her
she counted and skipped and skipped and counted until her cheeks were quite red and she was more interested than she had ever been since she was born
the sun was shining and a little wind was blowing not a rough wind but #one# which came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned earth with it
at first she had disliked her very much but now she did not the skipping rope was a wonderful #thing# she skipped round the fountain #garden# and up #one# walk and down another
she skipped at last into the kitchen #garden# and saw $ben_weatherstaff$ digging and talking to his robin which was hopping about him
she skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted his head and looked at her with a curious #expression# she had wondered if he would notice her
she wanted him to see her skip well he exclaimed upon my word raps #tha# art a young
un after all an raps #tha# got child blood in thy veins instead of sour buttermilk #tha# skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name $ben_weatherstaff$
i wouldnt have believed #tha# could do it i never skipped before $mary_lennox$ said i just beginning i can only go up to twenty
#tha# keep on said $ben_weatherstaff$ #tha# shapes well enough at it for a young un that lived with heathen
just see how he watchin thee jerking his head toward the robin he followed after thee yesterday he ll be at it again today
shaking his head at the bird #tha# curiosity will be th death of thee sometime if #tha# doesnt look sharp
he ll be bound to find out what th skippin rope is he never seen #one# eh $mary_lennox$ skipped round all the #garden# and round the orchard resting every few minutes
at length she went to her own special walk and made up her mind to try if she could skip the whole length of it
it was a good long skip and she began slowly but before she had gone half way down the path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop
she stopped with a little laugh of pleasure and there lo and behold was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy
she did not mind much because she had already counted up to thirty he had followed her and he greeted her with a chirp
as $mary_lennox$ had skipped toward him she felt something heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump and when she saw the robin she laughed again
you showed me where the key was yesterday she said you ought to show me the door today but i dont believe you know
the robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he opened his beak and sang a loud lovely trill merely to show off
nothing in the #world# is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when he shows off and they are nearly always doing it
$mary_lennox$ had heard a great deal about $magic$ in her ayah stories and she always said that what happened almost at that moment was $magic$
#one# of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk and it was a stronger #one# than the rest
it was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall
$mary_lennox$ had stepped close to the robin and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy trails and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it in her hand
this she did because she had seen something under it a round knob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it
it was the knob of a door she put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside
thick as the ivy hung it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain though some had crept over wood and iron
the robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on #one# side as if he were as excited as she was
what was this under her hands which was square and made of iron and which her fingers found a hole in
$mary_lennox$ heart began to thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and excitement it was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years
and she put her hand in her pocket drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole she put the key in and turned it
and then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if any #one# was coming
no #one# ever did come it seemed and she took another long breath because she could not help it and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly slowly
then she slipped through it and shut it behind her and stood with her back against it looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement and wonder and delight
it took two hands to do it but it did turn no #one# was coming she was standing inside the secret #garden#
#chapter# ix the strangest house any #one# ever lived in it was the sweetest most mysterious looking place any #one# could imagine
the high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together
all the ground was covered with grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rosebushes if they were alive
$mary_lennox$ knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in india there were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees
there were other trees in the #garden# and #one# of the #thing# which made the place look strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over them and swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains and here and there they had caught at each other or at a far reaching branch and had crept from #one# tree to another and made lovely bridges of themselves
there were neither leaves nor roses on them now and $mary_lennox$ did not know whether they were dead or alive but their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything walls and trees and even brown grass where they had fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground
$mary_lennox$ had thought it must be different from other #garden# which had not been left all by themselves so long and indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life
it was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious how still it is
she whispered how still then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness the robin who had flown to his treetop was still as all the rest
he did not even flutter his wings he sat without stirring and looked at $mary_lennox$ no wonder it is still she whispered again
i am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years she moved away from the door stepping as softly as if she were afraid of awakening some #one#
she walked under #one# of the fairy like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them
she was glad that there was grass under her feet and that her steps made no #sound# i wonder if they are all quite dead she said
if she had been $ben_weatherstaff$ she could have told whether the wood was alive by looking at it but she could only see that there were only gray or brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even a tiny leaf bud anywhere
but she was inside the wonderful #garden# and she could come through the door under the ivy any time and she felt as if she had found a #world# all her own
the sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky over this particular piece of misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant and soft than it was over the moor
is it all a quite dead #garden# i wish it wasnt the robin flew down from his tree top and hopped about or flew after her from #one# bush to another
everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be hundreds of miles away from any #one# but somehow she did not feel lonely at all
all that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether all the roses were dead or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put out leaves and buds as the weather got warmer
he chirped a good deal and had a very busy air as if he were showing her #thing# she did not want it to be a quite dead #garden#
if it were a quite alive #garden# how wonderful it would be and what thousands of roses would grow on every side
her skipping rope had hung over her arm when she came in and after she had walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the whole #garden# stopping when she wanted to look at #thing#
there seemed to have been grass paths here and there and in #one# or two corners there were alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall moss covered flower urns in them
there had once been a flowerbed in it and she thought she saw something sticking out of the black earth some sharp little pale green points
as she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping she remembered what $ben_weatherstaff$ had said and she knelt down to look at them
yes they are tiny growing #thing# and they might be crocuses or snowdrops or daffodils she whispered she bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the damp earth
she liked it very much perhaps there are some other #one# coming up in other places she said i will go all over the #garden# and look
she looked in the old border beds and among the grass and after she had gone round trying to miss nothing she had found ever so many more sharp pale green points and she had become quite excited again
she did not skip but walked she went slowly and kept her #eye# on the ground it isnt a quite dead #garden# she cried out softly to herself
she did not know anything about gardening but the grass seemed so thick in some of the places where the green points were pushing their way through that she thought they did not seem to have room enough to grow
she searched about until she found a rather sharp piece of wood and knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she made nice little clear places around them
even if the roses are dead there are other #thing# alive now they look as if they could breathe she said after she had finished with the first #one#
i am going to do ever so many more i ll do all i can see if i havent time today i can come tomorrow
she went from place to place and dug and weeded and enjoyed herself so immensely that she was led on from bed to bed and into the grass under the trees
the exercise made her so warm that she first threw her coat off and then her hat and without knowing it she was smiling down on to the grass and the pale green points all the time
the robin was tremendously busy he was very much pleased to see gardening begun on his own estate he had often wondered at $ben_weatherstaff$
now here was this new kind of creature who was not half $ben_weatherstaff$ size and yet had had the sense to come into his #garden# and begin at once
where gardening is done all sorts of delightful #thing# to eat are turned up with the soil mistress $mary_lennox$ worked in her #garden# until it was time to go to her midday dinner
in fact she was rather late in remembering and when she put on her coat and hat and picked up her skipping rope she could not believe that she had been working two or three hours
she had been actually happy all the time and dozens and dozens of the tiny pale green points were to be seen in cleared places looking twice as cheerful as they had looked before when the grass and weeds had been smothering them
i shall come back this afternoon she said looking all round at her new kingdom and speaking to the trees and the rose bushes as if they heard her
then she ran lightly across the grass pushed open the slow old door and slipped through it under the ivy
she had such red cheeks and such bright #eye# and ate such a dinner that $martha$ was delighted two pieces o
meat an two helps rice puddin she said eh mother will be pleased when i tell her what th skippin rope done for thee
in the #course# of her digging with her pointed stick mistress $mary_lennox$ had found herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion
she had put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it and just now she wondered if $martha$ could tell her what it was
$martha$ she said what are those white roots that look like onions they re bulbs answered $martha$ lots spring flowers grow from em
th very little #one# are snowdrops an crocuses an th big #one# are narcissuses an jonquils and daffydowndillys th biggest of all is lilies an purple flags
eh they are nice $dickon$ got a whole lot of em planted in our bit #garden# does $dickon$ know all about them
asked $mary_lennox$ a new idea taking possession of her our $dickon$ can make a flower grow out of a brick walk
mother says he just whispers #thing# out th ground do bulbs live a long time would they live years and years if no #one# helped them
inquired $mary_lennox$ anxiously they re #thing# as helps themselves said $martha$ that why poor folk can afford to have em
if you dont trouble em most of em ll work away underground for a lifetime an spread out an have little uns
there a place in th park woods here where there snowdrops by thousands they re the prettiest sight in $yorkshire$ when th spring comes
no #one# knows when they was first planted i wish the spring was here now said $mary_lennox$ i want to see all the #thing# that grow in england
she had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat on the hearth rug i wish i wish i had a little spade she said
whatever does #tha# want a spade for asked $martha$ laughing art #tha# goin to take to diggin i must tell mother that too
$mary_lennox$ looked at the fire and pondered a little she must be careful if she meant to keep her secret kingdom
she wasnt doing any harm but if $mr_archibald_craven$ found out about the open door he would be fearfully angry and get a new key and lock it up forevermore
she really could not bear that this is such a big lonely place she said slowly as if she were turning matters over in her mind
the house is lonely and the park is lonely and the #garden# are lonely so many places seem shut up
i never did many #thing# in india but there were more people to look at natives and soldiers marching by and sometimes bands playing and my ayah told me stories
there is no #one# to talk to here except you and $ben_weatherstaff$ and you have to do your work and $ben_weatherstaff$ wont speak to me often
i thought if i had a little spade i could dig somewhere as he does and i might make a little #garden# if he would give me some seeds
$martha$ face quite lighted up there now she exclaimed if that wasnt #one# of th #thing# mother said
she says there such a lot room in that big place why dont they give her a bit for herself even if she doesnt plant nothin but parsley an radishes
she dig an rake away an be right down happy over it them was the very words she said were they said $mary_lennox$
it like she says a woman as brings up twelve children learns something besides her a c children as good as rithmetic to set you findin out #thing#
how many #thing# she knows doesnt she eh said $martha$ how much would a spade cost a little #one#
$mary_lennox$ asked well was $martha$ reflective answer at thwaite village there a shop or so an i saw little #garden# sets with a spade an a rake an a fork all tied together for two shillings
an they was stout enough to work with too i ve got more than that in my purse said $mary_lennox$ mrs morrison gave me five shillings and $mrs_medlock$ gave me some money from $mr_archibald_craven$
did he remember thee that much exclaimed $martha$ $mrs_medlock$ said i was to have a shilling a week to spend
she gives me #one# every saturday i didnt know what to spend it on my word that riches said $martha$
#tha# can buy anything in th #world# #tha# wants th rent of our cottage is only #one# an threepence an it like pullin #eye# teeth to get it
in the shop at thwaite they sell packages flower seeds for a penny each and our $dickon$ he knows which is th prettiest #one# an how to make em grow
now i ve just thought of somethin putting her hands on her hips what said $mary_lennox$ eagerly he walks over to thwaite many a #day# just for th fun of it
does #tha# know how to print letters suddenly i know how to write $mary_lennox$ answered $martha$ shook her head
our $dickon$ can only read printin if #tha# could print we could write a letter to him an ask him to go an buy th #garden# tools
an th seeds at th same time oh you re a good girl $mary_lennox$ cried you are really i didnt know you were so nice
i know i can print letters if i try let ask $mrs_medlock$ for a pen and ink and some paper
i ve got some of my own said $martha$ i bought em so i could print a bit of a letter to mother of a sunday
she ran out of the room and $mary_lennox$ stood by the fire and twisted her thin little hands together with sheer pleasure
i ll go and get it if i have a spade she whispered i can make the earth nice and soft and dig up weeds
if i have seeds and can make flowers grow the #garden# wont be dead at all it will come alive she did not go out again that afternoon because when $martha$ returned with her pen and ink and paper
she was obliged to clear the table and carry the plates and dishes downstairs and when she got into the kitchen
$mrs_medlock$ was there and told her to do something so $mary_lennox$ waited for what seemed to her a long time before she came back
then it was a serious piece of work to write to $dickon$ $mary_lennox$ had been taught very little because her governesses had disliked her too much to stay with her
she could not spell particularly well but she found that she could print letters when she tried this was the letter $martha$ dictated to her
miss $mary_lennox$ has plenty of money and will you go to thwaite and buy her some flower seeds and a set of #garden# tools to make a flower bed
pick the prettiest #one# and easy to grow because she has never done it before and lived in india which is different
my dear $dickon$ this comes hoping to find you well as it leaves me at present give my love to mother and every #one# of you
miss $mary_lennox$ is going to tell me a lot more so that on my next #day# out you can hear about elephants and camels and gentlemen going hunting lions and tigers
your loving #sister# $martha$ phoebe $susan_sowerby$ we ll put the money in th envelope an i ll get th butcher boy to take it in his cart
he a great friend $dickon$ said $martha$ how shall i get the #thing# when $dickon$ buys them he ll bring em to you himself
he ll like to walk over this way oh exclaimed $mary_lennox$ then i shall see him i never thought i should see $dickon$
does #tha# want to see him asked $martha$ suddenly for $mary_lennox$ had looked so pleased yes i do i never saw a boy foxes and crows loved
now to think she broke out to think me forgettin that there an i thought i was goin to tell you first #thing# this mornin
i want to see him very much $martha$ gave a little start as if she remembered something i asked mother and she said she ask $mrs_medlock$ her own self
ask her if you might be driven over to our cottage some #day# and have a bit mother hot oat cake an butter an a glass milk
do you mean $mary_lennox$ began what i said tuesday it seemed as if all the interesting #thing# were happening in #one# #day#
to think of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue to think of going into the cottage which held twelve children
does she think $mrs_medlock$ would let me go she asked quite anxiously aye she thinks she would
if i went i should see your mother as well as $dickon$ said $mary_lennox$ thinking it over and liking the idea very much
she knows what a tidy woman mother is and how clean she keeps the cottage she doesnt seem to be like the mothers in india
her work in the #garden# and the excitement of the afternoon ended by making her feel quiet and thoughtful $martha$ stayed with her until tea time but they sat in comfortable quiet and talked very little
but just before $martha$ went downstairs for the tea tray $mary_lennox$ asked a question $martha$ she said has the scullery maid had the toothache again today
$martha$ certainly started slightly what makes thee ask that she said because when i waited so long for you to come back
i opened the door and walked down the corridor to see if you were coming and i heard that far off #crying# again just as we heard it the other night
there isnt a wind today so you see it couldnt have been the wind eh said $martha$ restlessly #tha# mustnt go walkin about in corridors an listenin
$mr_archibald_craven$ would be that there angry there no knowin what he do i wasnt listening said $mary_lennox$ i was just waiting for you and i heard it
it the strangest house any #one# ever lived in said $mary_lennox$ drowsily as she dropped her head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near her
that three times my word there $mrs_medlock$ bell said $martha$ and she almost ran out of the room fresh air and digging and skipping rope had made her feel so comfortably tired that she fell asleep
#chapter# $dickon$ the sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret #garden# the secret #garden# was what $mary_lennox$ called it when she was thinking of it
she liked the name and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her in no #one# knew where she was
the few books she had read and liked had been fairy story books and she had read of secret #garden# in some of the stories
it seemed almost like being shut out of the #world# in some fairy place sometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred years which she had thought must be rather stupid
she had no intention of going to sleep and in fact she was becoming wider awake every #day# which passed at misselthwaite
she was beginning to like to be out of doors she no longer hated the wind but enjoyed it she could run faster and longer and she could skip up to a hundred
such nice clear places were made round them that they had all the breathing space they wanted and really if mistress $mary_lennox$ had known it they began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously
the sun could get at them and warm them and when the rain came down it could reach them at once so they began to feel very much alive
$mary_lennox$ was an odd determined little person and now she had something interesting to be determined about she was very much absorbed indeed
she worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily only becoming more pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it
the bulbs in the secret #garden# must have been much astonished it seemed to her like a fascinating sort of play
she found many more of the sprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find they seemed to be starting up everywhere and
there were so many that she remembered what $martha$ had said about the snowdrops by the thousands and about bulbs spreading and making new #one#
each #day# she was sure she found tiny new #one# some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth these had been left to themselves for ten years
and perhaps they had spread like the snowdrops into thousands she wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers
sometimes she stopped digging to look at the #garden# and try to imagine what it would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely #thing# in bloom
during that week of sunshine she became more intimate with $ben_weatherstaff$ she surprised him several times by seeming to start up beside him as if she sprang out of the earth
the truth was that she was afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming so she always walked toward him as silently as possible
but in fact he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first perhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company
he did not know that when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken to a native and had not known that a cross sturdy old $yorkshire$ man was not accustomed to salaam to his masters and be merely commanded by them to do #thing#
#tha# rt like th robin he said to her #one# morning when he lifted his head and saw her standing by him
then also she was more civil than she had been i never knows when i shall see thee or which side #tha# ll come from
he friends with me now said $mary_lennox$ that like him snapped $ben_weatherstaff$ makin up to th women folk just for vanity an flightiness
there nothin he wouldnt do for th sake showin off an flirtin his tail feathers he as full pride as an egg full meat
he very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer $mary_lennox$ questions except by a grunt but this morning he said more than usual
he stood up and rested #one# hobnailed boot on the top of his spade while he looked her over
how long has #tha# been here he jerked out i think it about a month she answered #tha# beginnin to do misselthwaite credit he said
#tha# a bit fatter than #tha# was an #tha# not quite so yeller #tha# looked like a young plucked crow when #tha# first came into this #garden#
thinks i to myself i never set #eye# on an uglier sourer faced young un $mary_lennox$ was not vain and as she had never thought much of her looks she was not greatly disturbed
i know i fatter she said my stockings are getting tighter they used to make wrinkles there the robin $ben_weatherstaff$
his red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings and tail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively graces
there indeed was the robin and she thought he looked nicer than ever he seemed determined to make $ben_weatherstaff$ admire him
but $ben_weatherstaff$ was sarcastic aye there #tha# art he said #tha# can put up with me for a bit sometimes when #tha# got no #one# better
#tha# courtin some bold young madam somewhere tellin thy lies to her about bein th finest cock robin on missel moor an ready to fight all th rest of em
#tha# been reddenin up thy waistcoat an polishin thy feathers this two weeks i know what #tha# up to oh look at him exclaimed $mary_lennox$
the robin was evidently in a fascinating bold mood he hopped closer and closer and looked at $ben_weatherstaff$ more and more engagingly
he flew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang a little song right at him
#tha# thinks #tha# ll get over me by doin that said $ben_weatherstaff$ wrinkling his face up in such a way that $mary_lennox$ felt sure he was trying not to look pleased
#tha# thinks no #one# can stand out against thee that what #tha# thinks the robin spread his wings $mary_lennox$ could scarcely believe her #eye#
he flew right up to the handle of $ben_weatherstaff$ spade and alighted on the top of it then the old man face wrinkled itself slowly into a new #expression#
he stood still as if he were afraid to breathe as if he would not have stirred for the #world# lest his robin should start away
he spoke quite in a whisper well i danged he said as softly as if he were saying something quite different
#tha# does know how to get at a chap #tha# does #tha# fair unearthly #tha# so knowin and he stood without stirring almost without drawing his breath until the robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away
then he stood looking at the handle of the spade as if there might be $magic$ in it and then he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes
but because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then $mary_lennox$ was not afraid to talk to him
have you a #garden# of your own she asked no i bachelder an lodge with martin at th gate
if you had #one# said $mary_lennox$ what would you plant cabbages an taters an onions but if you wanted to make a flower #garden# persisted $mary_lennox$ what would you plant
bulbs an sweet smellin #thing# but mostly roses $mary_lennox$ face lighted up do you like roses she said $ben_weatherstaff$ rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he answered
well yes i do i was learned that by a young lady i was gardener to she had a lot in a place she was fond of an she loved em like they was children or robins
i ve seen her bend over an kiss em he dragged out another weed and scowled at it that were as much as ten year ago
where is she now asked $mary_lennox$ much interested heaven he answered and drove his spade deep into the soil cording to what parson says
what happened to the roses $mary_lennox$ asked again more interested than ever they was left to themselves
$mary_lennox$ was becoming quite excited did they quite die do roses quite die when they are left to themselves
she ventured well i got to like em an i liked her an she liked em $ben_weatherstaff$ admitted reluctantly
once or twice a year i go an work at em a bit prune em an dig about th roots they run wild but they was in rich soil so some of em lived
when they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry how can you tell whether they are dead or alive
wait till th spring gets at em wait till th sun shines on th rain and th rain falls on th sunshine an then #tha# ll find out
inquired $mary_lennox$ how how cried $mary_lennox$ forgetting to be careful look along th twigs an branches an if #tha# see a bit of a brown lump swelling here
an there watch it after th warm rain an see what happens he stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face
why does #tha# care so much about roses an such all of a sudden he demanded mistress $mary_lennox$ felt her face grow red
she was almost afraid to answer i i want to play that that i have a #garden# of my own she stammered
i there is nothing for me to do i have nothing and no #one# well said $ben_weatherstaff$ slowly as he watched her that true
#tha# hasnt he said it in such an odd way that $mary_lennox$ wondered if he was actually a little sorry for her
she had never felt sorry for herself she had only felt tired and cross because she disliked people and #thing# so much
but now the #world# seemed to be changing and getting nicer if no #one# found out about the secret #garden# she should enjoy herself always
he answered every #one# of them in his queer grunting way and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up his spade and leave her
he said something about roses just as she was going away and it reminded her of the #one# he had said he had been fond of
she stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as many questions as she dared do you go and see those other roses now
he said it in his grumbling voice and then quite suddenly he seemed to get angry with her though she did not see why he should
she asked not been this year my rheumatics has made me too stiff in th joints now look here he said sharply
dont #tha# ask so many questions #tha# rt th worst wench for askin questions i ve ever come a cross get thee gone an play thee
i ve done talkin for today and he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use in staying another minute
she went skipping slowly down the outside walk thinking him over and saying to herself that queer as it was here was another person whom she liked in spite of his crossness
she liked old $ben_weatherstaff$ yes she did like him she always wanted to try to make him talk to her
there was a laurel hedged walk which curved round the secret #garden# and ended at a gate which opened into a wood in the park
she thought she would slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits hopping about
she enjoyed the skipping very much and when she reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she heard a low peculiar whistling #sound# and wanted to find out what it was
also she began to believe that he knew everything in the #world# about flowers it was a very strange #thing# indeed
she quite caught her breath as she stopped to look at it a boy was sitting under a tree with his back against it playing on a rough wooden pipe
he looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red as poppies and never had mistress $mary_lennox$ seen such round and such blue #eye# in any boy face
and on the trunk of the tree he leaned against a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him and from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peep out and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses and actually it appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little call
when he saw $mary_lennox$ he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost as low as and rather like his piping
he was a funny looking boy about twelve his pipe seemed to make dont #tha# move he said it flight em
he moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were moving at all but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree the pheasant withdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away though not at all as if they were frightened
$mary_lennox$ remained motionless he stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the ground i $dickon$ the boy said
i know #tha# rt miss $mary_lennox$ then $mary_lennox$ realized that somehow she had known at first that he was $dickon$
who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the natives charm snakes in india he had a wide red curving mouth and his smile spread all over his face
i got up slow he explained because if #tha# makes a quick move it startles em a body as to move gentle an speak low when wild #thing# is about
he did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but as if he knew her quite well
$mary_lennox$ knew nothing about boys and she spoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy did you get $martha$ letter
she asked he nodded his curly rust colored head that why i come he stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground beside him when he piped
i ve got th #garden# tools there a little spade an rake an a fork an hoe eh they are good uns
an th woman in th shop threw in a packet white poppy an #one# blue larkspur when i bought th other seeds
there a trowel too will you show the seeds to me $mary_lennox$ said she wished she could talk as he did
it sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would not like him though he was only a common moor boy in patched clothes and with a funny face and a rough rusty red head
as she came closer to him she noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him almost as if he were made of them
she liked it very much and when she looked into his funny face with the red cheeks and round blue #eye# she forgot that she had felt shy
his speech was so quick and easy let us sit down on this log and look at them she said they sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of his coat pocket
he untied the string and inside there were ever so many neater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each #one#
there a lot mignonette an poppies he said mignonette th sweetest smellin #thing# as grows an it ll grow wherever you cast it same as poppies will
them as ll come up an bloom if you just whistle to em them th nicest of all he stopped and turned his head quickly his poppy cheeked face lighting up
where that robin as is callin us he said the chirp came from a thick holly bush bright with scarlet berries and $mary_lennox$ thought she knew whose it was
aye said $dickon$ as if it was the most natural #thing# in the #world# he callin some #one# he friends with
is it really calling us she asked that same as sayin here i am look at me i wants a bit of a chat
there he is in the bush whose is he he $ben_weatherstaff$ but i think he knows me a little answered $mary_lennox$
aye he knows thee said $dickon$ in his low voice again an he likes thee he took thee on
he moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement $mary_lennox$ had noticed before and then he made a #sound# almost like the robin own twitter
he ll tell me all about thee in a minute the robin listened a few seconds intently and then answered quite as if he were replying to a question
aye he a friend yours chuckled $dickon$ do you think he is cried $mary_lennox$ eagerly she did so want to know
do you think he really likes me he wouldnt come near thee if he didnt answered $dickon$ birds is rare choosers an a robin can flout a body worse than a man
see he making up to thee now cannot #tha# see a chap he sayin and it really seemed as if it must be true
he so sidled and twittered and tilted as he hopped on his bush do you understand everything birds say said $mary_lennox$
$dickon$ grin spread until he seemed all wide red curving mouth and he rubbed his rough head i think i do and they think i do he said
i ve lived on th moor with em so long i ve watched em break $shell$ an come out an fledge an learn to fly an begin to sing
sometimes i think raps i a bird or a fox or a rabbit or a squirrel or even a beetle an i dont know it
till i think i #one# of em he laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flower seeds again
he told her what they looked like when they were flowers he told her how to plant them and watch them and feed and water them
see here he said suddenly turning round to look at her i ll plant them for thee myself where is #tha# #garden#
$mary_lennox$ thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap she did not know what to say so for a whole minute she said nothing
she had never thought of this she felt miserable and she felt as if she went red and then pale
#tha# got a bit #garden# hasnt #tha# $dickon$ said it was true that she had turned red and then pale
$dickon$ saw her do it and as she still said nothing he began to be puzzled wouldnt they give thee a bit
he asked hasnt #tha# got any yet she held her hands tighter and turned her #eye# toward him
i dont know anything about boys she said slowly could you keep a secret if i told you #one#
it a great secret i dont know what i should do if any #one# found it out i believe i should die
$dickon$ looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over his rough head again but he answered quite good humoredly
if i couldnt keep secrets from th other lads secrets about foxes cubs an birds nests an wild #thing# holes there be naught safe on th moor
she said the last sentence quite fiercely i keepin secrets all th time he said aye i can keep secrets
mistress $mary_lennox$ did not mean to put out her hand and clutch his sleeve but she did it i ve stolen a #garden# she said very fast
it isnt mine it isnt anybody nobody wants it nobody cares for it nobody ever goes into it perhaps everything is dead in it already
i dont know she began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever felt in her life
i dont care i dont care nobody has any right to take it from me when i care about it and they dont
they re letting it die all shut in by itself she ended passionately and she threw her arms over her face and burst out #crying# poor little mistress $mary_lennox$
$dickon$ curious blue #eye# grew rounder and rounder eh h he said drawing his exclamation out slowly and the way he did it meant both wonder and sympathy
i ve nothing to do said $mary_lennox$ nothing belongs to me i found it myself and i got into it myself
i was only just like the robin and they wouldnt take it from the robin where is it asked $dickon$ in a dropped voice
mistress $mary_lennox$ got up from the log at once she knew she felt contrary again and obstinate and she did not care at all
she was imperious and indian and at the same time hot and sorrowful come with me and i ll show you she said
she led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so thickly $dickon$ followed her with a queer almost pitying look on his face
he felt as if he were being led to look at some strange bird nest and must move softly when she stepped to the wall and lifted the hanging ivy he started
there was a door and $mary_lennox$ pushed it slowly open and they passed in together and then $mary_lennox$ stood and waved her hand round defiantly
it this she said it a secret #garden# and i the only #one# in the #world# who wants it to be alive
$dickon$ looked round and round about it and round and round again eh he almost whispered it is a queer pretty place
for two or three minutes he stood looking round him while $mary_lennox$ watched him and then he began to walk about softly even more lightly than $mary_lennox$ had walked the first time she had found herself inside the four walls
his #eye# seemed to be taking in everything the gray trees with the gray creepers climbing over them and hanging from their branches the tangle on the walls and among the grass the evergreen alcoves with the stone seats and tall flower urns standing in them
it like as if a body was in a dream #chapter# xi the nest of the missel thrush i never thought i see this place he said at last in a whisper
did you know about it asked $mary_lennox$ she had spoken aloud and he made a sign to her we must talk low he said or some #one# ll hear us an wonder what to do in here
oh i forgot said $mary_lennox$ feeling frightened and putting her hand quickly against her mouth did you know about the #garden#
she asked again when she had recovered herself $dickon$ nodded $martha$ told me there was #one# as no #one# ever went inside he answered
us used to wonder what it was like he stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him and his round #eye# looked queerly happy
eh the nests as ll be here come springtime he said it be th safest nestin place in england no #one# never comin near an tangles trees an roses to build in
i wonder all th birds on th moor dont build here mistress $mary_lennox$ put her hand on his arm again without knowing it
will there be roses she whispered can you tell i thought perhaps they were all dead eh
he stepped over to the nearest tree an old old #one# with gray lichen all over its bark but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays and branches
no not them not all of em he answered look here he took a thick knife out of his pocket and opened #one# of its blades
there lots dead wood as ought to be cut out he said an there a lot old wood but it made some new last year
this here a new bit and he touched a shoot which looked brownish green instead of hard dry gray $mary_lennox$ touched it herself in an eager reverent way
that #one# she said is that #one# quite alive quite $dickon$ curved his wide smiling mouth
it as wick as you or me he said and $mary_lennox$ remembered that $martha$ had told her that wick meant alive or lively
i glad it wick she cried out in her whisper i want them all to be wick let us go round the #garden# and count how many wick #one# there are
she quite panted with eagerness and $dickon$ was as eager as she was they went from tree to tree and from bush to bush
$dickon$ carried his knife in his hand and showed her #thing# which she thought wonderful they ve run wild he said but th strongest #one# has fair thrived on it
the delicatest #one# has died out but th others has growed an growed an spread an spread till they a wonder
see here and he pulled down a thick gray dry looking branch a body might think this was dead wood but i dont believe it is down to th root
i ll cut it low down an see he knelt and with his knife cut the lifeless looking branch through not far above the earth
there he said exultantly i told thee so there green in that wood yet look at it $mary_lennox$ was down on her knees before he spoke gazing with all her might
when it looks a bit greenish an juicy like that it wick he explained when th inside is dry an breaks easy like this here piece i ve cut off it done for
an if th old wood cut off an it dug round and took care of there ll be he stopped and lifted his face to look up at the climbing and hanging sprays above him there ll be a fountain roses here this summer
there a big root here as all this live wood sprung out of they went from bush to bush and from tree to tree
he was very strong and clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood away and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green life in it
in the #course# of half an hour $mary_lennox$ thought she could tell too and when he cut through a lifeless looking branch she would cry out joyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade of moist green
he showed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade and stirred the earth and let the air in
they were working industriously round #one# of the biggest standard roses when he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation of surprise
the spade and hoe and fork were very useful why he cried pointing to the grass a few feet away
who did that there it was #one# of $mary_lennox$ own little clearings round the pale green points i did it said $mary_lennox$
i dont she answered but they were so little and the grass was so thick and strong and they looked as if they had no room to breathe
why i thought #tha# didnt know nothin about gardenin he exclaimed so i made a place for them i dont even know what they are
$dickon$ went and knelt down by them smiling his wide smile #tha# was right he said a gardener couldnt have told thee better
they ll grow now like jack bean stalk they re crocuses an snowdrops an these here is narcissuses turning to another patch an here daffydowndillys
eh they will be a sight he ran from #one# clearing to another #tha# has done a lot work for such a little wench he said looking her over
i growing fatter said $mary_lennox$ and i growing stronger i used always to be tired when i dig i not tired at all
i like to smell the earth when it turned up it rare good for thee he said nodding his head wisely
there naught as nice as th smell good clean earth except th smell fresh growin #thing# when th rain falls on em
i get out on th moor many a #day# when it rainin an i lie under a bush an listen to th soft swish drops on th heather
an i just sniff an sniff my nose end fair quivers like a rabbit mother says do you never catch cold
inquired $mary_lennox$ gazing at him wonderingly she had never seen such a funny boy or such a nice #one#
not me he said grinning i never ketched cold since i was born i wasnt brought up nesh enough i ve chased about th moor in all weathers same as th rabbits does
mother says i ve sniffed up too much fresh air for twelve year to ever get to sniffin with cold i as tough as a white thorn knobstick
he was working all the time he was talking and $mary_lennox$ was following him and helping him with her fork or the trowel
there a lot of work to do here he said once looking about quite exultantly will you come again and help me to do it
$mary_lennox$ begged i sure i can help too i can dig and pull up weeds and do whatever you tell me
oh do come $dickon$ i ll come every #day# if #tha# wants me rain or shine he answered stoutly it the best fun i ever had in my life shut in here an wakenin up a #garden#
if you will come said $mary_lennox$ if you will help me to make it alive i ll i dont know what i ll do she ended helplessly
what could you do for a boy like that i ll tell thee what #tha# ll do said $dickon$ with his happy grin
#tha# ll get fat an #tha# ll get as hungry as a young fox an #tha# ll learn how to talk to th robin same as i do
eh we ll have a lot fun he began to walk about looking up in the trees and at the walls and bushes with a thoughtful #expression#
i wouldnt want to make it look like a gardener #garden# all clipped an spick an span would you he said
it nicer like this with #thing# runnin wild an swingin an catchin hold of each other dont let us make it tidy said $mary_lennox$ anxiously
it wouldnt seem like a secret #garden# if it was tidy $dickon$ stood rubbing his rusty red head with a rather puzzled look
it a secret #garden# sure enough he said but seems like some #one# besides th robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year ago
but the door was locked and the key was buried said $mary_lennox$ no #one# could get in
that true he answered it a queer place seems to me as if there been a bit prunin done here an there later than ten year ago
but how could it have been done said $mary_lennox$ he was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook his head
mistress $mary_lennox$ always felt that however many years she lived she should never forget that first morning when her #garden# began to grow
aye how could it he murmured with th door locked an th key buried of #course# it did seem to begin to grow for her that morning
when $dickon$ began to clear places to plant seeds she remembered what basil had sung at her when he wanted to tease her
are there any flowers that look like bells she inquired lilies th valley does he answered digging away with the trowel an there canterbury bells an campanulas
let plant some said $mary_lennox$ there lilies th valley here already i saw em they ll have growed too close an we ll have to separate em but there plenty
th other #one# takes two years to bloom from seed but i can bring you some bits plants from our cottage #garden#
then $mary_lennox$ told him about basil and his brothers and #sister# in india and of how she had hated them and of their calling her mistress $mary_lennox$ quite contrary
why does #tha# want em they used to dance round and sing at me they sang mistress $mary_lennox$ quite contrary
how does your #garden# grow with silver bells and cockle shells and marigolds all in a row i just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowers like silver bells
she frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather spiteful dig into the earth i wasnt as contrary as they were
he said and as he crumbled the rich black soil she saw he was sniffing up the scent of it
there doesnt seem to be no need for no #one# to be contrary when there flowers an such like an such lots friendly wild #thing# runnin about makin homes for themselves or buildin nests an singin an whistlin does there
but $dickon$ laughed eh $mary_lennox$ kneeling by him holding the seeds looked at him and stopped frowning
$dickon$ she said you are as nice as $martha$ said you were i like you and you make the fifth person
i never thought i should like five people $dickon$ sat up on his heels as $martha$ did when she was polishing the grate
he did look funny and delightful $mary_lennox$ thought with his round blue #eye# and red cheeks and happy looking turned up nose
only five folk as #tha# likes he said who is th other four your mother and $martha$ $mary_lennox$ checked them off on her fingers and the robin and $ben_weatherstaff$
$dickon$ laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the #sound# by putting his arm over his mouth i know #tha# thinks i a queer lad he said
but i think #tha# art th queerest little lass i ever saw then $mary_lennox$ did a strange #thing# she leaned forward and asked him a question she had never dreamed of asking any #one# before
and she tried to ask it in $yorkshire$ because that was his language and in india a native was always pleased if you knew his speech
does #tha# like me she said eh he answered heartily that i does i likes thee wonderful an so does th robin i do believe
that two then said $mary_lennox$ that two for me and then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully
$mary_lennox$ was startled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard strike the hour of her midday dinner
i shall have to go she said mournfully and you will have to go too wont you $dickon$ grinned
my dinner easy to carry about with me he said mother always lets me put a bit somethin in my pocket
he picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a lumpy little bundle tied up in a quite clean coarse blue and white handkerchief
it held two thick pieces of bread with a slice of something laid between them it oftenest naught but bread he said but
i ve got a fine slice fat bacon with it today $mary_lennox$ thought it looked a queer dinner but he seemed ready to enjoy it
run on an get thy victuals he said i ll be done with mine first i ll get some more work done before i start back home
he sat down with his back against a tree i ll call th robin up he said and give him th rind th bacon to peck at
suddenly it seemed as if he might be a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the #garden# again
they likes a bit fat wonderful $mary_lennox$ could scarcely bear to leave him he seemed too good to be true
she went slowly half way to the door in the wall and then she stopped and went back whatever happens you you never would tell
she said his poppy colored cheeks were distended with his first big bite of bread and bacon but he managed to smile encouragingly
if #tha# was a missel thrush an showed me where thy nest was does #tha# think i tell any #one#
not me he said #tha# art as safe as a missel thrush and she was quite sure she was
#chapter# xii might i have a bit of earth $mary_lennox$ ran so fast that she was rather out of breath when she reached her room
her hair was ruffled on her forehead and her cheeks were bright pink her dinner was waiting on the table and $martha$ was waiting near it
#tha# a bit late she said where has #tha# been i ve seen $dickon$ said $mary_lennox$ i ve seen $dickon$
i knew he come said $martha$ exultantly how does #tha# like him i think i think he beautiful said $mary_lennox$ in a determined voice
$martha$ looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased too well she said he th best lad as ever was born but us never thought he was handsome
his nose turns up too much i like it to turn up said $mary_lennox$ an his #eye# is so round said $martha$ a trifle doubtful
though they re a nice #color# i like them round said $mary_lennox$ and they are exactly the #color# of the sky over the moor
$martha$ beamed with satisfaction mother says he made em that #color# with always lookin up at th birds an th clouds
but he has got a big mouth hasnt he now i love his big mouth said $mary_lennox$ obstinately i wish mine were just like it
$martha$ chuckled delightedly it look rare an funny in thy bit of a face she said but i knowed it would be that way when #tha# saw him
how did #tha# like th seeds an th #garden# tools how did you know he brought them asked $mary_lennox$
eh i never thought of him not bringin em he be sure to bring em if they was in $yorkshire$
he such a trusty lad $mary_lennox$ was afraid that she might begin to ask difficult questions but she did not
she was very much interested in the seeds and gardening tools and there was only #one# moment when $mary_lennox$ was frightened
this was when she began to ask where the flowers were to be planted who did #tha# ask about it
she inquired i havent asked anybody yet said $mary_lennox$ hesitating well i wouldnt ask th head gardener he too grand $mr_roach$ is
i ve never seen him said $mary_lennox$ i ve only seen undergardeners and $ben_weatherstaff$ if i was you i ask $ben_weatherstaff$ advised $martha$
$mr_archibald_craven$ lets him do what he likes because he was here when mrs $mr_archibald_craven$ was alive an he used to make her laugh
he not half as bad as he looks for all he so crabbed she liked him perhaps he find you a corner somewhere out
if it was out of the way and no #one# wanted it no #one# could mind my having it could they
o the way $mary_lennox$ said anxiously there wouldnt be no reason answered $martha$ you wouldnt do no harm
$mary_lennox$ ate her dinner as quickly as she could and when she rose from the table she was going to run to her room to put on her hat again but $martha$ stopped her
i ve got somethin to tell you she said i thought i let you eat your dinner first $mr_archibald_craven$ came back this mornin and i think he wants to see you
$mary_lennox$ turned quite pale oh she said why why he didnt want to see me when i came
i heard pitcher say he didnt well explained $martha$ $mrs_medlock$ says it because mother she was walkin to thwaite village
an she met him she never spoke to him before but mrs $mr_archibald_craven$ had been to our cottage two or three times
he forgot but mother hadnt an she made bold to stop him i dont know what she said to him about you
but she said somethin as put him in th mind to see you before he goes away again tomorrow oh cried $mary_lennox$ is he going away tomorrow
i am so glad he goin for a long time he maynt come back till autumn or winter he goin to travel in foreign places
if he did not come back until winter or even autumn there would be time to watch the secret #garden# come alive
he always doin it oh i so glad so glad said $mary_lennox$ thankfully even if he found out then and took it away from her she would have had that much at least
when do you think he will want to see she did not finish the sentence because the door opened and $mrs_medlock$ walked in
she had on her best black dress and cap and her collar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a man face on it
it was a colored photograph of mr $mrs_medlock$ who had died years ago and she always wore it when she was dressed up
she looked nervous and excited your hair rough she said quickly go and brush it $martha$ help her to slip on her best dress
$mr_archibald_craven$ sent me to bring her to him in his study all the pink left $mary_lennox$ cheeks her heart began to thump and she felt herself changing into a stiff plain silent child again
she said nothing while her dress was changed and her hair brushed and after she was quite tidy she followed $mrs_medlock$ down the corridors in silence
she did not even answer $mrs_medlock$ but turned and walked into her bedroom followed by $martha$ what was there for her to say
she was obliged to go and see $mr_archibald_craven$ and he would not like her and she would not like him
she knew what he would think of her she was taken to a part of the house she had not been into before
at last $mrs_medlock$ knocked at a door and when some #one# said come in they entered the room together a man was sitting in an armchair before the fire and $mrs_medlock$ spoke to him
this is miss $mary_lennox$ sir she said you can go and leave her here i will ring for you when i want you to take her away said $mr_archibald_craven$
when she went out and closed the door $mary_lennox$ could only stand waiting a plain little #thing# twisting her thin hands together
she could see that the man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high rather crooked shoulders and he had black hair streaked with white
he turned his head over his high shoulders and spoke to her come here he said $mary_lennox$ went to him he was not ugly
he looked as if the sight of her worried and fretted him and as if he did not know what in the #world# to do with her
his face would have been handsome if it had not been so miserable are you well he asked
yes answered $mary_lennox$ do they take good care of you yes he rubbed his forehead fretfully as he looked her over
you are very thin he said i am getting fatter $mary_lennox$ answered in what she knew was her stiffest way
his black #eye# seemed as if they scarcely saw her as if they were seeing something else and he could hardly keep his thoughts upon her
what an unhappy face he had i forgot you he said how could i remember you i intended to send you a governess or a nurse or some #one# of that sort but i forgot
please began $mary_lennox$ please and then the lump in her throat choked her what do you want to say
he inquired i am i am too big for a nurse said $mary_lennox$ and please please dont make me have a governess yet
he rubbed his forehead again and stared at her that was what the $susan_sowerby$ woman said he muttered absentmindedly
then $mary_lennox$ gathered a scrap of courage is she is she $martha$ mother she stammered yes i think so he replied
she knows about children said $mary_lennox$ she has twelve she knows he seemed to rouse himself what do you want to do
i want to play out of doors $mary_lennox$ answered hoping that her voice did not tremble i never liked it in india
it makes me hungry here and i am getting fatter he was watching her mrs $susan_sowerby$ said it would do you good
perhaps it will he said she thought you had better get stronger before you had a governess it makes me feel strong when i play and the wind comes over the moor argued $mary_lennox$
where do you play he asked next everywhere gasped $mary_lennox$ $martha$ mother sent me a skipping rope i skip and run and i look about to see if #thing# are beginning to stick up out of the earth
i dont do any harm dont look so frightened he said in a worried voice you could not do any harm a child like you
$mary_lennox$ put her hand up to her throat because she was afraid he might see the excited lump which she felt jump into it
you may do what you like she came a step nearer to him may i she said tremulously
her anxious little face seemed to worry him more than ever dont look so frightened he exclaimed of #course# you may
i am your guardian though i am a poor #one# for any child i cannot give you time or attention i am too ill and wretched and distracted but i wish you to be happy and comfortable
i dont know anything about children but $mrs_medlock$ is to see that you have all you need i sent for you to #day# because mrs $susan_sowerby$ said i ought to see you
her daughter had talked about you she thought you needed fresh air and freedom and running about she knows all about children $mary_lennox$ said again in spite of herself
she ought to said $mr_archibald_craven$ i thought her rather bold to stop me on the moor but she said mrs
$mr_archibald_craven$ had been kind to her it seemed hard for him to speak his dead wife name she is a respectable woman
now i have seen you i think she said sensible #thing# play out of doors as much as you like it a big place and you may go where you like and amuse yourself as you like
is there anything you want as if a sudden thought had struck him do you want toys books dolls
in her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words would #sound# and that they were not the #one# she had meant to say
might i quavered $mary_lennox$ might i have a bit of earth $mr_archibald_craven$ looked quite startled earth he repeated
what do you mean to plant seeds in to make #thing# grow to see them come alive $mary_lennox$ faltered he gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly over his #eye#
do you care about #garden# so much he said slowly i didnt know about them in india said $mary_lennox$
i was always ill and tired and it was too hot i sometimes made little beds in the sand and stuck flowers in them
but here it is different $mr_archibald_craven$ got up and began to walk slowly across the room a bit of earth he said to himself and $mary_lennox$ thought that somehow she must have reminded him of something
when he stopped and spoke to her his dark #eye# looked almost soft and kind you can have as much earth as you want he said
when you see a bit of earth you want with something like a smile take it child and make it come alive
you remind me of some #one# else who loved the earth and #thing# that grow may i take it from anywhere if it not wanted
anywhere he answered there you must go now i am tired he touched the bell to call $mrs_medlock$
good by i shall be away all summer $mrs_medlock$ came so quickly that $mary_lennox$ thought she must have been waiting in the corridor
$mrs_medlock$ $mr_archibald_craven$ said to her now i have seen the child i understand what mrs $susan_sowerby$ meant she must be less delicate before she begins lessons
give her simple healthy food let her run wild in the #garden# dont look after her too much she needs liberty and fresh air and romping about
mrs $susan_sowerby$ is to come and see her now and then and she may sometimes go to the cottage $mrs_medlock$ looked pleased
she was relieved to hear that she need not look after $mary_lennox$ too much she had felt her a tiresome charge and had indeed seen as little of her as she dared
in addition to this she was fond of $martha$ mother thank you sir she said $susan_sowerby$ and me went to school together
and she as sensible and good hearted a woman as you find in a #day# walk i never had any children myself
and she had twelve and there never was healthier or better #one# miss $mary_lennox$ can get no harm from them i always take $susan_sowerby$ advice about children myself
she what you might call healthy minded if you understand me i understand $mr_archibald_craven$ answered take miss $mary_lennox$ away now and send pitcher to me
when $mrs_medlock$ left her at the end of her own corridor $mary_lennox$ flew back to her room she found $martha$ waiting there
$martha$ had in fact hurried back after she had removed the dinner service i can have my #garden# cried $mary_lennox$
i may have it where i like i am not going to have a governess for a long time your mother is coming to see me
and i may go to your cottage he says a little girl like me could not do any harm and i may do what i like anywhere
$martha$ said $mary_lennox$ solemnly he is really a nice man only his face is so miserable and his forehead is all drawn together
eh said $martha$ delightedly that was nice of him wasnt it she ran as quickly as she could to the #garden#
she had been away so much longer than she had thought she should and she knew $dickon$ would have to set out early on his five mile walk
when she slipped through the door under the ivy she saw he was not working where she had left him the gardening tools were laid together under a tree
he had gone away and the secret #garden# was empty except for the robin who had just flown across the wall and sat on a standard rose bush watching her
she ran to them looking all round the place but there was no $dickon$ to be seen he gone she said woefully
it was a piece of paper in fact it was a piece of the letter she had printed for $martha$ to send to $dickon$
it was fastened on the bush with a long thorn and in a minute she knew $dickon$ had left it there
oh was he was he was he only a wood fairy something white fastened to the standard rose bush caught her #eye# there were some roughly printed letters on it and a sort of picture
at first she could not tell what it was then she saw it was meant for a nest with a bird sitting on it
underneath were the printed letters and they said i will cum bak #chapter# xiii i am $mester_colin$ $mary_lennox$ took the picture back to the house when she went to her supper and she showed it to $martha$
eh said $martha$ with great pride i never knew our $dickon$ was as clever as that that there a picture of a missel thrush on her nest as large as life an twice as natural
then $mary_lennox$ knew $dickon$ had meant the picture to be a message he had meant that she might be sure he would keep her secret
her #garden# was her nest and she was like a missel thrush oh how she did like that queer common boy
she hoped he would come back the very next #day# and she fell asleep looking forward to the morning but you never know what the weather will do in $yorkshire$ particularly in the springtime
it was pouring down in torrents and the wind was wuthering round the corners and in the chimneys of the huge old house
she was awakened in the night by the #sound# of rain beating with heavy drops against her window $mary_lennox$ sat up in bed and felt miserable and angry
the rain is as contrary as i ever was she said it came because it knew i did not want it
she did not cry but she lay and hated the #sound# of the heavily beating rain she hated the wind and its wuthering
she threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face she could not go to sleep again the mournful #sound# kept her awake because she felt mournful herself
if she had felt happy it would probably have lulled her to sleep how it wuthered and how the big raindrops poured down and beat against the pane
she had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour when suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head toward the door listening
it #sound# just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on #crying# she said she listened and she listened
it isnt the wind now she said in a loud whisper that isnt the wind it is different it is that #crying# i heard before
the door of her room was ajar and the #sound# came down the corridor a far off faint #sound# of fretful #crying#
she listened for a few minutes and each minute she became more and more sure she felt as if she must find out what it was
it seemed even stranger than the secret #garden# and the buried key perhaps the fact that she was in a rebellious mood made her bold
she put her foot out of bed and stood on the floor i am going to find out what it is she said
everybody is in bed and i dont care about $mrs_medlock$ i dont care there was a candle by her bedside and she took it up and went softly out of the room
she thought she remembered the corners she must turn to find the short corridor with the door covered with tapestry the #one# $mrs_medlock$ had come through the #day# she lost herself
the corridor looked very long and dark but she was too excited to mind that the #sound# had come up that passage
so she went on with her dim light almost feeling her way her heart beating so loud that she fancied she could hear it
the far off faint #crying# went on and led her sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again
was this the right corner to turn she stopped and thought yes it was down this passage and then to the left and then up two broad steps and then to the right again
she pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her and she stood in the corridor and could hear the #crying# quite plainly though it was not loud
it was on the other side of the wall at her left and a few yards farther on there was a door
yes there was the tapestry door she could see a glimmer of light coming from beneath it the someone was #crying# in that room and it was quite a young someone
so she walked to the door and pushed it open and there she was standing in the room it was a big room with ancient handsome furniture in it
there was a low fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by the side of a carved four posted bed hung with brocade and on the bed was lying a boy #crying# fretfully
$mary_lennox$ wondered if she was in a real place or if she had fallen asleep again and was dreaming without knowing it
the boy had a sharp delicate face the #color# of ivory and he seemed to have #eye# too big for it
he had also a lot of hair which tumbled over his forehead in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller
he looked like a boy who had been ill but he was #crying# more as if he were tired and cross than as if he were in pain
then she crept across the room and as she drew nearer the light attracted the boy attention and he turned his head on his pillow and stared at her his gray #eye# opening so wide that they seemed immense
$mary_lennox$ stood near the door with her candle in her hand holding her breath who are you he said at last in a half frightened whisper
are you a ghost no i am not $mary_lennox$ answered her own whisper sounding half frightened are you #one#
he stared and stared and stared $mary_lennox$ could not help noticing what strange #eye# he had they were agate gray and they looked too big for his face because they had black lashes all round them
no he replied after waiting a moment or so i am $mester_colin$ who is $mester_colin$ she faltered
i am $mester_colin$ $mr_archibald_craven$ who are you i am $mary_lennox$ $mr_archibald_craven$ is my uncle he is my father said the boy
your father gasped $mary_lennox$ no #one# ever told me he had a boy why didnt they come here he said still keeping his strange #eye# fixed on her with an anxious #expression#
she came close to the bed and he put out his hand and touched her you are real arent you
he said i have such real dreams very often you might be #one# of them $mary_lennox$ had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she left her room
and she put a piece of it between his fingers rub that and see how thick and warm it is she said
i will pinch you a little if you like to show you how real i am for a minute i thought you might be a dream too
where did you come from he asked from my own room the wind wuthered so i couldnt go to sleep
and i heard some #one# #crying# and wanted to find out who it was what were you #crying# for
because i couldnt go to sleep either and my head ached tell me your name again $mary_lennox$ did no #one# ever tell you i had come to live here
he was still fingering the fold of her wrapper but he began to look a little more as if he believed in her reality
no he answered they darent why asked $mary_lennox$ because i should have been afraid you would see me
i wont let people see me and talk me over why $mary_lennox$ asked again feeling more mystified every moment because i am like this always ill and having to lie down
my father wont let people talk me over either the servants are not allowed to speak about me if i live i may be a hunchback but i shant live
my father hates to think i may be like him oh what a queer house this is $mary_lennox$ said
what a queer house everything is a kind of secret rooms are locked up and #garden# are locked up and you have you been locked up
no i stay in this room because i dont want to be moved out of it it tires me too much
does your father come and see you $mary_lennox$ ventured sometimes generally when i am asleep he doesnt want to see me
why $mary_lennox$ could not help asking again a sort of angry shadow passed over the boy face my mother died when i was born and it makes him wretched to look at me
he thinks i dont know but i ve heard people talking he almost hates me he hates the #garden# because she died said $mary_lennox$ half speaking to herself
what #garden# the boy asked oh just just a #garden# she used to like $mary_lennox$ stammered have you been here always
nearly always sometimes i have been taken to places at the seaside but i wont stay because people stare at me
i used to wear an iron #thing# to keep my back straight but a grand doctor came from london to see me and said it was stupid
he told them to take it off and keep me out in the fresh air i hate fresh air and i dont want to go out
i didnt when first i came here said $mary_lennox$ why do you keep looking at me like that
because of the dreams that are so real he answered rather fretfully sometimes when i open my #eye# i dont believe i awake
we re both awake said $mary_lennox$ she glanced round the room with its high ceiling and shadowy corners and dim fire light
it looks quite like a dream and it the middle of the night and everybody in the house is asleep everybody but us
we are wide awake i dont want it to be a dream the boy said restlessly $mary_lennox$ thought of something all at once
if you dont like people to see you she began do you want me to go away he still held the fold of her wrapper and he gave it a little pull
no he said i should be sure you were a dream if you went if you are real sit down on that big footstool and talk
i want to hear about you $mary_lennox$ put down her candle on the table near the bed and sat down on the cushioned stool
she did not want to go away at all she wanted to stay in the mysterious hidden away room and talk to the mysterious boy
he wanted to know how long she had been at misselthwaite he wanted to know which corridor her room was on he wanted to know what she had been doing if she disliked the moor as he disliked it where she had lived before she came to $yorkshire$
what do you want me to tell you she said she answered all these questions and many more and he lay back on his pillow and listened
he made her tell him a great deal about india and about her voyage across the ocean she found out that because he had been an invalid he had not learned #thing# as other children had
#one# of his nurses had taught him to read when he was quite little and he was always reading and looking at pictures in splendid books
though his father rarely saw him when he was awake he was given all sorts of wonderful #thing# to amuse himself with
he never seemed to have been amused however he could have anything he asked for and was never made to do anything he did not like to do
everyone is obliged to do what pleases me he said indifferently it makes me ill to be angry no #one# believes i shall live to grow up
he said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased to matter to him at all
he seemed to like the #sound# of $mary_lennox$ voice as she went on talking he listened in a drowsy interested way
once or twice she wondered if he were not gradually falling into a doze but at last he asked a question which opened up a new subject
how old are you he asked i am ten answered $mary_lennox$ forgetting herself for the moment and so are you
how do you know that he demanded in a surprised voice because when you were born the #garden# door was locked and the key was buried
and it has been locked for ten years $mester_colin$ half sat up turning toward her leaning on his elbows
what #garden# door was locked who did it where was the key buried he exclaimed as if he were suddenly very much interested
it it was the #garden# $mr_archibald_craven$ hates said $mary_lennox$ nervously he locked the door no #one# no #one# knew where he buried the key
what sort of a #garden# is it $mester_colin$ persisted eagerly no #one# has been allowed to go into it for ten years was $mary_lennox$ careful answer
he too had had nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden #garden# attracted him as it had attracted her
but it was too late to be careful he was too much like herself he asked question after question where was it
had she never looked for the door had she never asked the gardeners they wont talk about it said $mary_lennox$
i think they have been told not to answer questions i would make them said $mester_colin$ could you
$mary_lennox$ faltered beginning to feel frightened if he could make people answer questions who knew what might happen everyone is obliged to please me
i told you that he said if i were to live this place would sometime belong to me they all know that
$mary_lennox$ had not known that she herself had been spoiled but she could see quite plainly that this mysterious boy had been
i would make them tell me he thought that the whole #world# belonged to him how peculiar he was and how coolly he spoke of not living
do you think you wont live she asked partly because she was curious and partly in hope of making him forget the #garden#
i dont suppose i shall he answered as indifferently as he had spoken before ever since i remember anything i have heard people say i shant
at first they thought i was too little to understand and now they think i dont hear but i do my doctor is my father cousin
he is quite poor and if i die he will have all misselthwaite when my father is dead i should think he wouldnt want me to live
do you want to live inquired $mary_lennox$ no he answered in a cross tired fashion but i dont want to die
when i feel ill i lie here and think about it until i cry and cry i have heard you #crying# three times $mary_lennox$ said but i did not know who it was
were you #crying# about that she did so want him to forget the #garden# i dare say he answered
let us talk about something else talk about that #garden# dont you want to see it yes answered $mary_lennox$ in quite a low voice
i do he went on persistently i dont think i ever really wanted to see anything before but i want to see that #garden#
i want the key dug up i want the door unlocked i would let them take me there in my chair
that would be getting fresh air i am going to make them open the door he had become quite excited and his strange #eye# began to shine like stars and looked more immense than ever
they have to please me he said i will make them take me there and i will let you go too
$mary_lennox$ hands clutched each other everything would be spoiled everything $dickon$ would never come back she would never again feel like a missel thrush with a safe hidden nest
oh dont dont dont dont do that she cried out he stared as if he thought she had gone crazy why he exclaimed
i do she answered almost with a sob in her throat but if you make them open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secret again
you said you wanted to see it he leaned still farther forward a secret he said
what do you mean tell me $mary_lennox$ words almost tumbled over #one# another you see you see she panted if no #one# knows but
ourselves if there was a door hidden somewhere under the ivy if there was and we could find it and if we could slip through it together and shut it behind us and no #one# knew any #one# was inside and we called it our #garden# and pretended that that we were missel thrushes and it was our nest and if we played there almost every #day# and dug and planted seeds and made it all come alive
is it dead he interrupted her it soon will be if no #one# cares for it she went on
the bulbs will live but the roses he stopped her again as excited as she was herself what are bulbs
he put in quickly they are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops they are working in the earth now pushing up pale green points because the spring is coming
is the spring coming he said what is it like you dont see it in rooms if you are ill
it is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the sunshine and #thing# pushing up and working under the earth said $mary_lennox$
if the #garden# was a secret and we could get into it we could watch the #thing# grow bigger every #day# and see how many roses are alive
dont you see oh dont you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret he dropped back on his pillow and lay there with an odd #expression# on his face
i never had a secret he said except that #one# about not living to grow up they dont know i know that so it is a sort of secret
if you wont make them take you to the #garden# pleaded $mary_lennox$ perhaps i feel almost sure i can find out how to get in sometime
and then if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair and if you can always do what you want to do perhaps perhaps we might find some boy who would push you and we could go alone and it would always be a secret #garden#
but i like this kind better i should like that he said very slowly his #eye# looking dreamy i should like that
i should not mind fresh air in a secret #garden# $mary_lennox$ began to recover her breath and feel safer because the idea of keeping the secret seemed to please him
she felt almost sure that if she kept on talking and could make him see the #garden# in his mind as she had seen it he would like it so much that he could not bear to think that everybody might tramp in to it when they chose
i ll tell you what i think it would be like if we could go into it she said it has been shut up so long #thing# have grown into a tangle perhaps
he lay quite still and listened while she went on talking about the roses which might have clambered from tree to tree and hung down about the many birds which might have built their nests there because it was so safe
and then she told him about the robin and $ben_weatherstaff$ and there was so much to tell about the robin
the robin pleased him so much that he smiled until he looked almost beautiful and at first $mary_lennox$ had thought that he was even plainer than herself with his big #eye# and heavy locks of hair
and it was so easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to be afraid i did not know birds could be like that he said
but if you stay in a room you never see #thing# what a lot of #thing# you know i feel as if you had been inside that #garden#
she did not know what to say so she did not say anything he evidently did not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a surprise
i am going to let you look at something he said do you see that rose colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel piece
$mary_lennox$ had not noticed it before but she looked up and saw it it was a curtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture
yes she answered there is a cord hanging from it said $mester_colin$ go and pull it $mary_lennox$ got up much mystified and found the cord
when she pulled it the silk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a picture it was the picture of a girl with a laughing face
she had bright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay lovely #eye# were exactly like $mester_colin$ unhappy #one# agate gray and looking twice as big as they really were because of the black lashes all round them
she is my mother said $mester_colin$ complainingly i dont see why she died sometimes i hate her for doing it
how queer said $mary_lennox$ if she had lived i believe i should not have been ill always he grumbled
i dare say i should have lived too and my father would not have hated to look at me i dare say i should have had a strong back
she is much prettier than you she said but her #eye# are just like yours at least they are the same shape and #color#
draw the curtain again $mary_lennox$ did as she was told and returned to her footstool why is the curtain drawn over her
he moved uncomfortably i made them do it he said sometimes i dont like to see her looking at me
she smiles too much when i am ill and miserable besides she is mine and i dont want everyone to see her
there were a few moments of silence and then $mary_lennox$ spoke what would $mrs_medlock$ do if she found out that i had been here
she inquired she would do as i told her to do he answered and i should tell her that i wanted you to come here and talk to me every #day#
i am glad you came so am i said $mary_lennox$ i will come as often as i can but she hesitated i shall have to look every #day# for the #garden# door
yes you must said $mester_colin$ and you can tell me about it afterward he lay thinking a few minutes as he had done before and then he spoke again
i think you shall be a secret too he said i will not tell them until they find out
i can always send the nurse out of the room and say that i want to be by myself do you know $martha$
yes i know her very well said $mary_lennox$ she waits on me he nodded his head toward the outer corridor
the nurse went away yesterday to stay all night with her #sister# and she always makes $martha$ attend to me when she wants to go out
she is the #one# who is asleep in the other room $martha$ shall tell you when to come here
then $mary_lennox$ understood $martha$ troubled look when she had asked questions about the #crying# $martha$ knew about you all the time
she said yes she often attends to me the nurse likes to get away from me and then $martha$ comes
i have been here a long time said $mary_lennox$ shall i go away now your #eye# look sleepy
shut your #eye# said $mary_lennox$ drawing her footstool closer and i will do what my ayah used to do in india
i wish i could go to sleep before you leave me he said rather shyly i will pat your hand and stroke it and sing something quite low
somehow she was sorry for him and did not want him to lie awake so she leaned against the bed and began to stroke and pat his hand and sing a very low little chanting song in hindustani
that is nice he said more drowsily still and she went on chanting and stroking but when she looked at him again his black lashes were lying close against his cheeks for his #eye# were shut
i should like that perhaps he said drowsily and he was fast asleep so she got up softly took her candle and crept away without making a #sound#
#chapter# xiv a young $rajah$ the moor was hidden in mist when the morning came and the rain had not stopped pouring down
$martha$ was so busy that $mary_lennox$ had no opportunity of talking to her but in the afternoon she asked her to come and sit with her in the nursery
there could be no going out of doors she came bringing the stocking she was always knitting when she was doing nothing else
what the matter with thee she asked as soon as they sat down #tha# looks as if #tha# somethin to say
i have i have found out what the #crying# was said $mary_lennox$ $martha$ let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed at her with startled #eye#
#tha# hasnt she exclaimed never i heard it in the night $mary_lennox$ went on and i got up and went to see where it came from
it was $mester_colin$ i found him $martha$ face became red with fright eh miss $mary_lennox$ she said half #crying#
#tha# shouldnt have done it #tha# shouldnt #tha# ll get me in trouble i never told thee nothin about him but #tha# ll get me in trouble
i shall lose my place and what ll mother do you wont lose your place said $mary_lennox$ he was glad i came
we talked and talked and he said he was glad i came was he cried $martha$ art #tha# sure
he a big lad to cry like a #baby# but when he in a passion he ll fair scream just to frighten us
#tha# doesnt know what he like when anything vexes him he knows us darent call our souls our own he wasnt vexed said $mary_lennox$
he asked me questions and i sat on a big footstool and talked to him about india and about the robin and #garden#
i asked him if i should go away and he made me stay he wouldnt let me go he let me see his mother picture
before i left him i sang him to sleep $martha$ fairly gasped with amazement i can scarcely believe thee
if he been like he is most times he have throwed himself into #one# of his tantrums and roused th house
she protested it as if #tha# walked straight into a lion den he wont let strangers look at him
he let me look at him i looked at him all the time and he looked at me we stared said $mary_lennox$
i dont know what to do cried agitated $martha$ if $mrs_medlock$ finds out she ll think i broke orders and told thee
and i shall be packed back to mother he is not going to tell $mrs_medlock$ anything about it yet
it to be a sort of secret just at first said $mary_lennox$ firmly and he says everybody is obliged to do as he pleases
aye that true enough th bad lad sighed $martha$ wiping her forehead with her apron he says $mrs_medlock$ must
and he wants me to come and talk to him every #day# and you are to tell me when he wants me
you cant if you are doing what he wants you to do and everybody is ordered to obey him $mary_lennox$ argued
me said $martha$ i shall lose my place i shall for sure does #tha# mean to say cried $martha$ with wide open #eye# that he was nice to thee
i think he almost liked me $mary_lennox$ answered then #tha# must have bewitched him decided $martha$ drawing a long breath
do you mean $magic$ inquired $mary_lennox$ i ve heard about $magic$ in india but i cant make it i just went into his room
and i was so surprised to see him i stood and stared and then he turned round and stared at me
and it was so queer being there alone together in the middle of the night and not knowing about each other
and he thought i was a ghost or a dream and i thought perhaps he was and we began to ask each other questions
and when i asked him if i must go away he said i must not th #world# comin to a end
gasped $martha$ what is the matter with him asked $mary_lennox$ nobody knows for sure and certain said $martha$
$mr_archibald_craven$ went off his head like when he was born th doctors thought he have to be put in a sylum
it was because mrs $mr_archibald_craven$ died like i told you he wouldnt set #eye# on th #baby# he just raved and said it be another hunchback like him
and it better die is $mester_colin$ a hunchback $mary_lennox$ asked he didnt look like #one# he isnt yet said $martha$
but he began all wrong mother said that there was enough trouble and raging in th house to set any child wrong
they was afraid his back was weak an they ve always been takin care of it keepin him lyin down and not lettin him walk
once they made him wear a brace but he fretted so he was downright ill then a big doctor came to see him an made them take it off
he talked to th other doctor quite rough in a polite way he said there been too much medicine and too much lettin
him have his own way i think he a very spoiled boy said $mary_lennox$ he th worst young nowt as ever was said $martha$
i wont say as he hasnt been ill a good bit he had coughs an colds that nearly killed him two or three times
once he had rheumatic fever an once he had typhoid eh $mrs_medlock$ did get a fright then he been out of his head an she was talkin to th nurse thinkin
he didnt know nothin an she said he ll die this time sure enough an best #thing# for him an for everybody
an she looked at him an there he was with his big #eye# open starin at her as sensible as she was herself
she didnt know wha happen but he just stared at her an says you give me some water an stop talkin
do you think he will die asked $mary_lennox$ mother says there no reason why any child should live that gets no fresh air
he weak and hates th trouble bein taken out doors an he gets cold so easy he says it makes him ill
an doesnt do nothin but lie on his back an read picture books an take medicine $mary_lennox$ sat and looked at the fire
i wonder she said slowly if it would not do him good to go out into a #garden# and watch #thing# growing
#one# of th worst fits he ever had said $martha$ was #one# time they took him out where the roses is by the fountain
rose cold an he began to sneeze an said he got it an then a new gardener as didnt know th rules passed by an looked at him curious
he threw himself into a passion an he said he looked at him because he was going to be a hunchback
it did me good he been readin in a paper about people gettin somethin he called he cried himself into a fever an was ill all night
if he ever gets angry at me i ll never go and see him again said $mary_lennox$ he ll have thee if he wants thee said $martha$
#tha# may as well know that at th start very soon afterward a bell rang and she rolled up her knitting
i dare say th nurse wants me to stay with him a bit she said i hope he in a good temper
she was out of the room about ten minutes and then she came back with a puzzled #expression# well #tha# has bewitched him she said
he up on his sofa with his picture books he told the nurse to stay away until six clock i to wait in the next room
th minute she was gone he called me to him an says i want $mary_lennox$ to come and talk to me and remember you re not to tell any #one#
she did not want to see $mester_colin$ as much as she wanted to see $dickon$ but she wanted to see him very much
there was a bright fire on the hearth when she entered his room and in the daylight she saw it was a very beautiful room indeed
there were rich #color# in the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on the walls which made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite of the gray sky and falling rain
you better go as quick as you can $mary_lennox$ was quite willing to go quickly $mester_colin$ looked rather like a picture himself
he was wrapped in a velvet dressing gown and sat against a big brocaded cushion he had a red spot on each cheek
come in he said i ve been thinking about you all morning i ve been thinking about you too answered $mary_lennox$
you dont know how frightened $martha$ is she says $mrs_medlock$ will think she told me about you and then she will be sent away
he frowned go and tell her to come here he said she is in the next room $mary_lennox$ went and brought her back
poor $martha$ was shaking in her shoes $mester_colin$ was still frowning have you to do what i please or have you not
he demanded i have to do what you please sir $martha$ faltered turning quite red has $mrs_medlock$ to do what i please
well then if i order you to bring miss $mary_lennox$ to me how can $mrs_medlock$ send you away if she finds it out
everybody has sir said $martha$ please dont let her sir pleaded $martha$ i ll send her away if she dares to say a word about such a #thing# said master $mr_archibald_craven$ grandly
she wouldnt like that i can tell you thank you sir bobbing a curtsy i want to do my duty sir
what i want is your duty said $mester_colin$ more grandly still i ll take care of you now go away
when the door closed behind $martha$ $mester_colin$ found mistress $mary_lennox$ gazing at him as if he had set her wondering
why do you look at me like that he asked her what are you thinking about i am thinking about two #thing#
what are they sit down and tell me this is the first #one# said $mary_lennox$ seating herself on the big stool
once in india i saw a boy who was a $rajah$ he had rubies and emeralds and diamonds stuck all over him
he spoke to his people just as you spoke to $martha$ everybody had to do everything he told them in a minute
i think they would have been killed if they hadnt i shall make you tell me about rajahs presently he said but first tell me what the second #thing# was
i was thinking said $mary_lennox$ how different you are from $dickon$ who is $dickon$ he said what a queer name
she might as well tell him she thought she could talk about $dickon$ without mentioning the secret #garden# she had liked to hear $martha$ talk about him
besides she longed to talk about him it would seem to bring him nearer he is $martha$ brother he is twelve years old she explained
he is not like any #one# else in the #world# he can charm foxes and squirrels and birds just as the natives in india charm snakes
he plays a very soft tune on a pipe and they come and listen there were some big books on a table at his side and he dragged #one# suddenly toward him
there is a picture of a snake charmer in this he exclaimed come and look at it the book was a beautiful #one# with superb colored illustrations and he turned to #one# of them
can he do that he asked eagerly he played on his pipe and they listened $mary_lennox$ explained
but he doesnt call it $magic$ he says it because he lives on the moor so much and he knows their ways
he says he feels sometimes as if he was a bird or a rabbit himself he likes them so i think he asked the robin questions
it seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps $mester_colin$ lay back on his cushion and his #eye# grew larger and larger and the spots on his cheeks burned
tell me some more about him he said he knows all about eggs and nests $mary_lennox$ went on and he knows where foxes and badgers and otters live
he keeps them secret so that other boys wont find their holes and frighten them he knows about everything that grows or lives on the moor
does he like the moor said $mester_colin$ how can he when it such a great bare dreary place
thousands of lovely #thing# grow on it and there are thousands of little creatures all busy building nests and making holes and burrows and chippering or singing or squeaking to each other
it the most beautiful place protested $mary_lennox$ they are so busy and having such fun under the earth or in the trees or heather
it their #world# how do you know all that said $mester_colin$ turning on his elbow to look at her
i have never been there once really said $mary_lennox$ suddenly remembering i only drove over it in the dark i thought it was hideous
when $dickon$ talks about it you feel as if you saw #thing# and heard them and as if you were standing in the heather with the sun shining and the gorse smelling like honey and all full of bees and butterflies
$martha$ told me about it first and then $dickon$ you never see anything if you are ill said $mester_colin$ restlessly
he looked like a person listening to a new #sound# in the distance and wondering what it was you cant if you stay in a room said $mary_lennox$
i couldnt go on the moor he said in a resentful tone $mary_lennox$ was silent for a minute and then she said something bold
you might sometime he moved as if he were startled go on the moor how could i i am going to die
how do you know said $mary_lennox$ unsympathetically she didnt like the way he had of talking about dying she did not feel very sympathetic
she felt rather as if he almost boasted about it oh i ve heard it ever since i remember he answered crossly
they are always whispering about it and thinking i dont notice they wish i would too mistress $mary_lennox$ felt quite contrary
she pinched her lips together if they wished i would she said i wouldnt who wishes you would the servants and of #course# dr $mr_archibald_craven$ because he would get misselthwaite and be rich instead of poor
he darent say so but he always looks cheerful when i am worse when i had typhoid fever his face got quite fat
i think my father wishes it too i dont believe he does said $mary_lennox$ quite obstinately that made $mester_colin$ turn and look at her again
dont you he said and then he lay back on his cushion and was still as if he were thinking
and there was quite a long silence perhaps they were both of them thinking strange #thing# children do not usually think
i like the grand doctor from london because he made them take the iron #thing# off said $mary_lennox$ at last
did he say you were going to die no what did he say he didnt whisper $mester_colin$ answered
perhaps he knew i hated whispering i heard him say #one# #thing# quite aloud he said the lad might live if he would make up his mind to it
put him in the humor it sounded as if he was in a temper i ll tell you who would put you in the humor perhaps said $mary_lennox$ reflecting
she felt as if she would like this #thing# to be settled #one# way or the other i believe $dickon$ would
he always talking about live #thing# he never talks about dead #thing# or #thing# that are ill he always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying or looking down at the earth to see something growing
he has such round blue #eye# and they are so wide open with looking about and he laughs such a big laugh with his wide mouth and his cheeks are as red as red as cherries
she pulled her stool nearer to the sofa and her #expression# quite changed at the remembrance of the wide curving mouth and wide open #eye#
see here she said dont let us talk about dying i dont like it let us talk about living
let us talk and talk about $dickon$ and then we will look at your pictures it was the best #thing# she could have said
to talk about $dickon$ meant to talk about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people who lived in it on sixteen shillings a week and the children who got fat on the moor grass like the wild ponies
and about $dickon$ mother and the skipping rope and the moor with the sun on it and about pale green points sticking up out of the black sod
and it was all so alive that $mary_lennox$ talked more than she had ever talked before and $mester_colin$ both talked and listened as he had never done either before
and they laughed so that in the end they were making as much noise as if they had been two ordinary healthy natural ten year old creatures instead of a hard little unloving girl and a sickly boy who believed that he was going to die
and they both began to laugh over nothings as children will when they are happy together they enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures and they forgot about the time
they had been laughing quite loudly over $ben_weatherstaff$ and his robin and $mester_colin$ was actually sitting up as if he had forgotten about his weak back when he suddenly remembered something
do you know there is #one# #thing# we have never once thought of he said we are cousins
it seemed so queer that they had talked so much and never remembered this simple #thing# that they laughed more than ever because they had got into the humor to laugh at anything
and in the midst of the fun the door opened and in walked dr $mr_archibald_craven$ and $mrs_medlock$ dr $mr_archibald_craven$ started in actual alarm and $mrs_medlock$ almost fell back because he had accidentally bumped against her
good lord exclaimed poor $mrs_medlock$ with her #eye# almost starting out of her head good lord what is this said dr $mr_archibald_craven$ coming forward
what does it mean then $mary_lennox$ was reminded of the boy $rajah$ again $mester_colin$ answered as if neither the doctor alarm nor $mrs_medlock$ terror were of the slightest consequence
he was as little disturbed or frightened as if an elderly cat and dog had walked into the room this is my cousin $mary_lennox$ he said
i asked her to come and talk to me i like her she must come and talk to me whenever i send for her
dr $mr_archibald_craven$ turned reproachfully to $mrs_medlock$ oh sir she panted i dont know how it happened there not a servant on the place #tha# dare to talk they all have their orders
nobody told her anything said $mester_colin$ she heard me #crying# and found me herself i am glad she came dont be silly $mrs_medlock$
$mary_lennox$ saw that dr $mr_archibald_craven$ did not look pleased but it was quite plain that he dare not oppose his patient
he sat down by $mester_colin$ and felt his pulse i am afraid there has been too much excitement excitement is not good for you my boy he said
i should be excited if she kept away answered $mester_colin$ his #eye# beginning to look dangerously sparkling i am better
$mrs_medlock$ and dr $mr_archibald_craven$ looked at each other in a troubled way but there was evidently nothing to be done
she makes me better the nurse must bring up her tea with mine we will have tea together he does look rather better sir ventured $mrs_medlock$
but thinking the matter over he looked better this morning before she came into the room she came into the room last night
she stayed with me a long time she sang a hindustani song to me and it made me go to sleep said $mester_colin$
i was better when i wakened up i wanted my breakfast i want my tea now tell nurse $mrs_medlock$
he talked to the nurse for a few minutes when she came into the room and said a few words of warning to $mester_colin$
he must not talk too much he must not forget that he was ill he must not forget that he was very easily tired
dr $mr_archibald_craven$ did not stay very long $mary_lennox$ thought that there seemed to be a number of uncomfortable #thing# he was not to forget
$mester_colin$ looked fretful and kept his strange black lashed #eye# fixed on dr $mr_archibald_craven$ face i want to forget it he said at last
she makes me forget it that is why i want her dr $mr_archibald_craven$ did not look happy when he left the room
she had become a stiff silent child again as soon as he entered and he could not see what the attraction was
he gave a puzzled glance at the little girl sitting on the large stool the boy actually did look brighter however and he sighed rather heavily as he went down the corridor
they are always wanting me to eat #thing# when i dont want to said $mester_colin$ as the nurse brought in the tea and put it on the table by the sofa
now if you ll eat i will those muffins look so nice and hot tell me about rajahs #chapter# xv nest building
after another week of rain the high arch of blue sky appeared again and the sun which poured down was quite hot
though there had been no chance to see either the secret #garden# or $dickon$ mistress $mary_lennox$ had enjoyed herself very much
she had spent hours of every #day# with $mester_colin$ in his room talking about rajahs or #garden# or $dickon$ and the cottage on the moor
they had looked at the splendid books and pictures and sometimes $mary_lennox$ had read #thing# to $mester_colin$ and sometimes he had read a little to her
when he was amused and interested she thought he scarcely looked like an invalid at all except that his face was so colorless and he was always on the sofa
you are a sly young #one# to listen and get out of your bed to go following #thing# up like you
the week had not seemed long did that night $mrs_medlock$ said once but there no saying it not been a sort of blessing to the lot of us
the nurse was just going to give up the case because she was so sick of him but she says she doesnt mind staying now
he not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends you ve gone on duty with her laughing a little
there were certain #thing# she wanted to find out from him but she felt that she must find them out without asking him direct questions
in the first place as she began to like to be with him she wanted to discover whether he was the kind of boy you could tell a secret to
he was not in the least like $dickon$ but he was evidently so pleased with the idea of a #garden# no #one# knew anything about that she thought perhaps he could be trusted
in her talks with $mester_colin$ $mary_lennox$ had tried to be very cautious about the secret #garden# but she had not known him long enough to be sure
if he could be trusted if he really could wouldnt it be possible to take him to the #garden# without having any #one# find it out
the grand doctor had said that he must have fresh air and $mester_colin$ had said that he would not mind fresh air in a secret #garden#
perhaps if he had a great deal of fresh air and knew $dickon$ and the robin and saw #thing# growing he might not think so much about dying
$mary_lennox$ had seen herself in the glass sometimes lately when she had realized that she looked quite a different creature from the child she had seen when she arrived from india
the second #thing# she wanted to find out was this this child looked nicer even $martha$ had seen a change in her
th air from th moor has done thee good already she had said #tha# rt not nigh so yeller and #tha# rt not nigh so scrawny
even #tha# hair doesnt slamp down on #tha# head so flat it got some life in it so as it sticks out a bit
it like me said $mary_lennox$ it growing stronger and fatter i sure there more of it it looks it for sure said $martha$ ruffling it up a little round her face
#tha# rt not half so ugly when it that way an there a bit red in #tha# cheeks if #garden# and fresh air had been good for her perhaps they would be good for $mester_colin$
but then if he hated people to look at him perhaps he would not like to see $dickon$ why does it make you angry when you are looked at
then when they took me to the seaside and i used to lie in my #carriage# everybody used to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my nurse
she inquired #one# #day# i always hated it he answered even when i was very little and then they would begin to whisper
and i knew then they were saying i shouldnt live to grow up then sometimes the ladies would pat my cheeks and say poor child
once when a lady did that i screamed out loud and bit her hand she was so frightened she ran away
she thought you had gone mad like a dog said $mary_lennox$ not at all admiringly i dont care what she thought said $mester_colin$ frowning
i wonder why you didnt scream and bite me when i came into your room said $mary_lennox$ then she began to smile slowly
i thought you were a ghost or a dream he said you cant bite a ghost or a dream and if you scream they dont care
would you hate it if if a boy looked at you $mary_lennox$ asked uncertainly he lay back on his cushion and paused thoughtfully
there #one# boy he said quite slowly as if he were thinking over every word there #one# boy i believe i shouldnt mind
it that boy who knows where the foxes live $dickon$ i sure you wouldnt mind him said $mary_lennox$ the birds dont and other animals he said still thinking it over perhaps that why i shouldnt
then he laughed and she laughed too in fact it ended in their both laughing a great deal and finding the idea of a boy animal hiding in his hole very funny indeed
he a sort of animal charmer and i am a boy animal what $mary_lennox$ felt afterward was that she need not fear about $dickon$
the sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and there was something so joyous in the sight of it that she jumped out of bed and ran to the window
she drew up the blinds and opened the window itself and a great waft of fresh scented air blew in upon her
on that first morning when the sky was blue again $mary_lennox$ wakened very early the moor was blue and the whole #world# looked as if something $magic$ had happened to it
there were tender little fluting #sound# here and there and everywhere as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up for a concert
it will make the green points push up and up and up and it will make the bulbs and roots work and struggle with all their might under the earth
$mary_lennox$ put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun it warm warm she said
she kneeled down and leaned out of the window as far as she could breathing big breaths and sniffing the air until she laughed because she remembered what $dickon$ mother had said about the end of his nose quivering like a rabbit
it must be very early she said the little clouds are all pink and i ve never seen the sky look like this
no #one# is up i dont even hear the stable boys a sudden thought made her scramble to her feet
i cant wait i am going to see the #garden# she had learned to dress herself by this time and she put on her clothes in five minutes
she knew a small side door which she could unbolt herself and she flew downstairs in her stocking feet and put on her shoes in the hall
she unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when the door was open she sprang across the step with #one# bound and there she was standing on the grass which seemed to have turned green and with the sun pouring down on her and warm sweet wafts about her and the fluting and twittering and singing coming from every bush and tree
she clasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky and it was so blue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime light that she felt as if she must flute and sing aloud herself and knew that thrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it
the grass is greener and #thing# are sticking up everywhere and #thing# are uncurling and green buds of leaves are showing
she ran around the shrubs and paths towards the secret #garden# it is all different already she said this afternoon i am sure $dickon$ will come
the long warm rain had done strange #thing# to the herbaceous beds which bordered the walk by the lower wall
there were #thing# sprouting and pushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actually here and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the stems of crocuses
when she had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy she was startled by a curious loud #sound#
six months before mistress $mary_lennox$ would not have seen how the #world# was waking up but now she missed nothing it was the caw caw of a crow
and it came from the top of the wall and when she looked up there sat a big glossy plumaged blue black bird looking down at her very wisely indeed
she had never seen a crow so close before and he made her a little nervous but the next moment he spread his wings and flapped away across the #garden#
when she got fairly into the #garden# she saw that he probably did intend to stay because he had alighted on a dwarf apple tree and under the apple tree was lying a little reddish animal with a bushy tail and both of them were watching the stooping body and rust red head of $dickon$ who was kneeling on the grass working hard
she hoped he was not going to stay inside and she pushed the door open wondering if he would $mary_lennox$ flew across the grass to him
oh $dickon$ dickon she cried out how could you get here so early how could you the sun has only just got up
he got up himself laughing and glowing and tousled his #eye# like a bit of the sky eh he said
i was up long before him how could i have stayed abed th #world# all fair begun again this mornin it has
an it workin an hummin an scratchin an pipin an nest buildin an breathin out scents till you ve got to be out on it stead lyin on your back
when th sun did jump up th moor went mad for joy an i was in the midst of th heather
an i run like mad myself shoutin an singin an i come straight here i couldnt have stayed away why th #garden# was lyin here waitin
$mary_lennox$ put her hands on her chest panting as if she had been running herself oh $dickon$ dickon she said
seeing him talking to a stranger the little bushy tailed animal rose from its place under the tree and came to him and the rook cawing once flew down from its branch and settled quietly on his shoulder
i so happy i can scarcely breathe this is th little fox cub he said rubbing the little reddish animal head
it named captain an this here soot soot he flew across th moor with me an captain he run same as if th hounds had been after him
they both felt same as i did neither of the creatures looked as if he were the least afraid of $mary_lennox$
when $dickon$ began to walk about soot stayed on his shoulder and captain trotted quietly close to his side see here said $dickon$
see how these has pushed up an these an these an eh look at these here he threw himself upon his knees and $mary_lennox$ went down beside him
they had come upon a whole clump of crocuses burst into purple and orange and gold $mary_lennox$ bent her face down and kissed and kissed them
you never kiss a person in that way she said when she lifted her head flowers are so different
eh he said i ve kissed mother many a time that way when i come in from th moor after a #day# roamin an she stood there at th door in th sun lookin so glad an comfortable
they ran from #one# part of the #garden# to another and found so many wonders that they were obliged to remind themselves that they must whisper or speak low
he looked puzzled but smiled he showed her swelling leafbuds on rose branches which had seemed dead he showed her ten thousand new green points pushing through the mould
they put their eager young noses close to the earth and sniffed its warmed springtime breathing they dug and pulled and laughed low with rapture until mistress $mary_lennox$ hair was as tumbled as $dickon$ and her cheeks were almost as poppy red as his
there was every joy on earth in the secret #garden# that morning and in the midst of them came a delight more delightful than all because it was more wonderful
swiftly something flew across the wall and darted through the trees to a close grown corner a little flare of red breasted bird with something hanging from its beak
$dickon$ stood quite still and put his hand on $mary_lennox$ almost as if they had suddenly found themselves laughing in a church
we munnot stir he whispered in broad $yorkshire$ we munnot scarce breathe i knowed he was mate huntin when i seed him last
it $ben_weatherstaff$ robin he buildin his nest he ll stay here if us dont fight him they settled down softly upon the grass and sat there without moving
us mustnt seem as if us was watchin him too close said $dickon$ he be out with us for good if he got th notion us
was interferin now he ll be a good bit different till all this is over he settin up housekeepin he ll be shyer an readier to take #thing# ill
he got no time for visitin an gossipin us must keep still a bit an try to look as if us was grass an trees an bushes
then when he got used to seein us i ll chirp a bit an he ll know us ll not be in his way
mistress $mary_lennox$ was not at all sure that she knew as $dickon$ seemed to how to try to look like grass and trees and bushes
but he had said the queer #thing# as if it were the simplest and most natural #thing# in the #world# and she felt it must be quite easy to him and indeed she watched him for a few minutes carefully wondering if it was possible for him to quietly turn green and put out branches and leaves
but he only sat wonderfully still and when he spoke dropped his voice to such a softness that it was curious that she could hear him but she could
it part th springtime this nest buildin is he said i warrant it been goin on in th same way every year since th #world# was begun
they ve got their way thinkin and doin #thing# an a body had better not meddle you can lose a friend in springtime easier than any other season if you re too curious
if we talk about him i cant help looking at him $mary_lennox$ said as softly as possible we must talk of something else
there is something i want to tell you he ll like it better if us talks somethin else said $dickon$
what is it #tha# got to tell me well do you know about $mester_colin$ she whispered he turned his head to look at her
what does #tha# know about him he asked i ve seen him i have been to talk to him every #day# this week
he wants me to come he says i making him forget about being ill and dying answered $mary_lennox$ $dickon$ looked actually relieved as soon as the surprise died away from his round face
i am glad that he exclaimed i right down glad it makes me easier i knowed i must say nothin about him
an i dont like havin to hide #thing# dont you like hiding the #garden# said $mary_lennox$ i ll never tell about it he answered
but i says to mother mother i says i got a secret to keep it not a bad un #tha# knows that
it no worse than hidin where a bird nest is #tha# doesnt mind it does #tha# $mary_lennox$ always wanted to hear about mother
what did she say she asked not at all afraid to hear $dickon$ grinned sweet temperedly it was just like her what she said he answered
she give my head a bit of a rub an laughed an she says eh lad #tha# can have all th secrets #tha# likes
everybody as knowed about $mester_colin$ $mr_archibald_craven$ knowed there was a little lad as was like to be a cripple an they knowed $mester_colin$ $mr_archibald_craven$ didnt like him to be talked about
folks is sorry for $mester_colin$ $mr_archibald_craven$ because mrs $mr_archibald_craven$ was such a pretty young lady an they was so fond of each other
$mrs_medlock$ stops in our cottage whenever she goes to thwaite an she doesnt mind talkin to mother before us children because she knows us has been brought up to be trusty
i ve knowed thee twelve year how did you know about $mester_colin$ asked $mary_lennox$ how did #tha# find out about him
$martha$ was in fine trouble th last time she came home she said #tha# heard him frettin an #tha# was askin questions an she didnt know what to say
$mary_lennox$ told him her story about the midnight wuthering of the wind which had wakened her and about the faint far off #sound# of the complaining voice which had led her down the dark corridors with her candle and had ended with her opening of the door of the dimly lighted room with the carven four posted bed in the corner
when she described the small ivory white face and the strange black rimmed #eye# $dickon$ shook his head them just like his mother #eye# only hers was always laughin they say he said
an it because his #eye# is so like his mother an yet looks so different in his miserable bit of a face
they say as $mr_archibald_craven$ cant bear to see him when he awake do you think he wants to die whispered $mary_lennox$
no but he wishes he never been born mother she says that th worst #thing# on earth for a child
$mester_colin$ $mr_archibald_craven$ he buy anythin as money could buy for th poor lad but he like to forget as he on earth
them as is not wanted scarce ever thrives for #one# #thing# he afraid he ll look at him some #day# and find he growed hunchback
he says he always thinking that if he should feel a lump coming he should go crazy and scream himself to death
$mester_colin$ so afraid of it himself that he wont sit up said $mary_lennox$ eh he oughtnt to lie there thinkin #thing# like that said $dickon$
the fox was lying on the grass close by him looking up to ask for a pat now and then and $dickon$ bent down and rubbed his neck softly and thought a few minutes in silence
no lad could get well as thought them sort #thing# presently he lifted his head and looked round the #garden#
when first we got in here he said it seemed like everything was gray look round now and tell me if #tha# doesnt see a difference
$mary_lennox$ looked and caught her breath a little why she cried the gray wall is changing it is as if a green mist were creeping over it
it almost like a green gauze veil aye said $dickon$ an it ll be greener and greener till th gray all gone
can #tha# guess what i was thinkin i know it was something nice said $mary_lennox$ eagerly i believe it was something about $mester_colin$
i was thinkin that if he was out here he wouldnt be watchin for lumps to grow on his back he be watchin for buds to break on th rose bushes an he likely be healthier explained $dickon$
i was wonderin if us could ever get him in th humor to come out here an lie under th trees in his #carriage#
i ve wondered if he could keep a secret and i ve wondered if we could bring him here without any #one# seeing us
i ve been wondering that myself i ve thought of it almost every time i ve talked to him said $mary_lennox$ i thought perhaps you could push his #carriage#
the doctor said he must have fresh air and if he wants us to take him out no #one# dare disobey him
he wont go out for other people and perhaps they will be glad if he will go out with us he could order the gardeners to keep away so they wouldnt find out
$dickon$ was thinking very hard as he scratched captain back it be good for him i ll warrant he said
us not be thinkin he better never been born us be just two children watchin a #garden# grow an he be another
two lads an a little lass just lookin on at th springtime i warrant it be better than doctor stuff
he been lying in his room so long and he always been so afraid of his back that it has made him queer said $mary_lennox$
he says he has been too ill to notice #thing# and he hates going out of doors and hates #garden# and gardeners
he knows a good many #thing# out of books but he doesnt know anything else but he likes to hear about this #garden# because it is a secret
i darent tell him much but he said he wanted to see it us ll have him out here sometime for sure said $dickon$
i could push his #carriage# well enough has #tha# noticed how th robin an his mate has been workin while we ve been sittin here
look at him perched on that branch wonderin where it be best to put that twig he got in his beak
he made #one# of his low whistling calls and the robin turned his head and looked at him inquiringly still holding his twig
$dickon$ spoke to him as $ben_weatherstaff$ did but $dickon$ tone was #one# of friendly advice wheres ever #tha# puts it he said it ll be all right
#tha# knew how to build #tha# nest before #tha# came out th egg get on with thee lad #tha# st got no time to lose
$ben_weatherstaff$ scolds him and makes fun of him and he hops about and looks as if he understood every word and i know he likes it
oh i do like to hear you talk to him $mary_lennox$ said laughing delightedly $ben_weatherstaff$ says he is so conceited he would rather have stones thrown at him than not be noticed
$dickon$ laughed too and went on talking #tha# knows us wont trouble thee he said to the robin
us is near bein wild #thing# ourselves us is nest buildin too bless thee look out #tha# doesnt tell on us
and though the robin did not answer because his beak was occupied $mary_lennox$ knew that when he flew away with his twig to his own corner of the #garden# the darkness of his dew bright #eye# meant that he would not tell their secret for the #world#
they found a great deal to do that morning and $mary_lennox$ was late in returning to the house and was also in such a hurry to get back to her work that she quite forgot $mester_colin$ until the last moment
#chapter# xvi i wont said $mary_lennox$ tell $mester_colin$ that i cant come and see him yet she said to $martha$
i very busy in the #garden# $martha$ looked rather frightened eh miss $mary_lennox$ she said it may put him all out of humor when i tell him that
but $mary_lennox$ was not as afraid of him as other people were and she was not a self sacrificing person
i cant stay she answered $dickon$ waiting for me and she ran away the afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning had been
already nearly all the weeds were cleared out of the #garden# and most of the roses and trees had been pruned or dug about
$dickon$ had brought a spade of his own and he had taught $mary_lennox$ to use all her tools so that by this time it was plain that though the lovely wild place was not likely to become a gardener #garden# it would be a wilderness of growing #thing# before the springtime was over
there ll be apple blossoms an cherry blossoms overhead $dickon$ said working away with all his might an there ll be peach an plum trees in bloom against th walls an th grass ll be a carpet flowers
the little fox and the rook were as happy and busy as they were and the robin and his mate flew backward and forward like tiny streaks of lightning
each time he came back and perched near $dickon$ and cawed several times as if he were relating his adventures and $dickon$ talked to him just as he had talked to the robin
once when $dickon$ was so busy that he did not answer him at first soot flew on to his shoulders and gently tweaked his ear with his large beak
when $mary_lennox$ wanted to rest a little $dickon$ sat down with her under a tree and once he took his pipe out of his pocket and played the soft strange little notes and two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened
sometimes the rook flapped his black wings and soared away over the tree tops in the park #tha# a good bit stronger than #tha# was $dickon$ said looking at her as she was digging
#tha# beginning to look different for sure $mary_lennox$ was glowing with exercise and good spirits i getting fatter and fatter every #day# she said quite exultantly
$mrs_medlock$ will have to get me some bigger dresses $martha$ says my hair is growing thicker it isnt so flat and stringy
the sun was beginning to set and sending deep gold colored rays slanting under the trees when they parted it ll be fine tomorrow said $dickon$
i ll be at work by sunrise so will i said $mary_lennox$ she ran back to the house as quickly as her feet would carry her
she wanted to tell $mester_colin$ about $dickon$ fox cub and the rook and about what the springtime had been doing she felt sure he would like to hear
so it was not very pleasant when she opened the door of her room to see $martha$ standing waiting for her with a doleful face
what is the matter she asked what did $mester_colin$ say when you told him i couldnt come eh said $martha$ i wish #tha# gone
he was nigh goin into #one# his tantrums there been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him quiet
she was no more used to considering other people than $mester_colin$ was and she saw no reason why an ill tempered boy should interfere with the #thing# she liked best
she knew nothing about the pitifulness of people who had been ill and nervous and who did not know that they could control their tempers and need not make other people ill and nervous too
when she had had a headache in india she had done her best to see that everybody else also had a headache or something quite as bad
he would watch the clock all th time $mary_lennox$ lips pinched themselves together and she felt she was quite right but of #course# now she felt that $mester_colin$ was quite wrong
he was not on his sofa when she went into his room he was lying flat on his back in bed
and he did not turn his head toward her as she came in this was a bad beginning and $mary_lennox$ marched up to him with her stiff manner
why didnt you get up she said i did get up this morning when i thought you were coming he answered without looking at her
i made them put me back in bed this afternoon my back ached and my head ached and i was tired
why didnt you come i was working in the #garden# with $dickon$ said $mary_lennox$ $mester_colin$ frowned and condescended to look at her
i wont let that boy come here if you go and stay with him instead of coming to talk to me he said
$mary_lennox$ flew into a fine passion she could fly into a passion without making a noise she just grew sour and obstinate and did not care what happened
if you send $dickon$ away i ll never come into this room again she retorted you ll have to if i want you said $mester_colin$
i wont said $mary_lennox$ i ll make you said $mester_colin$ they shall drag you in shall they mr $rajah$
said $mary_lennox$ fiercely they may drag me in but they cant make me talk when they get me here
i ll sit and clench my teeth and never tell you #one# #thing# i wont even look at you i ll stare at the floor
they were a nice agreeable pair as they glared at each other if they had been two little street boys they would have sprung at each other and had a rough and tumble fight
as it was they did the next #thing# to it you are a selfish #thing# cried $mester_colin$ what are you said $mary_lennox$
selfish people always say that any #one# is selfish who doesnt do what they want you re more selfish than i am
you re the most selfish boy i ever saw i not snapped $mester_colin$ i not as selfish as your fine $dickon$ is
he keeps you playing in the dirt when he knows i am all by myself he selfish if you like $mary_lennox$ #eye# flashed fire
he nicer than any other boy that ever lived she said he he like an angel it might #sound# rather silly to say that
but she did not care a nice angel $mester_colin$ sneered ferociously he a common cottage boy off the moor
he better than a common $rajah$ retorted $mary_lennox$ he a thousand times better because she was the stronger of the two she was beginning to get the better of him
the truth was that he had never had a fight with any #one# like himself in his life and upon the whole it was rather good for him though neither he nor $mary_lennox$ knew anything about that
he turned his head on his pillow and shut his #eye# and a big tear was squeezed out and ran down his cheek
i not as selfish as you because i always ill and i sure there is a lump coming on my back he said
he was beginning to feel pathetic and sorry for himself not for any #one# else and i am going to die besides
you re not contradicted $mary_lennox$ unsympathetically he opened his #eye# quite wide with indignation he had never heard such a #thing# said before
he was at once furious and slightly pleased if a person could be both at #one# time i not he cried
i am you know i am everybody says so i dont believe it said $mary_lennox$ sourly you just say that to make people sorry
i believe you re proud of it i dont believe it if you were a nice boy it might be true but you re too nasty
in spite of his invalid back $mester_colin$ sat up in bed in quite a healthy rage get out of the room
he was not strong enough to throw it far and it only fell at her feet but $mary_lennox$ face looked as pinched as a nutcracker
he shouted and he caught hold of his pillow and threw it at her i going she said
and i wont come back she walked to the door and when she reached it she turned round and spoke again
i was going to tell you all sorts of nice #thing# she said $dickon$ brought his fox and his rook
she marched out of the door and closed it behind her and there to her great astonishment she found the trained nurse standing as if she had been listening and more amazing still she was laughing
she was a big handsome young woman who ought not to have been a trained nurse at all as she could not bear invalids and she was always making excuses to leave $mester_colin$ to $martha$ or any #one# else who would take her place
$mary_lennox$ had never liked her and she simply stood and gazed up at her as she stood giggling into her handkerchief
and i was going to tell you all about them now i wont tell you a single #thing# what are you laughing at
it the best #thing# that could happen to the sickly pampered #thing# to have some #one# to stand up to him that as spoiled as himself and she laughed into her handkerchief again
she asked her at you two young #one# said the nurse if he had a young vixen of a #sister# to fight with it would have been the saving of him
is he going to die i dont know and i dont care said the nurse hysterics and temper are half what ails him
you ll find out if you work him into a tantrum after this but at any rate you ve given him something to have hysterics about and i glad of it
$mary_lennox$ went back to her room not feeling at all as she had felt when she had come in from the #garden#
what are hysterics asked $mary_lennox$ she was cross and disappointed but not at all sorry for $mester_colin$
and she had meant to try to make up her mind whether it would be safe to trust him with the great secret
she had looked forward to telling him a great many #thing# she had been beginning to think it would be but now she had changed her mind entirely
she would never tell him and he could stay in his room and never get any fresh air and die if he liked
she felt so sour and unrelenting that for a few minutes she almost forgot about $dickon$ and the green veil creeping over the #world# and the soft wind blowing down from the moor
it would serve him right $martha$ was waiting for her and the trouble in her face had been temporarily replaced by interest and curiosity
there was a wooden box on the table and its cover had been removed and revealed that it was full of neat packages
$mr_archibald_craven$ sent it to you said $martha$ it looks as if it had picture books in it $mary_lennox$ remembered what he had asked her the #day# she had gone to his room
she opened the package wondering if he had sent a doll and also wondering what she should do with it if he had
there were several beautiful books such as $mester_colin$ had and two of them were about #garden# and were full of pictures
there were two or three games and there was a beautiful little writing case with a gold monogram on it and a gold pen and inkstand
do you want anything dolls toys books but he had not sent #one# everything was so nice that her pleasure began to crowd her anger out of her mind
i can write better than i can print she said and the first #thing# i shall write with that pen will be a letter to tell him i am much obliged
if she had been friends with $mester_colin$ she would have run to show him her presents at once and they would have looked at the pictures and read some of the gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games and he would have enjoyed himself so much he would never once have thought he was going to die or have put his hand on his spine to see if there was a lump coming
she had not expected him to remember her at all and her hard little heart grew quite warm he had a way of doing that which she could not bear
he said that if he felt even quite a little lump some #day# he should know his hunch had begun to grow
something he had heard $mrs_medlock$ whispering to the nurse had given him the idea and he had thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in his mind
$mrs_medlock$ had said his father back had begun to show its crookedness in that way when he was a child
he had never told any #one# but $mary_lennox$ that most of his tantrums as they called them grew out of his hysterical hidden fear
it gave her an uncomfortable frightened feeling because he always looked so frightened himself $mary_lennox$ had been sorry for him when he had told her
he always began to think about it when he was cross or tired she said to herself and he has been cross today
perhaps perhaps he has been thinking about it all afternoon she stood still looking down at the carpet and thinking
i said i would never go back again she hesitated knitting her brows but perhaps just perhaps i will go and see if he wants me in the morning
perhaps he ll try to throw his pillow at me again but i think i ll go #chapter# xvii a tantrum she had got up very early in the morning and had worked hard in the #garden#
and she was tired and sleepy so as soon as $martha$ had brought her supper and she had eaten it she was glad to go to bed
as she laid her head on the pillow she murmured to herself i ll go out before breakfast and work with $dickon$ and then afterward i believe i ll go to see him
she thought it was the middle of the night when she was awakened by such dreadful #sound# that she jumped out of bed in an instant
doors were opened and shut and there were hurrying feet in the corridors and some #one# was #crying# and screaming at the same time screaming and #crying# in a horrible way
what was it what was it the next minute she felt quite sure she knew it $mester_colin$ she said
as she listened to the sobbing screams she did not wonder that people were so frightened that they gave him his own way in everything rather than hear them
he having #one# of those tantrums the nurse called hysterics how awful it #sound# she put her hands over her ears and felt sick and shivering
i dont know what to do i dont know what to do she kept saying i cant bear it
and then she remembered how he had driven her out of the room and thought that perhaps the sight of her might make him worse
once she wondered if he would stop if she dared go to him even when she pressed her hands more tightly over her ears she could not keep the awful #sound# out
and she felt as if she should like to fly into a tantrum herself and frighten him as he was frightening her
she hated them so and was so terrified by them that suddenly they began to make her angry she was not used to any #one# tempers but her own
she took her hands from her ears and sprang up and stamped her foot he ought to be stopped somebody ought to make him stop
somebody ought to beat him she cried out just then she heard feet almost running down the corridor and her door opened and the nurse came in
she was not laughing now by any means she even looked rather pale he worked himself into hysterics she said in a great hurry
he ll do himself harm no #one# can do anything with him you come and try like a good child he likes you
he turned me out of the room this morning said $mary_lennox$ stamping her foot with excitement the stamp rather pleased the nurse
the truth was that she had been afraid she might find $mary_lennox$ #crying# and hiding her head under the bed clothes
that right she said you re in the right humor you go and scold him give him something new to think of
it was not until afterward that $mary_lennox$ realized that the #thing# had been funny as well as dreadful that it was funny that all the grown up people were so frightened that they came to a little girl just because they guessed she was almost as bad as $mester_colin$ himself
do go child as quick as ever you can she flew along the corridor and the nearer she got to the screams the higher her temper mounted
she felt quite wicked by the time she reached the door she slapped it open with her hand and ran across the room to the four posted bed
you stop she almost shouted you stop i hate you everybody hates you i wish everybody would run out of the house and let you scream yourself to death
a nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor said such #thing# but it just happened that the shock of hearing them was the best possible #thing# for this hysterical boy whom no #one# had ever dared to restrain or contradict
he had been lying on his face beating his pillow with his hands and he actually almost jumped around he turned so quickly at the #sound# of the furious little voice
his face looked dreadful white and red and swollen and he was gasping and choking but savage little $mary_lennox$ did not care an atom
if you scream another scream she said i ll scream too and i can scream louder than you can and i ll frighten you i ll frighten you
you will scream yourself to death in a minute and i wish you would he actually had stopped screaming because she had startled him so
the scream which had been coming almost choked him the tears were streaming down his face and he shook all over
i cant stop he gasped and sobbed i cant i cant you can shouted $mary_lennox$ half that ails you is hysterics and temper just hysterics hysterics hysterics
and she stamped each time she said it i felt the lump i felt it choked out $mester_colin$ i knew i should
i shall have a hunch on my back and then i shall die and he began to writhe again and turned on his face and sobbed and wailed
but he didnt scream you didnt feel a lump contradicted $mary_lennox$ fiercely if you did it was only a hysterical lump
hysterics makes lumps there nothing the matter with your horrid back nothing but hysterics turn over and let me look at it
she liked the word hysterics and felt somehow as if it had an effect on him he was probably like herself and had never heard it before
the nurse $mrs_medlock$ and $martha$ had been standing huddled together near the door staring at her their mouths half open
nurse she commanded come here and show me his back this minute all three had gasped with fright more than once
the nurse came forward as if she were half afraid $mester_colin$ was heaving with great breathless sobs perhaps he he wont let me she hesitated in a low voice
$mester_colin$ heard her however and he gasped out between two sobs sh show her she she ll see then it was a poor thin back to look at when it was bared
every rib could be counted and every joint of the spine though mistress $mary_lennox$ did not count them as she bent over and examined them with a solemn savage little face
there was just a minute silence for even $mester_colin$ tried to hold his breath while $mary_lennox$ looked up and down his spine and down and up as intently as if she had been the great doctor from london
she looked so sour and old fashioned that the nurse turned her head aside to hide the twitching of her mouth
there not a single lump there she said at last there not a lump as big as a pin except backbone lumps and you can only feel them because you re thin
i ve got backbone lumps myself and they used to stick out as much as yours do until i began to get fatter and i am not fat enough yet to hide them
there not a lump as big as a pin if you ever say there is again i shall laugh no #one#
if he had ever had any #one# to talk to about his secret terrors if he had ever dared to let himself ask questions if he had had childish companions and had not lain on his back in the huge closed house breathing an atmosphere heavy with the fears of people who were most of them ignorant and tired of him he would have found out that most of his fright and illness was created by himself
but he had lain and thought of himself and his aches and weariness for hours and #day# and months and years
and now that an angry unsympathetic little girl insisted obstinately that he was not as ill as he thought he was
but $mester_colin$ himself knew what effect those crossly spoken childish words had on him he actually felt as if she might be speaking the truth
i didnt know ventured the nurse that he thought he had a lump on his spine his back is weak because he wont try to sit up
i could have told him there was no lump there $mester_colin$ gulped and turned his face a little to look at her
$mester_colin$ turned on his face again and but for his long drawn broken breaths which were the dying down of his storm of sobbing he lay still for a minute though great tears streamed down his face and wet the pillow
could you he said pathetically yes sir there said $mary_lennox$ and she gulped too actually the tears meant that a curious great relief had come to him
presently he turned and looked at the nurse again and strangely enough he was not like a $rajah$ at all as he spoke to her
do you think i could live to grow up he said the nurse was neither clever nor soft hearted but she could repeat some of the london doctor words
you probably will if you will do what you are told to do and not give way to your temper and stay out a great deal in the fresh air
$mester_colin$ tantrum had passed and he was weak and worn out with #crying# and this perhaps made him feel gentle
he put out his hand a little toward $mary_lennox$ and i am glad to say that her own tantum having passed she was softened too and met him half way with her hand so that it was a sort of making up
he remembered just in time to stop himself from saying if we can find the secret #garden# and he ended i shall like to go out with you if $dickon$ will come and push my chair
i ll i ll go out with you $mary_lennox$ he said i shant hate fresh air if we can find i do so want to see $dickon$ and the fox and the crow
then she made $mester_colin$ a cup of beef tea and gave a cup to $mary_lennox$ who really was very glad to get it after her excitement
$mrs_medlock$ and $martha$ gladly slipped away and after everything was neat and calm and in order the nurse looked as if she would very gladly slip away also
she was a healthy young woman who resented being robbed of her sleep and she yawned quite openly as she looked at $mary_lennox$ who had pushed her big footstool close to the four posted bed and was holding $mester_colin$ hand
the nurse remade the tumbled bed and shook and straightened the pillows you must go back and get your sleep out she said
he ll drop off after a while if he not too upset then i ll lie down myself in the next room
would you like me to sing you that song i learned from my ayah $mary_lennox$ whispered to $mester_colin$ his hand pulled hers gently and he turned his tired #eye# on her appealingly
oh yes he answered it such a soft song i shall go to sleep in a minute i will put him to sleep $mary_lennox$ said to the yawning nurse
you can go if you like well said the nurse with an attempt at reluctance if he doesnt go to sleep in half an hour you must call me
the nurse was out of the room in a minute and as soon as she was gone $mester_colin$ pulled $mary_lennox$ hand again
i wont talk and i ll go to sleep but you said you had a whole lot of nice #thing# to tell me
very well answered $mary_lennox$ i almost told he said but i stopped myself in time have you do you think you have found out anything at all about the way into the secret #garden#
$mary_lennox$ looked at his poor little tired face and swollen #eye# and her heart relented ye es she answered i think i have
and if you will go to sleep i will tell you tomorrow his hand quite trembled oh $mary_lennox$
do you suppose that instead of singing the ayah song you could just tell me softly as you did that first #day# what you imagine it looks like inside
he said oh $mary_lennox$ if i could get into it i think i should live to grow up i am sure it will make me go to sleep
yes answered $mary_lennox$ shut your #eye# he closed his #eye# and lay quite still and she held his hand and began to speak very slowly and in a very low voice
i think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbed until they hang from the branches and walls and creep over the ground almost like a strange gray mist
some of them have died but many are alive and when the summer comes there will be curtains and fountains of roses
i think the ground is full of daffodils and snowdrops and lilies and iris working their way out of the dark
now the spring has begun perhaps perhaps the soft drone of her voice was making him stiller and stiller and she saw it and went on
i think it has been left alone so long that it has grown all into a lovely tangle perhaps they are coming up through the grass perhaps there are clusters of purple crocuses and gold #one# even now
perhaps the leaves are beginning to break out and uncurl and perhaps the gray is changing and a green gauze veil is creeping and creeping over everything
and the birds are coming to look at it because it is so safe and still and perhaps perhaps perhaps very softly and slowly indeed the robin has found a mate and is building a nest
and $mester_colin$ was asleep #chapter# xviii #tha# munnot waste no time of #course# $mary_lennox$ did not waken early the next morning
$mester_colin$ was quite quiet he was ill and feverish as he always was after he had worn himself out with a fit of #crying#
she slept late because she was tired and when $martha$ brought her breakfast she told her that though $mary_lennox$ ate her breakfast slowly as she listened
he says he wishes #tha# would please go and see him as soon as #tha# can $martha$ said it queer what a fancy he took to thee
#tha# did give it him last night for sure didnt #tha# nobody else would have dared to do it eh poor lad
mother says as th two worst #thing# as can happen to a child is never to have his own way or always to have it
he been spoiled till salt wont save him she doesnt know which is th worst #tha# was in a fine temper #tha# self too
but he says to me when i went into his room please ask miss $mary_lennox$ if she ll please come an talk to me
think him saying please will you go miss i ll run and see $dickon$ first said $mary_lennox$ no i ll go and see $mester_colin$ first and tell him i know what i ll tell him with a sudden inspiration
she had her hat on when she appeared in $mester_colin$ room and for a second he looked disappointed he was in bed
his face was pitifully white and there were dark circles round his #eye# i glad you came he said
my head aches and i ache all over because i so tired are you going somewhere $mary_lennox$ went and leaned against his bed
i wont be long she said i going to $dickon$ but i ll come back $mester_colin$ it it something about the #garden#
his whole face brightened and a little #color# came into it oh is it he cried out
i dreamed about it all night i heard you say something about gray changing into green and i dreamed i was standing in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves and there were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still
i ll lie and think about it until you come back in five minutes $mary_lennox$ was with $dickon$ in their #garden#
the fox and the crow were with him again and this time he had brought two tame squirrels i came over on the pony this mornin he said
eh he is a good little chap jump is i brought these two in my pockets this here #one# he called nut an this here other #one# called $shell$
when he said nut #one# squirrel leaped on to his right shoulder and when he said $shell$ the other #one# leaped on to his left shoulder
when they sat down on the grass with captain curled at their feet soot solemnly listening on a tree and nut and $shell$ nosing about close to them it seemed to $mary_lennox$ that it would be scarcely bearable to leave such delightfulness but when she began to tell her story somehow
the look in $dickon$ funny face gradually changed her mind she could see he felt sorrier for $mester_colin$ than she did
he looked up at the sky and all about him just listen to them birds th #world# seems full of em all whistlin an pipin he said
look at em dartin about an hearken at em callin to each other come springtime seems like as if all th #world# callin
the leaves is uncurlin so you can see em an my word th nice smells there is about sniffing with his happy turned up nose
an that poor lad lyin shut up an seein so little that he gets to thinkin #thing# as sets him screamin
eh my we mun get him out here we mun get him watchin an listenin an sniffin up th air an get him just soaked through wi sunshine
when he was very much interested he often spoke quite broad $yorkshire$ though at other times he tried to modify his dialect so that $mary_lennox$ could better understand
an we munnot lose no time about it but she loved his broad $yorkshire$ and had in fact been trying to learn to speak it herself
i ll tell thee what us ll do first she proceeded and $dickon$ grinned because when the little wench tried to twist her tongue into speaking $yorkshire$ it amused him very much
so she spoke a little now aye that we mun she said which meant yes indeed we must
when i go back to the house to talk to him i ll ax him if #tha# canna come an see him tomorrow
he took a graidely fancy to thee he wants to see thee and he wants to see soot an captain mornin an
bring #tha# creatures wi thee an then in a bit when there more leaves out an happen a bud or two we ll get him to come out an #tha# shall push him in his chair
an we ll bring him here an show him everything when she stopped she was quite proud of herself she had never made a long speech in $yorkshire$ before and she had remembered very well
#tha# mun talk a bit $yorkshire$ like that to $mester_colin$ $dickon$ chuckled #tha# ll make him laugh an there nowt as good for ill folk as laughin is
mother says she believes as half a hour good laugh every mornin ud cure a chap as was makin ready for typhus fever
the #garden# had reached the time when every #day# and every night it seemed as if magicians were passing through it drawing loveliness out of the earth and the boughs with wands
it was hard to go away and leave it all particularly as nut had actually crept on to her dress and $shell$ had scrambled down the trunk of the apple tree they sat under and stayed there looking at her with inquiring #eye#
but she went back to the house and when she sat down close to $mester_colin$ bed he began to sniff as $dickon$ did though not in such an experienced way
i going to talk $yorkshire$ to him this very #day# said $mary_lennox$ chuckling herself you smell like flowers and and fresh #thing# he cried out quite joyously
what is it you smell of it cool and warm and sweet all at the same time it th wind from th moor said $mary_lennox$
it comes sittin on th grass under a tree wi $dickon$ an wi captain an soot an nut an $shell$
she said it as broadly as she could and you do not know how broadly $yorkshire$ #sound# until you have heard some #one# speak it
it th springtime an out doors an sunshine as smells so graidely $mester_colin$ began to laugh what are you doing
he said i never heard you talk like that before how funny it #sound# i givin thee a bit o
$yorkshire$ answered $mary_lennox$ triumphantly i canna talk as graidely as $dickon$ an $martha$ can but #tha# sees i can shape a bit
doesnt #tha# understand a bit $yorkshire$ when #tha# hears it an #tha# a $yorkshire$ lad thysel bred an born eh
and then she began to laugh too and they both laughed until they could not stop themselves and they laughed until the room echoed and $mrs_medlock$ opening the door to come in drew back into the corridor and stood listening amazed
i wonder #tha# rt not ashamed thy face well upon my word she said speaking rather broad $yorkshire$ herself because there was no #one# to hear her
and she was so astonished whoever heard th like whoever on earth would ha thought it there was so much to talk about
it seemed as if $mester_colin$ could never hear enough of $dickon$ and captain and soot and nut and $shell$ and the pony whose name was jump
he was a tiny little shaggy moor pony with thick locks hanging over his #eye# and with a pretty face and a nuzzling velvet nose
he was rather thin with living on moor grass but he was as tough and wiry as if the muscle in his little legs had been made of steel springs
he had lifted his head and whinnied softly the moment he saw $dickon$ and he had trotted up to him and put his head across his shoulder
$mary_lennox$ had run round into the wood with $dickon$ to see jump and then $dickon$ had talked into his ear and jump had talked back in odd little whinnies and puffs and snorts
$dickon$ had made him give $mary_lennox$ his small front hoof and kiss her on her cheek with his velvet muzzle
does he really understand everything $dickon$ says $mester_colin$ asked it seems as if he does answered $mary_lennox$ $dickon$ says anything will understand if you re friends with it for sure but you have to be friends for sure
$mester_colin$ lay quiet a little while and his strange gray #eye# seemed to be staring at the wall but $mary_lennox$ saw he was thinking
i wish i was friends with #thing# he said at last but i not i never had anything to be friends with and i cant bear people
cant you bear me asked $mary_lennox$ yes i can he answered it funny but i even like you $ben_weatherstaff$ said i was like him said $mary_lennox$
he said he warrant we both got the same nasty tempers i think you are like him too we are all three alike you and i and $ben_weatherstaff$
he said we were neither of us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked but i dont feel as sour as i used to before i knew the robin and $dickon$
did you feel as if you hated people yes answered $mary_lennox$ without any affectation i should have detested you if i had seen you before i saw the robin and $dickon$
$mester_colin$ put out his thin hand and touched her $mary_lennox$ he said i wish i hadnt said what i did about sending $dickon$ away
i hated you when you said he was like an angel and i laughed at you but but perhaps he is
well it was rather funny to say it she admitted frankly because his nose does turn up and he has a big mouth and his clothes have patches all over them and he talks broad $yorkshire$
i believe he understand the green #thing# and know how to make them grow and he would know how to talk to the wild creatures as $dickon$ does
but but if an angel did come to $yorkshire$ and live on the moor if there was a $yorkshire$ angel and they know he was friends for sure
i glad you said that answered $mary_lennox$ because because quite suddenly it came into her mind that this was the minute to tell him
i shouldnt mind $dickon$ looking at me said $mester_colin$ i want to see him $mester_colin$ knew something new was coming
$mary_lennox$ was so anxious that she got up from her stool and came to him and caught hold of both his hands
because what he cried eagerly can i trust you i trusted $dickon$ because birds trusted him can i trust you for sure for sure
she implored her face was so solemn that he almost whispered his answer yes yes well $dickon$ will come to see you tomorrow morning and he ll bring his creatures with him
oh oh $mester_colin$ cried out in delight but that not all $mary_lennox$ went on almost pale with solemn excitement
the rest is better there is a door into the #garden# i found it it is under the ivy on the wall
if he had been a strong healthy boy $mester_colin$ would probably have shouted hooray hooray hooray but he was weak and rather hysterical his #eye# grew bigger and bigger and he gasped for breath
oh $mary_lennox$ he cried out with a half sob shall i see it shall i get into it
shall i live to get into it and he clutched her hands and dragged her toward him of #course# you ll see it snapped $mary_lennox$ indignantly
and she was so un hysterical and natural and childish that she brought him to his senses and he began to laugh at himself and a few minutes afterward
she was sitting on her stool again telling him not what she imagined the secret #garden# to be like but what it really was and $mester_colin$ aches and tiredness were forgotten
of #course# you ll live to get into it dont be silly and he was listening enraptured it is just what you thought it would be he said at last
it #sound# just as if you had really seen it you know i said that when you told me first
$mary_lennox$ hesitated about two minutes and then boldly spoke the truth i had seen it and i had been in she said
i found the key and got in weeks ago but i darent tell you i darent because i was so afraid i couldnt trust you for sure
#chapter# xix it has come of #course# dr $mr_archibald_craven$ had been sent for the morning after $mester_colin$ had had his tantrum
he was always sent for at once when such a #thing# occurred and he always found when he arrived a white shaken boy lying on his bed sulky and still so hysterical that he was ready to break into fresh sobbing at the least word
in fact dr $mr_archibald_craven$ dreaded and detested the difficulties of these visits on this occasion he was away from misselthwaite manor until afternoon
how is he he asked $mrs_medlock$ rather irritably when he arrived he will break a blood vessel in #one# of those fits some #day#
the boy is half insane with hysteria and self indulgence well sir answered $mrs_medlock$ you ll scarcely believe your #eye# when you see him
that plain sour faced child that almost as bad as himself has just bewitched him how she done it there no telling
the lord knows she nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear her speak but she did what none of us dare do
she just flew at him like a little cat last night and stamped her feet and ordered him to stop screaming and somehow she startled him so that he actually did stop and this afternoon well just come up and see sir
it past crediting the scene which dr $mr_archibald_craven$ beheld when he entered his patient room was indeed rather astonishing to him
$mester_colin$ was on his sofa in his dressing gown and he was sitting up quite straight looking at a picture in #one# of the #garden# books and talking to the plain child who at that moment could scarcely be called plain at all because her face was so glowing with enjoyment
as $mrs_medlock$ opened the door he heard laughing and chattering those long spires of blue #one# we ll have a lot of those $mester_colin$ was announcing
they re called del phin iums $dickon$ says they re larkspurs made big and grand cried mistress $mary_lennox$ there are clumps there already
then they saw dr $mr_archibald_craven$ and stopped $mary_lennox$ became quite still and $mester_colin$ looked fretful i am sorry to hear you were ill last night my boy dr $mr_archibald_craven$ said a trifle nervously
he was rather a nervous man i better now much better $mester_colin$ answered rather like a $rajah$ i going out in my chair in a #day# or two if it is fine
i want some fresh air dr $mr_archibald_craven$ sat down by him and felt his pulse and looked at him curiously
it must be a very fine #day# he said and you must be very careful not to tire yourself fresh air wont tire me said the young $rajah$
as there had been occasions when this same young gentleman had shrieked aloud with rage and had insisted that fresh air would give him cold and kill him it is not to be wondered at that his doctor felt somewhat startled
i thought you did not like fresh air he said i dont when i am by myself replied the $rajah$ but my cousin is going out with me
no i will not have the nurse so magnificently that $mary_lennox$ could not help remembering how the young native prince had looked with his diamonds and emeralds and pearls stuck all over him and the great rubies on the small dark hand he had waved to command his servants to approach with salaams and receive his orders
and the nurse of #course# suggested dr $mr_archibald_craven$ my cousin knows how to take care of me i am always better when she is with me
she made me better last night a very strong boy i know will push my #carriage# dr $mr_archibald_craven$ felt rather alarmed
he himself would lose all chance of inheriting misselthwaite but he was not an unscrupulous man though he was a weak #one# and he did not intend to let him run into actual danger
if this tiresome hysterical boy should chance to get well he must be a strong boy and a steady boy he said
and i must know something about him who is he what is his name it $dickon$ $mary_lennox$ spoke up suddenly
she felt somehow that everybody who knew the moor must know $dickon$ and she was right too she saw that in a moment dr $mr_archibald_craven$ serious face relaxed into a relieved smile
oh $dickon$ he said if it is $dickon$ you will be safe enough he as strong as a moor pony is $dickon$
and he trusty said $mary_lennox$ he th trustiest lad i $yorkshire$ she had been talking $yorkshire$ to $mester_colin$ and she forgot herself
did $dickon$ teach you that asked dr $mr_archibald_craven$ laughing outright i learning it as if it was french said $mary_lennox$ rather coldly
it like a native dialect in india very clever people try to learn them i like it and so does $mester_colin$
well well he said if it amuses you perhaps it wont do you any harm did you take your bromide last night $mester_colin$
no $mester_colin$ answered i wouldnt take it at first and after $mary_lennox$ made me quiet she talked me to sleep in a low voice about the spring creeping into a #garden#
that #sound# soothing said dr $mr_archibald_craven$ more perplexed than ever and glancing sideways at mistress $mary_lennox$ sitting on her stool and looking down silently at the carpet
you are evidently better but you must remember i dont want to remember interrupted the $rajah$ appearing again
when i lie by myself and remember i begin to have pains everywhere and i think of #thing# that make me begin to scream because i hate them so
if there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget you were ill instead of remembering it i would have him brought here
and he waved a thin hand which ought really to have been covered with royal signet rings made of rubies
dr $mr_archibald_craven$ had never made such a short stay after a tantrum usually he was obliged to remain a very long time and do a great many #thing#
it is because my cousin makes me forget that she makes me better this afternoon he did not give any medicine or leave any new orders and he was spared any disagreeable scenes
when he went downstairs he looked very thoughtful and when he talked to $mrs_medlock$ in the library she felt that he was a much puzzled man
well sir she ventured could you have believed it it is certainly a new state of affairs said the doctor
and there no denying it is better than the old #one# i believe $susan_sowerby$ right i do that said $mrs_medlock$
and she says to me well sarah ann she maynt be a good child an she maynt be a pretty #one# but she a child an children needs children
i stopped in her cottage on my way to thwaite yesterday and had a bit of talk with her we went to school together $susan_sowerby$ and me
she the best sick nurse i know said dr $mr_archibald_craven$ when i find her in a cottage i know the chances are that i shall save my patient
$mrs_medlock$ smiled she was fond of $susan_sowerby$ she got a way with her has $susan_sowerby$ she went on quite volubly
i ve been thinking all morning of #one# #thing# she said yesterday she says once when i was givin th children a bit of a preach after they been fightin
when i was at school my jography told as th #world# was shaped like a orange an i found out before i was ten that th whole orange doesnt belong to nobody
no #one# owns more than his bit of a quarter an there times it seems like there not enow quarters to go round
but dont you none you think as you own th whole orange or you ll find out you re mistaken an you wont find it out without hard knocks
i ses to em all what children learns from children she says is that there no sense in grabbin at th whole orange peel an all
if you do you ll likely not get even th pips an them too bitter to eat she a shrewd woman said dr $mr_archibald_craven$ putting on his coat
well she got a way of saying #thing# ended $mrs_medlock$ much pleased sometimes i ve said to her eh
$susan_sowerby$ if you was a different woman an didnt talk such broad $yorkshire$ i ve seen the times when i should have said you was clever
that night $mester_colin$ slept without once awakening and when he opened his #eye# in the morning he lay still and smiled without knowing it smiled because he felt so curiously comfortable
it was actually nice to be awake and he turned over and stretched his limbs luxuriously he felt as if tight strings which had held him had loosened themselves and let him go
he did not know that dr $mr_archibald_craven$ would have said that his nerves had relaxed and rested themselves instead of lying and staring at the wall and wishing
he had not awakened his mind was full of the plans he and $mary_lennox$ had made yesterday of pictures of the #garden# and of $dickon$ and his wild creatures
and he had not been awake more than ten minutes when he heard feet running along the corridor and $mary_lennox$ was at the door
the next minute she was in the room and had run across to his bed bringing with her a waft of fresh air full of the scent of the morning
it was so nice to have #thing# to think about you ve been out you ve been out there that nice smell of leaves
she had been running and her hair was loose and blown and she was bright with the air and pink cheeked though he could not see it
he cried it so beautiful she said a little breathless with her speed you never saw anything so beautiful
it has come i thought it had come that other morning but it was only coming it is here now it has come the spring
$dickon$ says so has it cried $mester_colin$ and though he really knew nothing about it he felt his heart beat
he actually sat up in bed open the window he added laughing half with joyful excitement and half at his own fancy
and though he laughed $mary_lennox$ was at the window in a moment and in a moment more it was opened wide and freshness and softness and scents and birds songs were pouring through
perhaps we may hear golden trumpets that fresh air she said lie on your back and draw in long breaths of it
he says he feels it in his veins and it makes him strong and he feels as if he could live forever and ever
that what $dickon$ does when he lying on the moor breathe it and breathe it she was only repeating what $dickon$ had told her but she caught $mester_colin$ fancy
he said and he did as she told him drawing in long deep breaths over and over again until he felt that something quite new and delightful was happening to him
forever and ever does it make him feel like that $mary_lennox$ was at his bedside again #thing# are crowding up out of the earth she ran on in a hurry
and there are flowers uncurling and buds on everything and the green veil has covered nearly all the gray and the birds are in such a hurry about their nests for fear they may be too late that some of them are even fighting for places in the secret #garden#
can be and there are primroses in the lanes and woods and the seeds we planted are up and $dickon$ has brought the fox and the crow and the squirrels and a new born lamb
the new born lamb $dickon$ had found three #day# before lying by its dead mother among the gorse bushes on the moor
and the rose bushes look as wick as wick and then she paused for breath it was not the first motherless lamb he had found and he knew what to do with it
he had taken it to the cottage wrapped in his jacket and he had let it lie near the fire and had fed it with warm milk
$dickon$ had carried it over the moor in his arms and its feeding bottle was in his pocket with a squirrel and when $mary_lennox$ had sat under a tree with its limp warmness huddled on her lap she had felt as if she were too full of strange joy to speak
it was a soft #thing# with a darling silly #baby# face and legs rather long for its body a lamb a lamb
she was describing it with great joy and $mester_colin$ was listening and drawing in long breaths of air when the nurse entered
a living lamb who lay on your lap like a #baby# she started a little at the sight of the open window
she had sat stifling in the room many a warm #day# because her patient was sure that open windows gave people cold
are you sure you are not chilly master $mester_colin$ she inquired no was the answer i am breathing long breaths of fresh air
it makes you strong i am going to get up to the sofa for breakfast my cousin will have breakfast with me
the nurse went away concealing a smile to give the order for two breakfasts she found the servants hall a more amusing place than the invalid chamber
there was a great deal of joking about the unpopular young recluse who as the cook said had found his master and good for him
the servants hall had been very tired of the tantrums and the butler who was a man with a family had more than once expressed his opinion that the invalid would be all the better for a good hiding
when $mester_colin$ was on his sofa and the breakfast for two was put upon the table he made an announcement to the nurse in his most $rajah$ like manner
a boy and a fox and a crow and two squirrels and a new born lamb are coming to see me this morning
and just now everybody wanted to hear the news from upstairs i want them brought upstairs as soon as they come he said
you are not to begin playing with the animals in the servants hall and keep them there i want them here
the nurse gave a slight gasp and tried to conceal it with a cough yes sir she answered
i ll tell you what you can do added $mester_colin$ waving his hand you can tell $martha$ to bring them here
the boy is $martha$ brother his name is $dickon$ and he is an animal charmer i hope the animals wont bite master $mester_colin$ said the nurse
i told you he was a charmer said $mester_colin$ austerely charmers animals never bite there are snake charmers in india said $mary_lennox$
and they can put their snakes heads in their mouths goodness shuddered the nurse they ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring in upon them
$mester_colin$ breakfast was a very good #one# and $mary_lennox$ watched him with serious interest you will begin to get fatter just as i did she said
i never wanted my breakfast when i was in india and now i always want it i wanted mine this morning said $mester_colin$
perhaps it was the fresh air when do you think $dickon$ will come he was not long in coming
in about ten minutes $mary_lennox$ held up her hand listen she said did you hear a caw $mester_colin$ listened and heard it the oddest #sound# in the #world# to hear inside a house a hoarse caw caw
yes he answered that soot said $mary_lennox$ listen again do you hear a bleat a tiny #one# oh yes
$dickon$ moorland boots were thick and clumsy and though he tried to walk quietly they made a clumping #sound# as he walked through the long corridors
$mary_lennox$ and $mester_colin$ heard him marching marching until he passed through the tapestry door on to the soft carpet of $mester_colin$ own passage
cried $mester_colin$ quite flushing that the new born lamb said $mary_lennox$ he coming if you please sir announced $martha$ opening the door if you please sir here $dickon$
an his creatures $dickon$ came in smiling his nicest wide smile the new born lamb was in his arms and the little red fox trotted by his side
nut sat on his left shoulder and soot on his right and $shell$ head and paws peeped out of his coat pocket
$mester_colin$ slowly sat up and stared and stared as he had stared when he first saw $mary_lennox$ but this was a stare of wonder and delight
the truth was that in spite of all he had heard he had not in the least understood what this boy would be like and that his fox and his crow and his squirrels and his lamb were so near to him and his friendliness that they seemed almost to be part of himself
$mester_colin$ had never talked to a boy in his life and he was so overwhelmed by his own pleasure and curiosity that he did not even think of speaking
he had not felt embarrassed because the crow had not known his language and had only stared and had not spoken to him the first time they met
but $dickon$ did not feel the least shy or awkward creatures were always like that until they found out about you
he walked over to $mester_colin$ sofa and put the new born lamb quietly on his lap and immediately the little creature turned to the warm velvet dressing gown and began to nuzzle and nuzzle into its folds and butt its tight curled head with soft impatience against his side
of #course# no boy could have helped speaking then what is it doing cried $mester_colin$ what does it want
it wants its mother said $dickon$ smiling more and more i brought it to thee a bit hungry because i knowed #tha# like to see it feed
he knelt down by the sofa and took a feeding bottle from his pocket come on little un he said turning the small woolly white head with a gentle brown hand
there now and he pushed the rubber tip of the bottle into the nuzzling mouth and the lamb began to suck it with ravenous ecstasy
this is what #tha# after #tha# ll get more out this than #tha# will out silk velvet coats after that there was no wondering what to say
by the time the lamb fell asleep questions poured forth and $dickon$ answered them all he told them how he had found the lamb just as the sun was rising three mornings ago
he had been standing on the moor listening to a skylark and watching him swing higher and higher into the sky until he was only a speck in the heights of blue
i almost lost him but for his song an i was wonderin how a chap could hear it when it seemed as if he get out th #world# in a minute
an just then i heard somethin else far off among th gorse bushes it was a weak bleatin an i knowed it was a new lamb as was hungry an
i knowed it wouldnt be hungry if it hadnt lost its mother somehow so i set off searchin eh i did have a look for it
i went in an out among th gorse bushes an round an round an i always seemed to take th wrong turnin
but at last i seed a bit white by a rock on top th moor an i climbed up an found th little un half dead wi cold an clemmin
while he talked soot flew solemnly in and out of the open window and cawed remarks about the scenery while nut and $shell$ made excursions into the big trees outside and ran up and down trunks and explored branches
they looked at the pictures in the gardening books and $dickon$ knew all the flowers by their country names and knew exactly which #one# were already growing in the secret #garden#
i couldna say that there name he said pointing to #one# under which was written aquilegia but us calls that a columbine an that there #one# it a snapdragon and they both grow wild in hedges but these is #garden# #one# an they re bigger an grander
captain curled up near $dickon$ who sat on the hearth rug from preference there some big clumps columbine in th #garden#
they ll look like a bed blue an white butterflies flutterin when they re out i going to see them cried $mester_colin$
i am going to see them aye that #tha# mun said $mary_lennox$ quite seriously an #tha# munnot lose no time about it
#chapter# xx i shall live forever and ever and ever but they were obliged to wait more than a week because first there came some very windy #day#
and then $mester_colin$ was threatened with a cold which two #thing# happening #one# after the other would no doubt have thrown him into a rage but
that there was so much careful and mysterious planning to do and almost every #day# $dickon$ came in if only for a few minutes to talk about what was happening on the moor and in the lanes and hedges and on the borders of streams
the #thing# he had to tell about otters and badgers and water rats houses not to mention birds nests and field mice and their burrows were enough to make you almost tremble with excitement when you heard all the intimate details from an animal charmer and realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety the whole busy underworld was working
they re same as us said $dickon$ only they have to build their homes every year an it keeps em so busy they fair scuffle to get em done
the most absorbing #thing# however was the preparations to be made before $mester_colin$ could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the #garden#
no #one# must see the chair #carriage# and $dickon$ and $mary_lennox$ after they turned a certain corner of the shrubbery and entered upon the walk outside the ivied walls
as each #day# passed $mester_colin$ had become more and more fixed in his feeling that the mystery surrounding the #garden# was #one# of its greatest charms
people must think that he was simply going out with $mary_lennox$ and $dickon$ because he liked them and did not object to their looking at him
nothing must spoil that no #one# must ever suspect that they had a secret they had long and quite delightful talks about their route
they would go up this path and down that #one# and cross the other and go round among the fountain flower beds as if they were looking at the bedding out plants the head gardener $mr_roach$ had been having arranged
that would seem such a rational #thing# to do that no #one# would think it at all mysterious they would turn into the shrubbery walks and lose themselves until they came to the long walls
it was almost as serious and elaborately thought out as the plans of march made by great generals in time of war
rumors of the new and curious #thing# which were occurring in the invalid apartments had of #course# filtered through the servants hall into the stable yards and out among the gardeners but notwithstanding this $mr_roach$ was startled #one# #day# when he received orders from master $mester_colin$ room to the effect that he must report himself in the apartment no outsider had ever seen as the invalid himself desired to speak to him
well well he said to himself as he hurriedly changed his coat what to do now his royal highness that wasnt to be looked at calling up a man he never set #eye# on
he had never caught even a glimpse of the boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his uncanny looks and ways and his insane tempers
the #thing# he had heard oftenest was that he might die at any moment and there had been numerous fanciful descriptions of a humped back and helpless limbs given by people who had never seen him
#thing# are changing in this house $mr_roach$ said $mrs_medlock$ as she led him up the back staircase to the corridor on to which opened the hitherto mysterious chamber
$mr_roach$ was not without curiosity let hope they re changing for the better $mrs_medlock$ he answered
they couldnt well change for the worse she continued and queer as it all is there them as finds their duties made a lot easier to stand up under
dont you be surprised $mr_roach$ if you find yourself in the middle of a menagerie and $martha$ $susan_sowerby$ $dickon$ more at home than you or me could ever be
there really was a sort of $magic$ about $dickon$ as $mary_lennox$ always privately believed when $mr_roach$ heard his name he smiled quite leniently
he be at home in buckingham palace or at the bottom of a coal mine he said and yet it not impudence either
he just fine is that lad it was perhaps well he had been prepared or he might have been startled
when the bedroom door was opened a large crow which seemed quite at home perched on the high back of a carven chair announced the entrance of a visitor by saying caw caw quite loudly
in spite of $mrs_medlock$ warning $mr_roach$ only just escaped being sufficiently undignified to jump backward the young $rajah$ was neither in bed nor on his sofa
he was sitting in an armchair and a young lamb was standing by him shaking its tail in feeding lamb fashion as $dickon$ knelt giving it milk from its bottle
a squirrel was perched on $dickon$ bent back attentively nibbling a nut the little girl from india was sitting on a big footstool looking on
here is $mr_roach$ master $mester_colin$ said $mrs_medlock$ the young $rajah$ turned and looked his servitor over at least that was what the head gardener felt happened
oh you are $mr_roach$ are you he said i sent for you to give you some very important orders
very good sir answered $mr_roach$ wondering if he was to receive instructions to fell all the oaks in the park or to transform the orchards into water #garden#
i am going out in my chair this afternoon said $mester_colin$ if the fresh air agrees with me i may go out every #day#
when i go none of the gardeners are to be anywhere near the long walk by the #garden# walls no #one# is to be there
i shall go out about two clock and everyone must keep away until i send word that they may go back to their work
very good sir replied $mr_roach$ much relieved to hear that the oaks might remain and that the orchards were safe
$mary_lennox$ said $mester_colin$ turning to her what is that #thing# you say in india when you have finished talking and want people to go
you say you have my permission to go answered $mary_lennox$ the $rajah$ waved his hand you have my permission to go $mr_roach$ he said
but remember this is very important caw caw remarked the crow hoarsely but not impolitely very good sir thank you sir said $mr_roach$ and $mrs_medlock$ took him out of the room
outside in the corridor being a rather good natured man he smiled until he almost laughed my word he said he got a fine lordly way with him hasnt he
eh protested $mrs_medlock$ we ve had to let him trample all over every #one# of us ever since he had feet
you think he was a whole royal family rolled into #one# prince consort and all and he thinks that what folks was born for
perhaps he ll grow out of it if he lives suggested $mr_roach$ well there #one# #thing# pretty sure said $mrs_medlock$
if he does live and that indian child stays here i ll warrant she teaches him that the whole orange does not belong to him as $susan_sowerby$ says
and he ll be likely to find out the size of his own quarter inside the room $mester_colin$ was leaning back on his cushions
it all safe now he said and this afternoon i shall see it this afternoon i shall be in it
$dickon$ went back to the #garden# with his creatures and $mary_lennox$ stayed with $mester_colin$ she did not think he looked tired
but he was very quiet before their lunch came and he was quiet while they were eating it she wondered why and asked him about it
what big #eye# you ve got $mester_colin$ she said when you are thinking they get as big as saucers what are you thinking about now
i cant help thinking about what it will look like he answered the #garden# asked $mary_lennox$ the springtime he said
i was thinking that i ve really never seen it before i scarcely ever went out and when i did go i never looked at it
shut in and morbid as his life had been $mester_colin$ had more imagination than she had and at least he had spent a good deal of time looking at wonderful books and pictures
i didnt even think about it i never saw it in india because there wasnt any said $mary_lennox$ that morning when you ran in and said it come
it come you made me feel quite queer it sounded as if #thing# were coming with a great procession and big bursts and wafts of music
i ve a picture like it in #one# of my books crowds of lovely people and children with garlands and branches with blossoms on them everyone laughing and dancing and crowding and playing on pipes
that was why i said perhaps we shall hear golden trumpets and told you to throw open the window how funny said $mary_lennox$
and if all the flowers and leaves and green #thing# and birds and wild creatures danced past at once what a crowd it would be
that really just what it feels like i sure they dance and sing and flute and that would be the wafts of music
they both laughed but it was not because the idea was laughable but because they both so liked it a little later the nurse made $mester_colin$ ready
she noticed that instead of lying like a log while his clothes were put on he sat up and made some efforts to help himself and he talked and laughed with $mary_lennox$ all the time
this is #one# of his good #day# sir she said to dr $mr_archibald_craven$ who dropped in to inspect him
he in such good spirits that it makes him stronger i ll call in again later in the afternoon after he has come in said dr $mr_archibald_craven$
i must see how the going out agrees with him i wish in a very low voice that he would let you go with him
i rather give up the case this moment sir than even stay here while it suggested answered the nurse with sudden firmness
i hadnt really decided to suggest it said the doctor with his slight nervousness we ll try the experiment $dickon$ a lad
the strongest footman in the house carried $mester_colin$ down stairs and put him in his wheeled chair near which $dickon$ waited outside
i trust with a new born child after the manservant had arranged his rugs and cushions the $rajah$ waved his hand to him and to the nurse
you have my permission to go he said and they both disappeared quickly and it must be confessed giggled when they were safely inside the house
$dickon$ began to push the wheeled chair slowly and steadily mistress $mary_lennox$ walked beside it and $mester_colin$ leaned back and lifted his face to the sky
the arch of it looked very high and the small snowy clouds seemed like white birds floating on outspread wings below its crystal blueness
$mester_colin$ kept lifting his thin chest to draw it in and his big #eye# looked as if it were they which were listening listening instead of his ears
the wind swept in soft big breaths down from the moor and was strange with a wild clear scented sweetness
there are so many #sound# of singing and humming and calling out he said what is that scent the puffs of wind bring
it gorse on th moor that openin out answered $dickon$ eh th bees are at it wonderful today
not a human creature was to be caught sight of in the paths they took in fact every gardener or gardener lad had been witched away
but they wound in and out among the shrubbery and out and round the fountain beds following their carefully planned route for the mere mysterious pleasure of it
but when at last they turned into the long walk by the ivied walls the excited sense of an approaching thrill made them for some curious reason they could not have explained begin to speak in whispers
this is it breathed $mary_lennox$ this is where i used to walk up and down and wonder and wonder
is it cried $mester_colin$ and his #eye# began to search the ivy with eager curiousness but i can see nothing he whispered
there is no door that what i thought said $mary_lennox$ then there was a lovely breathless silence and the chair wheeled on
that is the #garden# where $ben_weatherstaff$ works said $mary_lennox$ is it said $mester_colin$ a few yards more and $mary_lennox$ whispered again
this is where the robin flew over the wall she said is it cried $mester_colin$ oh i wish he come again
and that said $mary_lennox$ with solemn delight pointing under a big lilac bush is where he perched on the little heap of earth and showed me the key
he cried and his #eye# were as big as the wolf in red riding hood when red riding hood felt called upon to remark on them
and this said $mary_lennox$ stepping on to the bed close to the ivy is where i went to talk to him when he chirped at me from the top of the wall
then $mester_colin$ sat up where where there $dickon$ stood still and the wheeled chair stopped and this is the ivy the wind blew back and she took hold of the hanging green curtain
oh is it is it gasped $mester_colin$ and here is the handle and here is the door $dickon$ push him in push him in quickly
but $mester_colin$ had actually dropped back against his cushions even though he gasped with delight and he had covered his #eye# with his hands and held them there shutting out everything until they were inside and the chair stopped as if by $magic$ and the door was closed
not till then did he take them away and look round and round and round as $dickon$ and $mary_lennox$ had done
and over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays and tendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had crept and in the grass under the trees and the gray urns in the alcoves and here
and there everywhere were touches or splashes of gold and purple and white and the trees were showing pink and snow above his head and there were fluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents and scents
and $dickon$ did it with #one# strong steady splendid push and the sun fell warm upon his face like a hand with a lovely touch
he looked so strange and different because a pink glow of #color# had actually crept all over him ivory face and neck and hands and all
and in wonder $mary_lennox$ and $dickon$ stood and stared at him i shall get well i shall get well he cried out
#chapter# xxi $ben_weatherstaff$ #one# of the strange #thing# about living in the #world# is that it is only now and then #one# is quite sure #one# is going to live forever and ever and ever
#one# knows it sometimes when #one# gets up at the tender solemn dawn time and goes out and stands alone and throws #one# head far back and looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing and flushing and marvelous unknown #thing# happening until the east almost makes #one# cry out and #one# heart stands still at the strange unchanging majesty of the rising of the sun which has been happening every morning for thousands and thousands and thousands of years
$mary_lennox$ $dickon$ i shall get well and i shall live forever and ever and ever #one# knows it then for a moment or so
and #one# knows it sometimes when #one# stands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold stillness slanting through and under the branches seems to be saying slowly again and again something #one# cannot quite hear however much #one# tries
then sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night with millions of stars waiting and watching makes #one# sure and sometimes a #sound# of far off music makes it true and sometimes a look in some #one# #eye#
and it was like that with $mester_colin$ when he first saw and heard and felt the springtime inside the four high walls of a hidden #garden#
that afternoon the whole #world# seemed to devote itself to being perfect and radiantly beautiful and kind to #one# boy perhaps out of pure heavenly goodness the spring came and crowned everything it possibly could into that #one# place
more than once $dickon$ paused in what he was doing and stood still with a sort of growing wonder in his #eye# shaking his head softly
i twelve goin on thirteen an there a lot afternoons in thirteen years but seems to me like i never seed #one# as graidely as this ere
eh it is graidely he said aye it is a graidely #one# said $mary_lennox$ and she sighed for mere joy
i ll warrant it the graidelest #one# as ever was in this #world# does #tha# think said $mester_colin$ with dreamy carefulness as happen it was made loike this
ere all purpose for me my word cried $mary_lennox$ admiringly that there is a bit good $yorkshire$ #tha# rt shapin first rate that #tha# art
and delight reigned they drew the chair under the plum tree which was snow white with blossoms and musical with bees it was like a king canopy a fairy king
there were flowering cherry trees near and apple trees whose buds were pink and white and here and there #one# had burst open wide
between the blossoming branches of the canopy bits of blue sky looked down like wonderful #eye# $mary_lennox$ and $dickon$ worked a little here
they brought him #thing# to look at buds which were opening buds which were tight closed bits of twig whose leaves were just showing green the feather of a woodpecker which had dropped on the grass the empty $shell$ of some bird early hatched
$dickon$ pushed the chair slowly round and round the #garden# stopping every other moment to let him look at wonders springing out of the earth or trailing down from trees
it was like being taken in state round the country of a $magic$ king and queen and shown all the mysterious riches it contained
and there and $mester_colin$ watched them i wonder if we shall see the robin said $mester_colin$ #tha# ll see him often enow after a bit answered $dickon$
when th eggs hatches out th little chap he ll be kep so busy it ll make his head swim #tha# ll see him flyin
backward an for ard carryin worms nigh as big as himsel an that much noise goin on in th nest when he gets there as fair flusters him so as he scarce knows which big mouth to drop th first piece in
mother says as when she sees th work a robin has to keep them gapin beaks filled she feels like she was a lady with nothin to do
she says she seen th little chaps when it seemed like th sweat must be droppin off em though folk cant see it
this made them giggle so delightedly that they were obliged to cover their mouths with their hands remembering that they must not be heard
an gapin beaks an squawks on every side $mester_colin$ had been instructed as to the law of whispers and low voices several #day# before
he liked the mysteriousness of it and did his best but in the midst of excited enjoyment it is rather difficult never to laugh above a whisper
the wheeled chair had been drawn back under the canopy and $dickon$ had sat down on the grass and had just drawn out his pipe when $mester_colin$ saw something he had not had time to notice before
every moment of the afternoon was full of new #thing# and every hour the sunshine grew more golden that a very old tree over there isnt it
he said $dickon$ looked across the grass at the tree and $mary_lennox$ looked and there was a brief moment of stillness
yes answered $dickon$ after it and his low voice had a very gentle #sound# $mary_lennox$ gazed at the tree and thought
the branches are quite gray and there not a single leaf anywhere $mester_colin$ went on it quite dead isnt it
but them roses as has climbed all over it will near hide every bit th dead wood when they re full leaves an flowers
aye admitted $dickon$ it wont look dead then it ll be th prettiest of all $mary_lennox$ still gazed at the tree and thought
it looks as if a big branch had been broken off said $mester_colin$ i wonder how it was done
it been done many a year answered $dickon$ eh with a sudden relieved start and laying his hand on $mester_colin$
$mester_colin$ was almost too late but he just caught sight of him the flash of red breasted bird with something in his beak
look at that robin there he is he been foragin for his mate he darted through the greenness and into the close grown corner and was out of sight
$mester_colin$ leaned back on his cushion again laughing a little he taking her tea to her perhaps it five clock
i think i like some tea myself and so they were safe it was $magic$ which sent the robin said $mary_lennox$ secretly to $dickon$ afterward
for both she and $dickon$ had been afraid $mester_colin$ might ask something about the tree whose branch had broken off ten years ago and they had talked it over together
i know it was $magic$ and $dickon$ had stood and rubbed his head in a troubled way we mun look as if it wasnt no different from th other trees he had said
we couldnt never tell him how it broke poor lad if he says anything about it we mun we mun try to look cheerful
aye that we mun had answered $mary_lennox$ but she had not felt as if she looked cheerful when she gazed at the tree
he had gone on rubbing his rust red hair in a puzzled way but a nice comforted look had begun to grow in his blue #eye#
she wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was any reality in that other #thing# $dickon$ had said
she thinks maybe she about misselthwaite many a time lookin after $mester_colin$ same as all mothers do when they re took out th #world#
mrs $mr_archibald_craven$ was a very lovely young lady he had gone on rather hesitatingly an mother they have to come back #tha# sees
happen she been in the #garden# an happen it was her set us to work an told us to bring him here
$mary_lennox$ had thought he meant something about $magic$ she was a great believer in $magic$ secretly she quite believed that $dickon$ worked $magic$ of #course# good $magic$ on everything near him
she wondered indeed if it were not possible that his gift had brought the robin just at the right moment when $mester_colin$ asked that dangerous question
and that was why people liked him so much and wild creatures knew he was their friend she felt that his $magic$ was working all the afternoon and making $mester_colin$ look like an entirely different boy
it did not seem possible that he could be the crazy creature who had screamed and beaten and bitten his pillow
the faint glow of #color# which had shown on his face and neck and hands when he first got inside the #garden# really never quite died away
even his ivory whiteness seemed to change he looked as if he were made of flesh instead of ivory or wax
they saw the robin carry food to his mate two or three times and it was so suggestive of afternoon tea that $mester_colin$ felt they must have some
go and make #one# of the men servants bring some in a basket to the rhododendron walk he said and then you and $dickon$ can bring it here
it was an agreeable idea easily carried out and when the white cloth was spread upon the grass with hot tea and buttered toast and crumpets a delightfully hungry meal was eaten and several birds on domestic errands paused to inquire what was going on and were led into investigating crumbs with great activity
nut and $shell$ whisked up trees with pieces of cake and soot took the entire half of a buttered crumpet into a corner and pecked at and examined and turned it over and made hoarse remarks about it until he decided to swallow it all joyfully in #one# gulp
the sun was deepening the gold of its lances the bees were going home and the birds were flying past less often
$dickon$ and $mary_lennox$ were sitting on the grass the tea basket was repacked ready to be taken back to the house and $mester_colin$ was lying against his cushions with his heavy locks pushed back from his forehead and his face looking quite a natural #color#
the afternoon was dragging towards its mellow hour i dont want this afternoon to go he said but i shall come back tomorrow and the #day# after and the #day# after and the #day# after
you ll get plenty of fresh air wont you said $mary_lennox$ i going to get nothing else he answered
i ve seen the spring now and i going to see the summer i going to see everything grow here i going to grow here myself
that #tha# will said $dickon$ us ll have thee walkin about here an diggin same as other folk afore long
$mester_colin$ flushed tremendously walk he said dig shall i $dickon$ glance at him was delicately cautious neither he nor $mary_lennox$ had ever asked if anything was the matter with his legs
for sure #tha# will he said stoutly #tha# #tha# got legs thine own same as other folks $mary_lennox$ was rather frightened until she heard $mester_colin$ answer
nothing really ails them he said but they are so thin and weak they shake so that i afraid to try to stand on them
both $mary_lennox$ and $dickon$ drew a relieved breath when #tha# stops bein afraid #tha# lt stand on em $dickon$ said with renewed cheer
an #tha# lt stop bein afraid in a bit i shall said $mester_colin$ and he lay still as if he were wondering about #thing#
they were really very quiet for a little while the sun was dropping lower it was that hour when everything stills itself and they really had had a busy and exciting afternoon
$mester_colin$ looked as if he were resting luxuriously even the creatures had ceased moving about and had drawn together and were resting near them
soot had perched on a low branch and drawn up #one# leg and dropped the gray film drowsily over his #eye#
in the midst of this stillness it was rather startling when $mester_colin$ half lifted his head and exclaimed in a loud suddenly alarmed whisper
$mary_lennox$ privately thought he looked as if he might snore in a minute who is that man $dickon$ and $mary_lennox$ scrambled to their feet
man they both cried in low quick voices $mester_colin$ pointed to the high wall look he whispered excitedly just look
$mary_lennox$ and $dickon$ wheeled about and looked there was $ben_weatherstaff$ indignant face glaring at them over the wall from the top of a ladder
he actually shook his fist at $mary_lennox$ if i wasnt a bachelder an #tha# was a wench mine he cried i give thee a hidin
he mounted another step threateningly as if it were his energetic intention to jump down and deal with her but as she came toward him he evidently thought better of it and stood on the top step of his ladder shaking his fist down at her
i never thowt much thee he harangued i couldna abide thee th first time i set #eye# on thee
a scrawny buttermilk faced young besom allus askin questions an pokin #tha# nose where it wasna wanted i never knowed how #tha# got so thick
wi me if it hadna been for th robin drat him $ben_weatherstaff$ called out $mary_lennox$ finding her breath she stood below him and called up to him with a sort of gasp
then it did seem as if $ben_weatherstaff$ really would scramble down on her side of the wall he was so outraged
$ben_weatherstaff$ it was the robin who showed me the way #tha# young bad un he called down at her
layin #tha# badness on a robin not but what he impidint enow for anythin him showin thee th way him eh
#tha# young nowt she could see his next words burst out because he was overpowered by curiosity however i this #world# did #tha# get in
it was the robin who showed me the way she protested obstinately he didnt know he was doing it
he stopped shaking his fist very suddenly at that very moment and his jaw actually dropped as he stared over her head at something he saw coming over the grass toward him
at the first #sound# of his torrent of words $mester_colin$ had been so surprised that he had only sat up and listened as if he were spellbound
but he did and i cant tell you from here while you re shaking your fist at me but in the midst of it he had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously to $dickon$
wheel me over there he commanded wheel me quite close and stop right in front of him and this if you please this is what $ben_weatherstaff$ beheld and which made his jaw drop
a wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robes which came toward him looking rather like some sort of state coach because a young $rajah$ leaned back in it with royal command in his great black rimmed #eye# and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him
and it stopped right under $ben_weatherstaff$ nose it was really no wonder his mouth dropped open do you know who i am demanded the $rajah$
how $ben_weatherstaff$ stared his red old #eye# fixed themselves on what was before him as if he were seeing a ghost
he gazed and gazed and gulped a lump down his throat and did not say a word do you know who i am
demanded $mester_colin$ still more imperiously answer $ben_weatherstaff$ put his gnarled hand up and passed it over his #eye# and over his forehead
and then he did answer in a queer shaky voice who #tha# art he said aye that i do wi #tha# mother #eye# starin at me out #tha# face
lord knows how #tha# come here but #tha# rt th poor cripple $mester_colin$ forgot that he had ever had a back
his face flushed scarlet and he sat bolt upright i not a cripple he cried out furiously i not
he not cried $mary_lennox$ almost shouting up the wall in her fierce indignation he not got a lump as big as a pin
i looked and there was none there not #one# $ben_weatherstaff$ passed his hand over his forehead again and gazed as if he could never gaze enough
he was an ignorant old man and a tactless old man and he could only remember the #thing# he had heard
his hand shook and his mouth shook and his voice shook #tha# #tha# hasnt got a crooked back he said hoarsely
no shouted $mester_colin$ #tha# #tha# hasnt got crooked legs quavered $ben_weatherstaff$ more hoarsely yet it was too much the strength which $mester_colin$ usually threw into his tantrums rushed through him now in a new way
never yet had he been accused of crooked legs even in whispers and the perfectly simple belief in their existence which was revealed by $ben_weatherstaff$ voice was more than $rajah$ flesh and blood could endure
his anger and insulted pride made him forget everything but this #one# moment and filled him with a power he had never known before an almost unnatural strength
come here he shouted to $dickon$ and he actually began to tear the coverings off his lower limbs and disentangle himself
come here come here this minute $dickon$ was by his side in a second $mary_lennox$ caught her breath in a short gasp and felt herself turn pale
he can do it he can do it he can do it he can she gabbled over to herself under her breath as fast as ever she could
there was a brief fierce scramble the rugs were tossed on the ground $dickon$ held $mester_colin$ arm the thin legs were out the thin feet were on the grass
$mester_colin$ was standing upright upright as straight as an arrow and looking strangely tall his head thrown back and his strange #eye# flashing lightning
look at me he flung up at $ben_weatherstaff$ just look at me you just look at me he as straight as i am cried $dickon$
he as straight as any lad i $yorkshire$ what $ben_weatherstaff$ did $mary_lennox$ thought queer beyond measure he choked and gulped and suddenly tears ran down his weather wrinkled cheeks as he struck his old hands together
eh he burst forth th lies folk tells #tha# rt as thin as a lath an as white as a wraith but there not a knob on thee
#tha# lt make a mon yet god bless thee $dickon$ held $mester_colin$ arm strongly but the boy had not begun to falter
he stood straighter and straighter and looked $ben_weatherstaff$ in the face i your master he said when my father is away
you get down from that ladder and go out to the long walk and miss $mary_lennox$ will meet you and bring you here
and you are to obey me this is my #garden# dont dare to say a word about it i want to talk to you
we did not want you but now you will have to be in the secret be quick $ben_weatherstaff$ crabbed old face was still wet with that #one# queer rush of tears
it seemed as if he could not take his #eye# from thin straight $mester_colin$ standing on his feet with his head thrown back
eh lad he almost whispered eh my lad and then remembering himself he suddenly touched his hat gardener fashion and said yes sir
yes sir and obediently disappeared as he descended the ladder #chapter# xxii when the sun went down when his head was out of sight $mester_colin$ turned to $mary_lennox$
go and meet him he said and $mary_lennox$ flew across the grass to the door under the ivy $dickon$ was watching him with sharp #eye#
there were scarlet spots on his cheeks and he looked amazing but he showed no signs of falling i can stand he said and his head was still held up and he said it quite grandly
i told thee #tha# could as soon as #tha# stopped bein afraid answered $dickon$ an #tha# stopped
yes i ve stopped said $mester_colin$ then suddenly he remembered something $mary_lennox$ had said are you making $magic$ he asked sharply
it same $magic$ as made these ere work out th earth and he touched with his thick boot a clump of crocuses in the grass
$dickon$ curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin #tha# doin $magic$ thysel he said $mester_colin$ looked down at them
aye he said slowly there couldna be bigger $magic$ than that there there couldna be he drew himself up straighter than ever
i going to walk to that tree he said pointing to #one# a few feet away from him i going to be standing when $ben_weatherstaff$ comes here
i can rest against the tree if i like when i want to sit down i will sit down but not before
bring a rug from the chair he walked to the tree and though $dickon$ held his arm he was wonderfully steady
when he stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain that he supported himself against it and he still held himself so straight that he looked tall
when $ben_weatherstaff$ came through the door in the wall he saw him standing there and he heard $mary_lennox$ muttering something under her breath
he asked rather testily because he did not want his attention distracted from the long thin straight boy figure and proud face
what art sayin but she did not tell him what she was saying was this you can do it
she was saying it to $mester_colin$ because she wanted to make $magic$ and keep him on his feet looking like that
you can do it i told you you could you can do it you can do it you can she could not bear that he should give in before $ben_weatherstaff$
he did not give in she was uplifted by a sudden feeling that he looked quite beautiful in spite of his thinness
he fixed his #eye# on $ben_weatherstaff$ in his funny imperious way look at me he commanded look at me all over
$ben_weatherstaff$ had not quite got over his emotion but he had recovered a little and answered almost in his usual way
am i a hunchback have i got crooked legs not #tha# he said nowt th sort what #tha# been doin with thysel hidin out sight
an lettin folk think #tha# was cripple an half witted half witted said $mester_colin$ angrily who thought that lots fools said $ben_weatherstaff$
th #world# full jackasses brayin an they never bray nowt but lies what did #tha# shut thysel up for
everyone thought i was going to die said $mester_colin$ shortly i not and he said it with such decision $ben_weatherstaff$ looked him over up and down down and up
#tha# die he said with dry exultation nowt th sort #tha# got too much pluck in thee
when i seed thee put #tha# legs on th ground in such a hurry i knowed #tha# was all right sit thee down on th rug
a bit young $mester_colin$ an give me thy orders there was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd understanding in his manner
$mary_lennox$ had poured out speech as rapidly as she could as they had come down the long walk the chief #thing# to be remembered she had told him was that $mester_colin$ was getting well getting well
the #garden# was doing it no #one# must let him remember about having humps and dying the $rajah$ condescended to seat himself on a rug under the tree
what work do you do in the #garden# $ben_weatherstaff$ he inquired anythin i told to do answered old $ben_weatherstaff$
i kep on by favor because she liked me she said $mester_colin$ #tha# mother answered $ben_weatherstaff$ my mother said $mester_colin$ and he looked about him quietly
this was her #garden# wasnt it aye it was that and $ben_weatherstaff$ looked about him too she were main fond of it
it is my #garden# now i am fond of it i shall come here every #day# announced $mester_colin$ but it is to be a secret
my orders are that no #one# is to know that we come here $dickon$ and my cousin have worked and made it come alive
i shall send for you sometimes to help but you must come when no #one# can see you $ben_weatherstaff$ face twisted itself in a dry old smile
i ve come here before when no #one# saw me he said what exclaimed $mester_colin$ when th last time i was here rubbing his chin and looking round was about two year ago
but no #one# has been in it for ten years cried $mester_colin$ there was no door i no #one# said old $ben_weatherstaff$ dryly
an i didnt come through th door i come over th wall th rheumatics held me back th last two year
#tha# come an did a bit prunin cried $dickon$ i couldnt make out how it had been done
she was so fond of it she was said $ben_weatherstaff$ slowly an she was such a pretty young #thing#
she says to me once $ben_weatherstaff$ says she laughin if ever i ill or if i go away you must take care of my roses
when she did go away th orders was no #one# was ever to come nigh but i come with grumpy obstinacy
over th wall i come until th rheumatics stopped me an i did a bit work once a year she gave her order first
it wouldnt have been as wick as it is if #tha# hadnt done it said $dickon$ i did wonder
i glad you did it $ben_weatherstaff$ said $mester_colin$ you ll know how to keep the secret aye i ll know sir answered $ben_weatherstaff$
an it ll be easier for a man wi rheumatics to come in at th door on the grass near the tree $mary_lennox$ had dropped her trowel
$mester_colin$ stretched out his hand and took it up an odd #expression# came into his face and he began to scratch at the earth
his thin hand was weak enough but presently as they watched him $mary_lennox$ with quite breathless interest he drove the end of the trowel into the soil and turned some over
you can do it you can do it said $mary_lennox$ to herself i tell you you can $dickon$ round #eye# were full of eager curiousness but he said not a word
$ben_weatherstaff$ looked on with interested face $mester_colin$ persevered after he had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he spoke exultantly to $dickon$ in his best $yorkshire$
#tha# said as #tha# have me walkin about here same as other folk an #tha# said #tha# have me diggin i thowt #tha# was just leein to please me
this is only th first #day# an i ve walked an here i am diggin $ben_weatherstaff$ mouth fell open again when he heard him but he ended by chuckling
eh he said that #sound# as if #tha# got wits enow #tha# rt a $yorkshire$ lad for sure an #tha# rt diggin too
how #tha# like to plant a bit somethin i can get thee a rose in a pot go and get it said $mester_colin$ digging excitedly
$dickon$ took his spade and dug the hole deeper and wider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it
quick quick it was done quickly enough indeed $ben_weatherstaff$ went his way forgetting rheumatics $mary_lennox$ slipped out to run and bring back a watering can
when $dickon$ had deepened the hole $mester_colin$ went on turning the soft earth over and over he looked up at the sky flushed and glowing with the strangely new exercise slight as it was
i want to do it before the sun goes quite quite down he said $mary_lennox$ thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just on purpose
$ben_weatherstaff$ brought the rose in its pot from the greenhouse he hobbled over the grass as fast as he could
he had begun to be excited too he knelt down by the hole and broke the pot from the mould
here lad he said handing the plant to $mester_colin$ set it in the earth thysel same as th king does when he goes to a new place
the thin white hands shook a little and $mester_colin$ flush grew deeper as he set the rose in the mould and held it while old $ben_weatherstaff$ made firm the earth
it was filled in and pressed down and made steady $mary_lennox$ was leaning forward on her hands and knees soot had flown down and marched forward to see what was being done
nut and $shell$ chattered about it from a cherry tree it planted said $mester_colin$ at last and the sun is only slipping over the edge
and $dickon$ helped him and the $magic$ or whatever it was so gave him strength that when the sun did slip over the edge and end the strange lovely afternoon for them there he actually stood on his two feet laughing
help me up $dickon$ i want to be standing when it goes that part of the $magic$ #chapter# xxiii $magic$ dr $mr_archibald_craven$ had been waiting some time at the house when they returned to it
he had indeed begun to wonder if it might not be wise to send some #one# out to explore the #garden# paths
when $mester_colin$ was brought back to his room the poor man looked him over seriously you should not have stayed so long he said
you must not overexert yourself i am not tired at all said $mester_colin$ it has made me well tomorrow i am going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon
i am not sure that i can allow it answered dr $mr_archibald_craven$ i am afraid it would not be wise
even $mary_lennox$ had found out that #one# of $mester_colin$ chief peculiarities was that he did not know in the least what a rude little brute he was with his way of ordering people about
he had lived on a sort of desert island all his life and as he had been the king of it he had made his own manners and had had no #one# to compare himself with
$mary_lennox$ had indeed been rather like him herself and since she had been at misselthwaite had gradually discovered that her own manners had not been of the kind which is usual or popular
it would not be wise to try to stop me said $mester_colin$ quite seriously i am going having made this discovery she naturally thought it of enough interest to communicate to $mester_colin$
so she sat and looked at him curiously for a few minutes after dr $mr_archibald_craven$ had gone she wanted to make him ask her why she was doing it
and of #course# she did what are you looking at me for he said i thinking that i am rather sorry for dr $mr_archibald_craven$
so am i said $mester_colin$ calmly but not without an air of some satisfaction he wont get misselthwaite at all now i not going to die
i sorry for him because of that of #course# said $mary_lennox$ but i was thinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have had to be polite for ten years to a boy who was always rude
if you had been his own boy and he had been a slapping sort of man said $mary_lennox$ he would have slapped you
i would never have done it am i rude $mester_colin$ inquired undisturbedly but he darent said $mester_colin$
no he darent answered mistress $mary_lennox$ thinking the #thing# out quite without prejudice nobody ever dared to do anything you didnt like because you were going to die and #thing# like that
you were such a poor #thing# but announced $mester_colin$ stubbornly i am not going to be a poor #thing# i wont let people think i #one#
i stood on my feet this afternoon it is always having your own way that has made you so queer $mary_lennox$ went on thinking aloud
$mester_colin$ turned his head frowning am i queer he demanded yes answered $mary_lennox$ very but you neednt be cross she added impartially because so am
i queer and so is $ben_weatherstaff$ but i am not as queer as i was before i began to like people and
before i found the #garden# i dont want to be queer said $mester_colin$ i am not going to be and he frowned again with determination
he was a very proud boy he lay thinking for a while and then $mary_lennox$ saw his beautiful smile begin and gradually change his whole face
i shall stop being queer he said if i go every #day# to the #garden# there is $magic$ in there good $magic$ you know $mary_lennox$
i am sure there is so am i said $mary_lennox$ even if it isnt real $magic$ $mester_colin$ said we can pretend it is
they always called it $magic$ and indeed it seemed like it in the months that followed the wonderful months the radiant months the amazing #one#
something is there something it $magic$ said $mary_lennox$ but not black it as white as snow oh the #thing# which happened in that #garden#
if you have never had a #garden# you cannot understand and if you have had a #garden# you will know that it would take a whole book to describe all that came to pass there
at first it seemed that green #thing# would never cease pushing their way through the earth in the grass in the beds even in the crevices of the walls
then the green #thing# began to show buds and the buds began to unfurl and show #color# every shade of blue every shade of purple every tint and hue of crimson
$ben_weatherstaff$ had seen it done and had himself scraped out mortar from between the bricks of the wall and made pockets of earth for lovely clinging #thing# to grow on
iris and white lilies rose out of the grass in sheaves and the green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armies of the blue and white flower lances of tall delphiniums or columbines or campanulas
in its happy #day# flowers had been tucked away into every inch and hole and corner she was main fond them she was $ben_weatherstaff$ said
she liked them #thing# as was allus pointin up to th blue sky she used to tell not as she was #one# them as looked down on th earth not her
she just loved it but she said as th blue sky allus looked so joyful the seeds $dickon$ and $mary_lennox$ had planted grew as if fairies had tended them
satiny poppies of all tints danced in the breeze by the score gaily defying flowers which had lived in the #garden# for years and which it might be confessed seemed rather to wonder how such new people had got there
rising out of the grass tangled round the sun dial wreathing the tree trunks and hanging from their branches climbing up the walls and spreading over them with long garlands falling in cascades they came alive #day# by #day# hour by hour
fair fresh leaves and buds and buds tiny at first but swelling and working $magic$ until they burst and uncurled into cups of scent delicately spilling themselves over their brims and filling the #garden# air
every morning he was brought out and every hour of each #day# when it didnt rain he spent in the #garden#
and the roses the roses $mester_colin$ saw it all watching each change as it took place even gray #day# pleased him he would lie on the grass watching #thing# growing he said
also you could make the acquaintance of strange busy insect #thing# running about on various unknown but evidently serious errands sometimes carrying tiny scraps of straw or feather or food or climbing blades of grass as if they were trees from whose tops #one# could look out to explore the country
a mole throwing up its mound at the end of its burrow and making its way out at last with the long nailed paws which looked so like elfish hands had absorbed him #one# whole morning
ants ways beetles ways bees ways frogs ways birds ways plants ways gave him a new #world# to explore and when $dickon$ revealed them all and added foxes ways otters ways ferrets ways squirrels ways and trout and water rats and badgers ways there was no end to the #thing# to talk about and think over
if you watched long enough he declared you could see buds unsheath themselves and this was not the half of the $magic$
the fact that he had really once stood on his feet had set $mester_colin$ thinking tremendously and when $mary_lennox$ told him of the spell she had worked he was excited and approved of it greatly
of #course# there must be lots of $magic$ in the #world# he said wisely #one# #day# but people dont know what it is like or how to make it
he talked of it constantly perhaps the beginning is just to say nice #thing# are going to happen until you make them happen
i am going to try and experiment the next morning when they went to the secret #garden# he sent at once for $ben_weatherstaff$
$ben_weatherstaff$ came as quickly as he could and found the $rajah$ standing on his feet under a tree and looking very grand but also very beautifully smiling
i want you and $dickon$ and miss $mary_lennox$ to stand in a row and listen to me because i am going to tell you something very important
#one# of the long concealed charms of $ben_weatherstaff$ was that in his boyhood he had once run away to sea and had made voyages
good morning $ben_weatherstaff$ he said aye aye sir answered $ben_weatherstaff$ touching his forehead so he could reply like a sailor
when i grow up i am going to make great scientific discoveries and i am going to begin now with this experiment
i am going to try a scientific experiment explained the $rajah$ aye aye sir said $ben_weatherstaff$ promptly though this was the first time he had heard of great scientific discoveries
it was the first time $mary_lennox$ had heard of them either but even at this stage she had begun to realize that
queer as he was $mester_colin$ had read about a great many singular #thing# and was somehow a very convincing sort of boy
when he held up his head and fixed his strange #eye# on you it seemed as if you believed him almost in spite of yourself though he was only ten years old going on eleven
at this moment he was especially convincing because he suddenly felt the fascination of actually making a sort of speech like a grown up person
$magic$ is a great #thing# and scarcely any #one# knows anything about it except a few people in old books and $mary_lennox$ a little because she was born in india where there are fakirs
the great scientific discoveries i am going to make he went on will be about $magic$ i believe $dickon$ knows some $magic$ but perhaps he doesnt know he knows it
i would never have let him come to see me if he had not been an animal charmer which is a boy charmer too because a boy is an animal
i am sure there is $magic$ in everything only we have not sense enough to get hold of it and make it do #thing# for us like electricity and horses and steam
he charms animals and people this sounded so imposing that $ben_weatherstaff$ became quite excited and really could not keep still
aye aye sir he said and he began to stand up quite straight when $mary_lennox$ found this #garden# it looked quite dead the orator proceeded
then something began pushing #thing# up out of the soil and making #thing# out of nothing #one# #day# #thing# werent there and another they were
i had never watched #thing# before and it made me feel very curious scientific people are always curious and i am going to be scientific
i keep saying to myself what is it what is it it something it cant be nothing i dont know its name
i have never seen the sun rise but $mary_lennox$ and $dickon$ have and from what they tell me i am sure that is $magic$ too
sometimes since i ve been in the #garden# i ve looked up through the trees at the sky and i have had a strange feeling of being happy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making me breathe fast
so i call it $magic$ something pushes it up and draws it $magic$ is always pushing and drawing and making #thing# out of nothing
everything is made out of $magic$ leaves and trees flowers and birds badgers and foxes and squirrels and people so it must be all around us
the $magic$ in this #garden# has made me stand up and know i am going to live to be a man
i am going to make the scientific experiment of trying to get some and put it in myself and make it push and draw me and make me strong
in this #garden# in all the places i dont know how to do it but i think that if you keep thinking about it and calling it perhaps it will come
when i was going to try to stand that first time $mary_lennox$ kept saying to herself as fast as she could you can do it
perhaps that is the first #baby# way to get it you can do it and i did i had to try myself at the same time of #course# but her $magic$ helped me and so did $dickon$
every morning and evening and as often in the daytime as i can remember i am going to say $magic$ is in me
$magic$ is making me well i am going to be as strong as $dickon$ as strong as $dickon$ and you must all do it too
if you keep doing it every #day# as regularly as soldiers go through drill we shall see what will happen and find out if the experiment succeeds
that is my experiment will you help $ben_weatherstaff$ aye aye sir said $ben_weatherstaff$ aye aye you learn #thing# by saying them over and over and thinking about them until they stay in your mind forever
and i think it will be the same with $magic$ if you keep calling it to come to you and help you it will get to be part of you
i once heard an officer in india tell my mother that there were fakirs who said words over and over thousands of times said $mary_lennox$
i ve heard jem fettleworth wife say th same #thing# over thousands times callin jem a drunken brute said $ben_weatherstaff$ dryly
and it will stay and do #thing# summat allus come that sure enough he gave her a good hidin an went to th blue lion an got as drunk as a lord
$mester_colin$ drew his brows together and thought a few minutes then he cheered up well he said you see something did come of it
if she used the right $magic$ and had said something nice perhaps he wouldnt have got as drunk as a lord and perhaps perhaps he might have bought her a new bonnet
she used the wrong $magic$ until she made him beat her $ben_weatherstaff$ chuckled and there was shrewd admiration in his little old #eye#
next time i see bess fettleworth i ll give her a bit of a hint what $magic$ will do for her
#tha# rt a clever lad as well as a straight legged #one# $mester_colin$ he said she be rare an pleased if th sinetifik speriment worked an so ud jem
nut and $shell$ were on his shoulders and he held a long eared white rabbit in his arm and stroked and stroked it softly while it laid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself
$dickon$ had stood listening to the lecture his round #eye# shining with curious delight do you think the experiment will work
he so often wondered what $dickon$ was thinking when he saw him looking at him or at #one# of his creatures with his happy wide smile
$mester_colin$ asked him wondering what he was thinking he smiled now and his smile was wider than usual aye he answered that i do
it ll work same as th seeds do when th sun shines on em it ll work for sure shall us begin it now
$mester_colin$ was delighted and so was $mary_lennox$ fired by recollections of fakirs and devotees in illustrations $mester_colin$ suggested that they should all sit cross legged under the tree which made a canopy
it will be like sitting in a sort of temple said $mester_colin$ i rather tired and i want to sit down
eh said $dickon$ #tha# mustnt begin by sayin #tha# rt tired #tha# might spoil th $magic$ $mester_colin$ turned and looked at him into his innocent round #eye#
that true he said slowly i must only think of the $magic$ it all seemed most majestic and mysterious when they sat down in their circle
ordinarily he was very fixed in being what he called agen prayer meetin but this being the $rajah$ affair he did not resent it and was indeed inclined to be gratified at being called upon to assist
$dickon$ held his rabbit in his arm and perhaps he made some charmer signal no #one# heard for when he sat down cross legged like the rest the crow the fox the squirrels and the lamb slowly drew near and made part of the circle settling each into a place of rest as if of their own desire
$ben_weatherstaff$ felt as if he had somehow been led into appearing at a prayer meeting mistress $mary_lennox$ felt solemnly enraptured
the creatures have come said $mester_colin$ gravely they want to help us $mester_colin$ really looked quite beautiful $mary_lennox$ thought
he held his head high as if he felt like a sort of priest and his strange #eye# had a wonderful look in them
the light shone on him through the tree canopy now we will begin he said shall we sway backward and forward $mary_lennox$ as if we were dervishes
the $magic$ will take them away said $mester_colin$ in a high priest tone but we wont sway until it has done it
i canna do no swayin back ard and for ard said $ben_weatherstaff$ i ve got th rheumatics we will only chant
i canna do no chantin said $ben_weatherstaff$ a trifle testily they turned me out th church choir th only time i ever tried it
no #one# smiled they were all too much in earnest $mester_colin$ face was not even crossed by a shadow he was thinking only of the $magic$
then i will chant he said and he began looking like a strange boy spirit the sun is shining the sun is shining
that is the $magic$ the flowers are growing the roots are stirring that is the $magic$ being alive is the $magic$ being strong is the $magic$
the $magic$ is in me the $magic$ is in me it is in me it is in me it in every #one# of us
it in $ben_weatherstaff$ back $magic$ magic come and help he said it a great many times not a thousand times but quite a goodly number
$mary_lennox$ listened entranced she felt as if it were at once queer and beautiful and she wanted him to go on and on
$ben_weatherstaff$ began to feel soothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable the humming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice and drowsily melted into a doze
soot had pushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him on his shoulder the gray film dropped over his #eye#
$dickon$ sat cross legged with his rabbit asleep on his arm and a hand resting on the lamb back at last $mester_colin$ stopped
now i am going to walk round the #garden# he announced $ben_weatherstaff$ head had just dropped forward and he lifted it with a jerk
you have been asleep said $mester_colin$ nowt th sort mumbled $ben_weatherstaff$ th sermon was good enow but i bound to get out afore th collection
he was not quite awake yet you re not in church said $mester_colin$ not me said $ben_weatherstaff$ straightening himself
who said i were i heard every bit of it you said th $magic$ was in my back th doctor calls it rheumatics
the $rajah$ waved his hand that was the wrong $magic$ he said you will get better you have my permission to go to your work
but come back tomorrow i like to see thee walk round the #garden# grunted $ben_weatherstaff$ it was not an unfriendly grunt but it was a grunt
in fact being a stubborn old party and not having entire faith in $magic$ he had made up his mind that if he were sent away he would climb his ladder and look over the wall so that he might be ready to hobble back if there were any stumbling
the $rajah$ did not object to his staying and so the procession was formed it really did look like a procession
$ben_weatherstaff$ walked behind and the creatures trailed after them the lamb and the fox cub keeping close to $dickon$ the white rabbit hopping along or stopping to nibble and soot following with the solemnity of a person who felt himself in charge
$mester_colin$ was at its head with $dickon$ on #one# side and $mary_lennox$ on the other it was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity
$mester_colin$ leaned on $dickon$ arm and privately $ben_weatherstaff$ kept a sharp lookout but now and then $mester_colin$ took his hand from its support and walked a few steps alone
every few yards it stopped to rest his head was held up all the time and he looked very grand
the $magic$ is in me he kept saying the $magic$ is making me strong i can feel it i can feel it
he sat on the seats in the alcoves and once or twice he sat down on the grass and several times he paused in the path and leaned on $dickon$ but he would not give up until he had gone all round the #garden#
it seemed very certain that something was upholding and uplifting him when he returned to the canopy tree his cheeks were flushed and he looked triumphant
i did it the $magic$ worked he cried that is my first scientific discovery what will dr $mr_archibald_craven$ say broke out $mary_lennox$
he wont say anything $mester_colin$ answered because he will not be told this is to be the biggest secret of all
no #one# is to know anything about it until i have grown so strong that i can walk and run like any other boy
i wont have people whispering and asking questions and i wont let my father hear about it until the experiment has quite succeeded
i shall come here every #day# in my chair and i shall be taken back in it then sometime when he comes back to misselthwaite
i shall just walk into his study and say here i am i am like any other boy i am quite well
and i shall live to be a man it has been done by a scientific experiment he will think he is in a dream cried $mary_lennox$
he had made himself believe that he was going to get well which was really more than half the battle if he had been aware of it
and the thought which stimulated him more than any other was this imagining what his father would look like when he saw that he had a son who was as straight and strong as other fathers sons
#one# of his darkest miseries in the unhealthy morbid past #day# had been his hatred of being a sickly weak backed boy whose father was afraid to look at him
#one# of the #thing# i am going to do after the $magic$ works and before i begin to make scientific discoveries is to be an athlete
he wont believe his #eye# $mester_colin$ flushed triumphantly he ll be obliged to believe them he said we shall have thee takin to boxin in a week or so said $ben_weatherstaff$
#tha# lt end wi winnin th belt an bein champion prize fighter of all england $mester_colin$ fixed his #eye# on him sternly
$ben_weatherstaff$ he said that is disrespectful you must not take liberties because you are in the secret however much the $magic$ works i shall not be a prize fighter
i shall be a scientific discoverer ax pardon ax pardon sir answered $ben_weatherstaff$ touching his forehead in salute i ought to have seed
it wasnt a jokin matter but his #eye# twinkled and secretly he was immensely pleased he really did not mind being snubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was gaining strength and spirit
#chapter# xxiv let them laugh the secret #garden# was not the only #one# $dickon$ worked in round the cottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wall of rough stones
early in the morning and late in the fading twilight and on all the #day# $mester_colin$ and $mary_lennox$ did not see him $dickon$ worked there planting or tending potatoes and cabbages turnips and carrots and herbs for his mother
while he dug or weeded he whistled or sang bits of $yorkshire$ moor songs or talked to soot or captain or the brothers and #sister# he had taught to help him
in the company of his creatures he did wonders there and was never tired of doing them it seemed we never get on as comfortable as we do mrs $susan_sowerby$ said if it wasnt for $dickon$ #garden#
his taters and cabbages is twice th size of any #one# else an they ve got a flavor with em as nobody has
anything ll grow for him when she found a moment to spare she liked to go out and talk to him
after supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that was her quiet time she could sit upon the low rough wall and look on and hear stories of the #day#
$dickon$ had bought penny packages of flower seeds now and then and sown bright sweet scented #thing# among gooseberry bushes and even cabbages
and he grew borders of mignonette and pinks and pansies and #thing# whose seeds he could save year after year or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time into fine clumps
the low wall was #one# of the prettiest #thing# in $yorkshire$ because he had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock cress and hedgerow flowers into every crevice until only here and there glimpses of the stones were to be seen
all a chap got to do to make em thrive mother he would say is to be friends with em for sure
she loved this time there were not only vegetables in this #garden# they re just like th creatures if they re thirsty give em drink and if they re hungry give em a bit food
they want to live same as we do if they died i should feel as if i been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless
at first she was only told that $mester_colin$ had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds with miss $mary_lennox$ and that it was doing him good
but it was not long before it was agreed between the two children that $dickon$ mother might come into the secret
it was in these twilight hours that mrs $susan_sowerby$ heard of all that happened at misselthwaite manor somehow it was not doubted that she was safe for sure
$dickon$ told the whole story with all the thrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray haze which had seemed like deadness and the secret mistress $mary_lennox$ had planned never to reveal
the coming of $dickon$ and how it had been told to him the doubt of $mester_colin$ and the final drama of his introduction to the hidden domain combined with the incident of $ben_weatherstaff$ angry face peering over the wall and $mester_colin$ sudden indignant strength made mrs $susan_sowerby$ nice looking face quite change #color# several times
so #one# beautiful still evening my word she said it was a good #thing# that little lass came to th manor
it been th makin her an th savin him standin on his feet an us all thinkin he was a poor half witted lad with not a straight bone in him
she asked a great many questions and her blue #eye# were full of deep thinking what do they make of it at th manor
him being so well an cheerful an never complainin she inquired they dont know what to make of it answered $dickon$
every #day# as comes round his face looks different it fillin out and doesnt look so sharp an th waxy #color# is goin
but he has to do his bit complainin with a highly entertained grin what for i mercy name asked mrs $susan_sowerby$
$dickon$ chuckled he does it to keep them from guessin what happened if the doctor knew he found out he could stand on his feet he likely write and tell $mester_colin$ $mr_archibald_craven$
$mester_colin$ savin th secret to tell himself he goin to practise his $magic$ on his legs every #day# till his father comes back
but him an miss $mary_lennox$ thinks it best plan to do a bit groanin an frettin now an then to throw folk off th scent
an then he goin to march into his room an show him he as straight as other lads mrs $susan_sowerby$ was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before he had finished his last sentence
eh she said that pair enjoyin their selves i ll warrant they ll get a good bit actin out of it an there s
nothin children likes as much as play actin let hear what they do $dickon$ lad $dickon$ stopped weeding and sat up on his heels to tell her
his #eye# were twinkling with fun $mester_colin$ is carried down to his chair every time he goes out he explained
he makes himself as helpless lookin as he can an never lifts his head until we re out sight th house
an he flies out at john th footman for not carryin him careful enough an he grunts an frets a good bit when he bein settled into his chair
him an miss $mary_lennox$ both got to enjoyin it an when he groans an complains she ll say poor $mester_colin$ does it hurt you so much
are you so weak as that poor $mester_colin$ but th trouble is that sometimes they can scarce keep from burstin out laughin
an they have to stuff their faces into $mester_colin$ cushions to keep the gardeners from hearin if any of em about
when we get safe into the #garden# they laugh till they ve no breath left to laugh with th more they laugh th better for em said mrs $susan_sowerby$ still laughing herself
good healthy child laughin better than pills any #day# th year that pair ll plump up for sure they are plumpin up said $dickon$
they re that hungry they dont know how to get enough to eat without makin talk $mester_colin$ says if he keeps sendin for more food they wont believe he an invalid at all
miss $mary_lennox$ says she ll let him eat her share but he says that if she goes hungry she ll get thin an they mun both get fat at once
mrs $susan_sowerby$ laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty that she quite rocked backward and forward in her blue cloak and $dickon$ laughed with her
i ll tell thee what lad mrs $susan_sowerby$ said when she could speak i ve thought of a way to help em
when #tha# goes to em in th mornin #tha# shall take a pail good new milk an i ll bake em a crusty cottage loaf or some buns
then they could take off th edge their hunger while they were in their #garden# an th fine food they get indoors ud polish off th corners
wi currants in em same as you children like nothin so good as fresh milk an bread eh mother said $dickon$ admiringly what a wonder #tha# art
#tha# always sees a way out #thing# they was quite in a pother yesterday they didnt see how they was to manage without orderin up more food they felt that empty inside
they re two young uns growin fast an health comin back to both of em children like that feels like young wolves an food flesh an blood to em said mrs $susan_sowerby$
she was quite right the comfortable wonderful mother creature and she had never been more so than when she said their play actin
then she smiled $dickon$ own curving smile eh but they re enjoyin theirselves for sure she said would be their joy
the idea of protecting themselves from suspicion had been unconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled nurse and then by dr $mr_archibald_craven$ himself
$mester_colin$ and $mary_lennox$ found it #one# of their most thrilling sources of entertainment your appetite is improving very much master $mester_colin$ the nurse had said #one# #day#
nothing disagrees with me now replied $mester_colin$ and then seeing the nurse looking at him curiously he suddenly remembered that perhaps he ought not to appear too well just yet
you used to eat nothing and so many #thing# disagreed with you at least #thing# dont so often disagree with me
it the fresh air perhaps it is said the nurse still looking at him with a mystified #expression# but i must talk to dr $mr_archibald_craven$ about it
how she stared at you said $mary_lennox$ when she went away as if she thought there must be something to find out
i wont have her finding out #thing# said $mester_colin$ no #one# must begin to find out yet when dr $mr_archibald_craven$ came that morning he seemed puzzled also
he asked a number of questions to $mester_colin$ great annoyance you stay out in the #garden# a great deal he suggested
where do you go $mester_colin$ put on his favorite air of dignified indifference to opinion i will not let any #one# know where i go he answered
i go to a place i like every #one# has orders to keep out of the way i wont be watched and stared at
you know that you seem to be out all #day# but i do not think it has done you harm i do not think so
the nurse says that you eat much more than you have ever done before perhaps said $mester_colin$ prompted by a sudden inspiration perhaps it is an unnatural appetite
i do not think so as your food seems to agree with you said dr $mr_archibald_craven$ you are gaining flesh rapidly and your #color# is better
perhaps perhaps i am bloated and feverish said $mester_colin$ assuming a discouraging air of gloom people who are not going to live are often different
dr $mr_archibald_craven$ shook his head he was holding $mester_colin$ wrist and he pushed up his sleeve and felt his arm
you are not feverish he said thoughtfully and such flesh as you have gained is healthy if you can keep this up my boy we need not talk of dying
your father will be happy to hear of this remarkable improvement i wont have him told $mester_colin$ broke forth fiercely
it will only disappoint him if i get worse again and i may get worse this very night i might have a raging fever
i feel as if i might be beginning to have #one# now i wont have letters written to my father i wont
i wont you are making me angry and you know that is bad for me i feel hot already i hate being written about and being talked over as much as i hate being stared at
hush my boy dr $mr_archibald_craven$ soothed him nothing shall be written without your permission you are too sensitive about #thing#
he said no more about writing to $mr_archibald_craven$ and when he saw the nurse he privately warned her that such a possibility must not be mentioned to the patient
you must not undo the good which has been done the boy is extraordinarily better he said his advance seems almost abnormal
but of #course# he is doing now of his own free will what we could not make him do before still he excites himself very easily and nothing must be said to irritate him
$mary_lennox$ and $mester_colin$ were much alarmed and talked together anxiously from this time dated their plan of play actin
i may be obliged to have a tantrum said $mester_colin$ regretfully i dont want to have #one# and i not miserable enough now to work myself into a big #one#
perhaps i couldnt have #one# at all that lump doesnt come in my throat now and i keep thinking of nice #thing# instead of horrible #one#
he made up his mind to eat less but unfortunately it was not possible to carry out this brilliant idea when he wakened each morning with an amazing appetite and the table near his sofa was set with a breakfast of home made bread and fresh butter snow white eggs raspberry jam and clotted cream
$mary_lennox$ always breakfasted with him and when they found themselves at the table particularly if there were delicate slices of sizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silver cover they would look into each other #eye# in desperation
but if they talk about writing to my father i shall have to do something i think we shall have to eat it all this morning $mary_lennox$ $mester_colin$ always ended by saying
but they never found they could send away anything and the highly polished condition of the empty plates returned to the pantry awakened much comment
i do wish $mester_colin$ would say also i do wish the slices of ham were thicker and #one# muffin each is not enough for any #one#
it enough for a person who is going to die answered $mary_lennox$ when first she heard this but it not enough for a person who is going to live
i sometimes feel as if i could eat three when those nice fresh heather and gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open window
the morning that $dickon$ after they had been enjoying themselves in the #garden# for about two hours went behind a big rosebush and brought forth two tin pails and revealed that #one# was full of rich new milk with cream on the top of it and that the other held cottage made currant buns folded in a clean blue and white napkin buns so carefully tucked in that they were still hot there was a riot of surprised joyfulness
we can send away some of the lunch and a great deal of the dinner what a wonderful #thing# for mrs $susan_sowerby$ to think of
what a kind clever woman she must be how good the buns were and what delicious fresh milk $magic$ is in her just as it is in $dickon$ said $mester_colin$
it makes her think of ways to do #thing# nice #thing# she is a $magic$ person tell her we are grateful $dickon$ extremely grateful
he was given to using rather grown up phrases at times he enjoyed them he liked this so much that he improved upon it
and then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed himself with buns and drank milk out of the pail in copious draughts in the manner of any hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise and breathing in moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours behind him
tell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme this was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind
that as mrs $susan_sowerby$ had fourteen people to provide food for she might not have enough to satisfy two extra appetites every #day#
they actually awoke to the fact so they asked her to let them send some of their shillings to buy #thing#
$dickon$ made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the park outside the #garden# where $mary_lennox$ had first found him piping to the wild creatures there was a deep little hollow where you could build a sort of tiny oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it
roasted eggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt and fresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king besides being deliciously satisfying
you could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat as many as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of the mouths of fourteen people
every beautiful morning the $magic$ was worked by the mystic circle under the plum tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after its brief blossom time was ended
after the ceremony $mester_colin$ always took his walking exercise and throughout the #day# he exercised his newly found power at intervals
each #day# he grew stronger and could walk more steadily and cover more ground and each #day# his belief in the $magic$ grew stronger as well it might
he tried #one# experiment after another as he felt himself gaining strength and it was $dickon$ who showed him the best #thing# of all
yesterday he said #one# morning after an absence i went to thwaite for mother an near th blue cow inn
i seed bob haworth he the strongest chap on th moor he the champion wrestler an he can jump higher than any other chap an throw th hammer farther
he knowed me ever since i was a little un an he a friendly sort an i axed him some questions
th gentry calls him a athlete and i thought thee $mester_colin$ and i says how did #tha# make #tha# muscles stick out that way bob
he gone all th way to scotland for th sports some years did #tha# do anythin extra to make thysel so strong
a strong man in a show that came to thwaite once showed me how to exercise my arms an legs an every muscle in my body
an i says could a delicate chap make himself stronger with em bob an he laughed an says art #tha# th delicate chap
an i says no but i knows a young gentleman that gettin well of a long illness an i wish i knowed some them tricks to tell him about
he friendly same as i said an he stood up an showed me good natured like an i imitated what he did till i knowed it by heart
an he says well yes lad i did i didnt say no names an he didnt ask none $mester_colin$ had been listening excitedly
can you show me he cried will you aye to be sure $dickon$ answered getting up but he says #tha# mun do em gentle at first
an be careful not to tire thysel rest in between times an take deep breaths an dont overdo i ll be careful said $mester_colin$
show me show me $dickon$ you are the most $magic$ boy in the #world# $dickon$ stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefully practical but simple series of muscle exercises
$mester_colin$ watched them with widening #eye# he could do a few while he was sitting down presently he did a few gently while he stood upon his already steadied feet
soot who was watching the performance became much disturbed and left his branch and hopped about restlessly because he could not do them too
$mary_lennox$ began to do them also from that time the exercises were part of the #day# duties as much as the $magic$ was
it became possible for both $mester_colin$ and $mary_lennox$ to do more of them each time they tried and such appetites were the results that but for the basket $dickon$ put down behind the bush each morning when he arrived they would have been lost
but the little oven in the hollow and mrs $susan_sowerby$ bounties were so satisfying that $mrs_medlock$ and the nurse and dr $mr_archibald_craven$ became mystified again
you can trifle with your breakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the brim with roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new milk and oatcakes and buns and heather honey and clotted cream
they are eating next to nothing said the nurse they ll die of starvation if they cant be persuaded to take some nourishment
and yet see how they look look exclaimed $mrs_medlock$ indignantly eh i moithered to death with them
bursting their jackets #one# #day# and the next turning up their noses at the best meals cook can tempt them with
they re a pair of young satans not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and bread sauce did they set a fork into yesterday and the poor woman fair invented a pudding for them and back it sent
dr $mr_archibald_craven$ came and looked at $mester_colin$ long and carefully he wore an extremely worried #expression# when the nurse talked with him and showed him the almost untouched tray of breakfast she had saved for him to look at but it was even more worried when he sat down by $mester_colin$ sofa and examined him
she almost cried she afraid she ll be blamed if they starve themselves into their graves he had been called to london on business and had not seen the boy for nearly two weeks
the waxen tinge had left colins skin and a warm rose showed through it his beautiful #eye# were clear and the hollows under them and in his cheeks and temples had filled out
his once dark heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily from his forehead and were soft and warm with life
when young #thing# begin to gain health they gain it rapidly his lips were fuller and of a normal #color# in fact as an imitation of a boy who was a confirmed invalid he was a disgraceful sight
dr $mr_archibald_craven$ held his chin in his hand and thought him over i am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything he said
that will not do you will lose all you have gained and you have gained amazingly you ate so well a short time ago
$mary_lennox$ was sitting on her stool nearby and she suddenly made a very queer #sound# which she tried so violently to repress that she ended by almost choking
i told you it was an unnatural appetite answered $mester_colin$ what is the matter said dr $mr_archibald_craven$ turning to look at her
$mary_lennox$ became quite severe in her manner it was something between a sneeze and a cough she replied with reproachful dignity and it got into my throat
it just burst out because all at once i couldnt help remembering that last big potato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit through that thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it
but she said afterward to $mester_colin$ i couldnt stop myself is there any way in which those children can get food secretly
dr $mr_archibald_craven$ inquired of $mrs_medlock$ there no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off the trees $mrs_medlock$ answered
they stay out in the grounds all #day# and see no #one# but each other and if they want anything different to eat from what sent up to them they need only ask for it
well said dr $mr_archibald_craven$ so long as going without food agrees with them we need not disturb ourselves the boy is a new creature
so is the girl said $mrs_medlock$ she begun to be downright pretty since she filled out and lost her ugly little sour look
the glummest ill natured little #thing# she used to be and now her and master $mester_colin$ laugh together like a pair of crazy young #one#
her hair grown thick and healthy looking and she got a bright #color# perhaps they re growing fat on that perhaps they are said dr $mr_archibald_craven$
let them laugh #chapter# xxv the curtain and the secret #garden# bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed new miracles
in the robin nest there were eggs and the robin mate sat upon them keeping them warm with her feathery little breast and careful wings
even $dickon$ did not go near the close grown corner in those #day# but waited until by the quiet working of some mysterious spell he seemed to have conveyed to the soul of the little pair that in the #garden# there was nothing which was not quite like themselves nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of what was happening to them the immense tender terrible heart breaking beauty and solemnity of eggs
at first she was very nervous and the robin himself was indignantly watchful if there had been #one# person in that #garden# who had not known through all his
or her innermost being that if an egg were taken away or hurt the whole #world# would whirl round and crash through space and come to an end if there had been even #one# who did not feel it and act accordingly there could have been no happiness even in that golden springtime air
but they all knew it and felt it and the robin and his mate knew they knew it at first the robin watched $mary_lennox$ and $mester_colin$ with sharp anxiety
the first moment he set his dew bright black #eye# on $dickon$ he knew he was not a stranger but a sort of robin without beak or feathers
for some mysterious reason he knew he need not watch $dickon$ he could speak robin which is a quite distinct language not to be mistaken for any other
$dickon$ always spoke it to the robin himself so the queer gibberish he used when he spoke to humans did not matter in the least
to speak robin to a robin is like speaking french to a frenchman the robin thought he spoke this gibberish to them because they were not intelligent enough to understand feathered speech
his movements also were robin they never startled #one# by being sudden enough to seem dangerous or threatening any robin could understand $dickon$ so his presence was not even disturbing
but at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard against the other two in the first place the boy creature did not come into the #garden# on his legs
he was pushed in on a #thing# with wheels and the skins of wild animals were thrown over him that in itself was doubtful
then when he began to stand up and move about he did it in a queer unaccustomed way and the others seemed to have to help him
the robin used to secrete himself in a bush and watch this anxiously his head tilted first on #one# side and then on the other
he thought that the slow movements might mean that he was preparing to pounce as cats do when cats are preparing to pounce they creep over the ground very slowly
the robin talked this over with his mate a great deal for a few #day# but after that he decided not to speak of the subject because her terror was so great that he was afraid it might be injurious to the eggs
when the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly it was an immense relief but for a long time or it seemed a long time to the robin he was a source of some anxiety
but he had a way of sitting or lying down for a while and then getting up in a disconcerting manner to begin again
#one# #day# the robin remembered that when he himself had been made to learn to fly by his parents he had done much the same sort of #thing#
he did not act as the other humans did he seemed very fond of walking he had taken short flights of a few yards and then had been obliged to rest
he mentioned this to his mate and when he told her that the eggs would probably conduct themselves in the same way after they were fledged she was quite comforted and even became eagerly interested and derived great pleasure from watching the boy over the edge of her nest though she always thought that the eggs would be much cleverer and learn more quickly
but then she said indulgently that humans were always more clumsy and slow than eggs and most of them never seemed really to learn to fly at all
so it occurred to him that this boy was learning to fly or rather to walk you never met them in the air or on tree tops
after a while the boy began to move about as the others did but all three of the children at times did unusual #thing#
they would stand under the trees and move their arms and legs and heads about in a way which was neither walking nor running nor sitting down
they went through these movements at intervals every #day# and the robin was never able to explain to his mate what they were doing or tying to do
he could only say that he was sure that the eggs would never flap about in such a manner but as the boy who could speak robin so fluently was doing the #thing# with them birds could be quite sure that the actions were not of a dangerous nature
of #course# neither the robin nor his mate had ever heard of the champion wrestler bob haworth and his exercises for making the muscles stand out like lumps
robins are not like human beings their muscles are always exercised from the first and so they develop themselves in a natural manner
if you have to fly about to find every meal you eat your muscles do not become atrophied atrophied means wasted away through want of use
when the boy was walking and running about and digging and weeding like the others the nest in the corner was brooded over by a great peace and content
knowing that your eggs were as safe as if they were locked in a bank vault and the fact that you could watch so many curious #thing# going on made setting a most entertaining occupation
on wet #day# the eggs mother sometimes felt even a little dull because the children did not come into the #garden#
fears for the eggs became #thing# of the past but even on wet #day# it could not be said that $mary_lennox$ and $mester_colin$ were dull
#one# morning when the rain streamed down unceasingly and $mester_colin$ was beginning to feel a little restive as he was obliged to remain on his sofa because it was not safe to get up and walk about $mary_lennox$ had an inspiration
now that i am a real boy $mester_colin$ had said my legs and arms and all my body are so full of $magic$ that i cant keep them still
do you know that when i waken in the morning $mary_lennox$ when it quite early and the birds are just shouting outside and everything seems just shouting for joy even the trees and #thing# we cant really hear i feel as if i must jump out of bed and shout myself
they want to be doing #thing# all the time if i did it just think what would happen $mary_lennox$ giggled inordinately
the nurse would come running and $mrs_medlock$ would come running and they would be sure you had gone crazy
and they send for the doctor she said $mester_colin$ giggled himself he could see how they would all look how horrified by his outbreak and how amazed to see him standing upright
i wish my father would come home he said i want to tell him myself i always thinking about it but we couldnt go on like this much longer
i cant stand lying still and pretending and besides i look too different i wish it wasnt raining today it was then mistress $mary_lennox$ had her inspiration
$mester_colin$ she began mysteriously do you know how many rooms there are in this house about a thousand i suppose he answered
there about a hundred no #one# ever goes into said $mary_lennox$ and #one# rainy #day# i went and looked into ever so many of them
no #one# ever knew though $mrs_medlock$ nearly found me out i lost my way when i was coming back and i stopped at the end of your corridor
that was the second time i heard you #crying# $mester_colin$ started up on his sofa a hundred rooms no #one# goes into he said
it #sound# almost like a secret #garden# suppose we go and look at them wheel me in my chair and nobody would know we went
that what i was thinking said $mary_lennox$ no #one# would dare to follow us there are galleries where you could run
we could do our exercises there is a little indian room where there is a cabinet full of ivory elephants there are all sorts of rooms
ring the bell said $mester_colin$ when the nurse came in he gave his orders i want my chair he said
miss $mary_lennox$ and i are going to look at the part of the house which is not used john can push me as far as the picture gallery because there are some stairs
then he must go away and leave us alone until i send for him again rainy #day# lost their terrors that morning
when the footman had wheeled the chair into the picture gallery and left the two together in obedience to orders $mester_colin$ and $mary_lennox$ looked at each other delighted
as soon as $mary_lennox$ had made sure that john was really on his way back to his own quarters below stairs $mester_colin$ got out of his chair
i am going to run from #one# end of the gallery to the other he said and then i am going to jump
they looked at the portraits and found the plain little girl dressed in green brocade and holding the parrot on her finger
and then we will do bob haworth exercises and they did all these #thing# and many others all these said $mester_colin$ must be my relations
they lived a long time ago that parrot #one# i believe is #one# of my great great great great aunts she looks rather like you $mary_lennox$ not as you look now but as you looked when you came here
now you are a great deal fatter and better looking so are you said $mary_lennox$ and they both laughed they went to the indian room and amused themselves with the ivory elephants
they found the rose colored brocade boudoir and the hole in the cushion the mouse had left but the mice had grown up and run away and the hole was empty
they found new corridors and corners and flights of steps and new old pictures they liked and weird old #thing# they did not know the use of
it was a curiously entertaining morning and the feeling of wandering about in the same house with other people but at the same time feeling as if #one# were miles away from them was a fascinating #thing#
they saw more rooms and made more discoveries than $mary_lennox$ had made on her first pilgrimage i glad we came $mester_colin$ said
i never knew i lived in such a big queer old place i like it we will ramble about every rainy #day#
that morning they had found among other #thing# such good appetites that when they returned to $mester_colin$ room it was not possible to send the luncheon away untouched
when the nurse carried the tray down stairs she slapped it down on the kitchen dresser so that mrs loomis the cook could see the highly polished dishes and plates
we shall always be finding new queer corners and #thing# look at that she said this is a house of mystery and those two children are the greatest mysteries in it
if they keep that up every #day# said the strong young footman john there be small wonder that he weighs twice as much to #day# as he did a month ago
i should have to give up my place in time for fear of doing my muscles an injury that afternoon $mary_lennox$ noticed that something new had happened in $mester_colin$ room
she had noticed it the #day# before but had said nothing because she thought the change might have been made by chance
she said nothing today but she sat and looked fixedly at the picture over the mantel she could look at it because the curtain had been drawn aside
that was the change she noticed i know what you want me to tell you said $mester_colin$ after she had stared a few minutes
i always know when you want me to tell you something you are wondering why the curtain is drawn back
i am going to keep it like that why asked $mary_lennox$ because it doesnt make me angry any more to see her laughing
i wakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if the $magic$ was filling the room and making everything so splendid that i couldnt lie still
the room was quite light and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain and somehow that made me go and pull the cord
i got up and looked out of the window she looked right down at me as if she were laughing because she was glad i was standing there
it made me like to look at her i want to see her laughing like that all the time i think she must have been a sort of $magic$ person perhaps
you are so like her now said $mary_lennox$ that sometimes i think perhaps you are her ghost made into a boy
that idea seemed to impress $mester_colin$ he thought it over and then answered her slowly if i were her ghost my father would be fond of me
do you want him to be fond of you inquired $mary_lennox$ i used to hate it because he was not fond of me
if he grew fond of me i think i should tell him about the $magic$ it might make him more cheerful
#chapter# xxvi it mother their belief in the $magic$ was an abiding #thing# after the morning incantations $mester_colin$ sometimes gave them $magic$ lectures
i like to do it he explained because when i grow up and make great scientific discoveries i shall be obliged to lecture about them and so this is practise
i can only give short lectures now because i am very young and besides $ben_weatherstaff$ would feel as if he were in church and he would go to sleep
th best #thing# about lecturin said $ben_weatherstaff$ is that a chap can get up an say aught he pleases an no other chap can answer him back
i wouldnt be agen lecturin a bit mysel sometimes but when $mester_colin$ held forth under his tree old $ben_weatherstaff$ fixed devouring #eye# on him and kept them there
it was not so much the lecture which interested him as the legs which looked straighter and stronger each #day# the boyish head which held itself up so well the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks which had filled and rounded out and the #eye# which had begun to hold the light he remembered in another pair
he looked him over with critical affection sometimes when $mester_colin$ felt $ben_weatherstaff$ earnest gaze meant that he was much impressed he wondered what he was reflecting on
and once when he had seemed quite entranced he questioned him what are you thinking about $ben_weatherstaff$ he asked
i was thinkin answered $ben_weatherstaff$ as i warrant #tha# gone up three or four pound this week i was lookin at #tha# calves an #tha# shoulders
i like to get thee on a pair scales it the $magic$ and and mrs $susan_sowerby$ buns and milk and #thing# said $mester_colin$
you see the scientific experiment has succeeded that morning $dickon$ was too late to hear the lecture when he came he was ruddy with running and his funny face looked more twinkling than usual
as they had a good deal of weeding to do after the rains they fell to work they always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinking rain
the moisture which was good for the flowers was also good for the weeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of leaves which must be pulled up before their roots took too firm hold
$mester_colin$ was as good at weeding as any #one# in these #day# and he could lecture while he was doing it
the $magic$ works best when you work yourself he said this morning you can feel it in your bones and muscles
i am going to read books about bones and muscles but i am going to write a book about $magic$ i am making it up now
it was not very long after he had said this that he laid down his trowel and stood up on his feet
he had been silent for several minutes and they had seen that he was thinking out lectures as he often did
i keep finding out #thing# when he dropped his trowel and stood upright it seemed to $mary_lennox$ and $dickon$ as if a sudden strong thought had made him do it
he stretched himself out to his tallest height and he threw out his arms exultantly #color# glowed in his face and his strange #eye# widened with joyfulness
all at once he had realized something to the full $mary_lennox$ $dickon$ he cried just look at me
they stopped their weeding and looked at him do you remember that first morning you brought me in here
being an animal charmer he could see more #thing# than most people could and many of them were #thing# he never talked about
he demanded $dickon$ was looking at him very hard he saw some of them now in this boy aye that we do he answered
just this minute said $mester_colin$ all at once i remembered it myself when i looked at my hand digging with the trowel and i had to stand up on my feet to see if it was real
$mary_lennox$ looked hard too but she said nothing and it is real i well i well aye that th art said $dickon$
he had known it before in a way he had hoped it and felt it and thought about it but just at that minute something had rushed all through him a sort of rapturous belief and realization
i well i well said $mester_colin$ again and his face went quite red all over and it had been so strong that he could not help calling out
i shall live forever and ever and ever he cried grandly i shall find out thousands and thousands of #thing#
i shall find out about people and creatures and everything that grows like $dickon$ and i shall never stop making $magic$ i well
i well i feel i feel as if i want to shout out something something thankful joyful $ben_weatherstaff$ who had been working near a rose bush glanced round at him
#tha# might sing th doxology he suggested in his dryest grunt he had no opinion of the doxology and he did not make the suggestion with any particular reverence
but $mester_colin$ was of an exploring mind and he knew nothing about the doxology what is that he inquired
$dickon$ can sing it for thee i ll warrant replied $ben_weatherstaff$ $dickon$ answered with his all perceiving animal charmer smile they sing it i church he said
mother says she believes th skylarks sings it when they gets up i th mornin if she says that it must be a nice song $mester_colin$ answered
i ve never been in a church myself i was always too ill sing it $dickon$ i want to hear it
$dickon$ was quite simple and unaffected about it he understood what $mester_colin$ felt better than $mester_colin$ did himself he understood by a sort of instinct so natural that he did not know it was understanding
he pulled off his cap and looked round still smiling #tha# must take off #tha# cap he said to $mester_colin$ an so mun #tha#
$ben_weatherstaff$ an #tha# mun stand up #tha# knows $mester_colin$ took off his cap and the sun shone on and warmed his thick hair as he watched $dickon$ intently
$ben_weatherstaff$ scrambled up from his knees and bared his head too with a sort of puzzled half resentful look on his old face as if he didnt know exactly why he was doing this remarkable #thing#
$dickon$ stood out among the trees and rose bushes and began to sing in quite a simple matter of fact way and in a nice strong boy voice
praise god from whom all blessings flow praise him all creatures here below praise him above ye heavenly host praise father son and holy ghost
when he had finished $ben_weatherstaff$ was standing quite still with his jaws set obstinately but with a disturbed look in his #eye# fixed on $mester_colin$
amen $mester_colin$ face was thoughtful and appreciative it is a very nice song he said i like it
perhaps it means just what i mean when i want to shout out that i am thankful to the $magic$
he stopped and thought in a puzzled way perhaps they are both the same #thing# how can we know the exact names of everything
sing it again $dickon$ let us try $mary_lennox$ i want to sing it too it my song how does it begin
and they sang it again and $mary_lennox$ and $mester_colin$ lifted their voices as musically as they could and $dickon$ swelled quite loud and beautiful and at the second line $ben_weatherstaff$ raspingly cleared his throat and at the third line he joined in with such vigor that it seemed almost savage and when the amen came to an end $mary_lennox$ observed that the very same #thing# had happened to him which had happened when he found out that $mester_colin$ was not a cripple his chin was twitching and he was staring and winking and his leathery old cheeks were wet
praise god from whom all blessings flow i never seed no sense in th doxology afore he said hoarsely but i may change my mind i time
i should say #tha# gone up five pound this week $mester_colin$ five on em $mester_colin$ was looking across the #garden# at something attracting his attention and his #expression# had become a startled #one#
who is coming in here he said quickly who is it the door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open and a woman had entered
she had come in with the last line of their song and she had stood still listening and looking at them
with the ivy behind her the sunlight drifting through the trees and dappling her long blue cloak and her nice fresh face smiling across the greenery she was rather like a softly colored illustration in #one# of $mester_colin$ books
she had wonderful affectionate #eye# which seemed to take everything in all of them even $ben_weatherstaff$ and the creatures and every flower that was in bloom
unexpectedly as she had appeared not #one# of them felt that she was an intruder at all $dickon$ #eye# lighted like lamps
it mother that who it is he cried and went across the grass at a run $mester_colin$ began to move toward her too and $mary_lennox$ went with him
they both felt their pulses beat faster it mother $dickon$ said again when they met halfway i knowed #tha# wanted to see her an i told her where th door was hid
$mester_colin$ held out his hand with a sort of flushed royal shyness but his #eye# quite devoured her face even when i was ill
i wanted to see you he said you and $dickon$ and the secret #garden# i never wanted to see any #one# or anything before
the sight of his uplifted face brought about a sudden change in her own she flushed and the corners of her mouth shook and a mist seemed to sweep over her #eye#
eh dear lad she broke out tremulously eh dear lad as if she had not known she were going to say it
she might have said it to $dickon$ in the same way if she had seen something in his face which touched her
she did not say $mester_colin$ but just dear lad quite suddenly $mester_colin$ liked it are you surprised because i am so well
he asked she put her hand on his shoulder and smiled the mist out of her #eye# aye that i am
she said but #tha# rt so like thy mother #tha# made my heart jump do you think said $mester_colin$ a little awkwardly that will make my father like me
aye for sure dear lad she answered and she gave his shoulder a soft quick pat he mun come home he mun come home
$susan_sowerby$ said $ben_weatherstaff$ getting close to her look at th lad legs wilt #tha# they was like drumsticks
i stockin two month ago an i heard folk tell as they was bandy an knock kneed both at th same time
look at em now $susan_sowerby$ laughed a comfortable laugh they re goin to be fine strong lad legs in a bit she said
let him go on playin an workin in the #garden# an eatin hearty an drinkin plenty good sweet milk
an there ll not be a finer pair i $yorkshire$ thank god for it she put both hands on mistress $mary_lennox$ shoulders and looked her little face over in a motherly fashion
an thee too she said #tha# rt grown near as hearty as our lisabeth ellen i ll warrant #tha# rt like thy mother too
our $martha$ told me as $mrs_medlock$ heard she was a pretty woman #tha# lt be like a blush rose when #tha# grows up my little lass bless thee
she did not mention that when $martha$ came home on her #day# out and described the plain sallow child she had said that she had no confidence
it doesnt stand to reason that a pretty woman could be th mother such a fou little lass she had added obstinately
whatever in what $mrs_medlock$ had heard $mary_lennox$ had not had time to pay much attention to her changing face
she had only known that she looked different and seemed to have a great deal more hair and that it was growing very fast
but remembering her pleasure in looking at the mem sahib in the past she was glad to hear that she might some #day# look like her
$susan_sowerby$ went round their #garden# with them and was told the whole story of it and shown every bush and tree which had come alive
each of them kept looking up at her comfortable rosy face secretly curious about the delightful feeling she gave them a sort of warm supported feeling
$mester_colin$ walked on #one# side of her and $mary_lennox$ on the other it seemed as if she understood them as $dickon$ understood his creatures
she stooped over the flowers and talked about them as if they were children soot followed her and once or twice cawed at her and flew upon her shoulder as if it were $dickon$
when they told her about the robin and the first flight of the young #one# she laughed a motherly little mellow laugh in her throat
i suppose learnin em to fly is like learnin children to walk but i feared i should be all in a worrit if mine had wings instead legs she said
it was because she seemed such a wonderful woman in her nice moorland cottage way that at last she was told about the $magic$
do you believe in $magic$ asked $mester_colin$ after he had explained about indian fakirs i do hope you do
that i do lad she answered i never knowed it by that name but what does th name matter
th same #thing# as set th seeds swellin an th sun shinin made thee a well lad an it th good #thing#
i warrant they call it a different name i france an a different #one# i germany it isnt like us poor fools as think it matters if us is called out of our names
th big good #thing# doesnt stop to worrit bless thee it goes on makin #world# by th million #world# like us
never thee stop believin in th big good #thing# an knowin th #world# full of it an call it what #tha# likes
#tha# wert singin to it when i come into th #garden# i felt so joyful said $mester_colin$ opening his beautiful strange #eye# at her
suddenly i felt how different i was how strong my arms and legs were you know and how i could dig and stand and i jumped up and wanted to shout out something to anything that would listen
th $magic$ listened when #tha# sung th doxology it would ha listened to anything #tha# sung it was th joy that mattered
she had packed a basket which held a regular feast this morning and when the hungry hour came and $dickon$ brought it out from its hiding place she sat down with them under their tree and watched them devour their food laughing and quite gloating over their appetites
eh lad lad what names to th joy maker and she gave his shoulders a quick soft pat again she was full of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd #thing#
she laughed as if she could not help it when they told her of the increasing difficulty there was in pretending that $mester_colin$ was still a fretful invalid
she told them stories in broad $yorkshire$ and taught them new words you see we cant help laughing nearly all the time when we are together explained $mester_colin$
and it doesnt #sound# ill at all we try to choke it back but it will burst out and that #sound# worse than ever
there #one# #thing# that comes into my mind so often said $mary_lennox$ and i can scarcely ever hold in when i think of it suddenly
it isnt like #one# yet but he gets a tiny bit fatter every #day# and suppose some morning it should look like #one# what should we do
i keep thinking suppose $mester_colin$ face should get to look like a full moon bless us all i can see #tha# has a good bit play actin to do said $susan_sowerby$
but #tha# wont have to keep it up much longer $mester_colin$ $mr_archibald_craven$ ll come home do you think he will asked $mester_colin$
why $susan_sowerby$ chuckled softly i suppose it ud nigh break thy heart if he found out before #tha# told him in #tha# own way she said
#tha# laid awake nights plannin it i couldnt bear any #one# else to tell him said $mester_colin$ i think about different ways every #day# i think now i just want to run into his room
that be a fine start for him said $susan_sowerby$ i like to see his face lad i would that
he mun come back that he mun #one# of the #thing# they talked of was the visit they were to make to her cottage
they planned it all they were to drive over the moor and lunch out of doors among the heather they would see all the twelve children and $dickon$ #garden# and would not come back until they were tired
$susan_sowerby$ got up at last to return to the house and $mrs_medlock$ it was time for $mester_colin$ to be wheeled back also
but before he got into his chair he stood quite close to $susan_sowerby$ and fixed his #eye# on her with a kind of bewildered adoration
and he suddenly caught hold of the fold of her blue cloak and held it fast you are just what i what i wanted he said
all at once $susan_sowerby$ bent down and drew him with her warm arms close against the bosom under the blue cloak as if he had been $dickon$ brother
i wish you were my mother as well as $dickon$ the quick mist swept over her #eye# eh dear lad
she said thy own mother in this ere very #garden# i do believe she couldna keep out of it
thy father mun come back to thee he mun #chapter# xxvii in the #garden# in each century since the beginning of the #world# wonderful #thing# have been discovered
in the last century more amazing #thing# were found out than in any century before in this new century hundreds of #thing# still more astounding will be brought to light
at first people refuse to believe that a strange new #thing# can be done then they begin to hope it can be done then they see it can be done then it is done and all the #world# wonders why it was not done centuries ago
#one# of the new #thing# people began to find out in the last century was that thoughts just mere thoughts are as powerful as electric batteries as good for #one# as sunlight is or as bad for #one# as poison
to let a sad thought or a bad #one# get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever germ get into your body
if you let it stay there after it has got in you may never get over it as long as you live
so long as mistress $mary_lennox$ mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about her dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to be pleased by or interested in anything she was a yellow faced sickly bored and wretched child
circumstances however were very kind to her though she was not at all aware of it they began to push her about for her own good
when her mind gradually filled itself with robins and moorland cottages crowded with children with queer crabbed old gardeners and common little $yorkshire$ housemaids with springtime and with secret #garden# coming alive #day# by #day# and also with a moor boy and his creatures there was no room left for the disagreeable thoughts which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellow and tired
so long as $mester_colin$ shut himself up in his room and thought only of his fears and weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him and reflected hourly on humps and early death he was a hysterical half crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and the spring and also did not know that he could get well and could stand upon his feet if he tried to do it
when new beautiful thoughts began to push out the old hideous #one# life began to come back to him his blood ran healthily through his veins and strength poured into him like a flood
much more surprising #thing# can happen to any #one# who when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his mind just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous #one#
his scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and there was nothing weird about it at all two #thing# cannot be in #one# place
while the secret #garden# was coming alive and two children were coming alive with it there was a man wandering about certain far away beautiful places in the norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains of switzerland
where you tend a rose my lad a thistle cannot grow and he was a man who for ten years had kept his mind filled with dark and heart broken thinking
he had not been courageous he had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of the dark #one#
he had wandered by blue lakes and thought them he had lain on mountain sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about him and flower breaths filling all the air
a terrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and he had let his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately to allow any rift of light to pierce through
when he traveled about darkness so brooded over him that the sight of him was a wrong done to other people because it was as if he poisoned the air about him with gloom
and he had thought them he had forgotten and deserted his home and his duties most strangers thought he must be either half mad or a man with some hidden crime on his soul
he was a tall man with a drawn face and crooked shoulders and the name he always entered on hotel registers was $mr_archibald_craven$ misselthwaite manor $yorkshire$ england
he had traveled far and wide since the #day# he saw mistress $mary_lennox$ in his study and told her she might have her bit of earth
he had been in the most beautiful places in europe though he had remained nowhere more than a few #day#
he had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and had looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them with such light as made it seem as if the #world# were just being born
but the light had never seemed to touch himself until #one# #day# when he realized that for the first time in ten years a strange #thing# had happened
he was in a wonderful valley in the austrian tyrol and he had been walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted any man soul out of shadow
but at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down to rest on a carpet of moss by a stream
he had chosen the quietest and remotest spots he had walked a long way and it had not lifted his it was a clear little stream which ran quite merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious damp greenness
sometimes it made a #sound# rather like very low laughter as it bubbled over and round stones he saw birds come and dip their heads to drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away
it seemed like a #thing# alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper the valley was very very still
as he sat gazing into the clear running of the water $mr_archibald_craven$ gradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet as quiet as the valley itself
he wondered if he were going to sleep but he was not he sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his #eye# began to see #thing# growing at its edge
there was #one# lovely mass of blue forget me nots growing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he found himself looking as he remembered he had looked at such #thing# years ago
he did not know that just that simple thought was slowly filling his mind filling and filling it until other #thing# were softly pushed aside
it was as if a sweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen and risen until at last it swept the dark water away
he was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were but of #course# he did not think of this himself
he only knew that the valley seemed to grow quieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright delicate blueness
he did not know how long he sat there or what was happening to him but at last he moved as if he were awakening and he got up slowly and stood on the moss carpet drawing a long deep soft breath and wondering at himself
something seemed to have been unbound and released in him very quietly what is it he said almost in a whisper and he passed his hand over his forehead
i do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered #thing# to be able to explain how this had happened to him
he did not understand at all himself but he remembered this strange hour months afterward when he was at misselthwaite again and he found out quite by accident that on this very #day# $mester_colin$ had cried out as he went into the secret #garden# i am going to live forever and ever and ever
the singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and he slept a new reposeful sleep but it was not with him very long
i almost feel as if i were alive neither does any #one# else yet he did not know that it could be kept
by the next night he had opened the doors wide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing back
he left the valley and went on his wandering way again but strange as it seemed to him there were minutes sometimes half hours when without his knowing
why the black burden seemed to lift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead #one#
slowly slowly for no reason that he knew of he was coming alive with the #garden# as the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he went to the lake of como
he spent his #day# upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back into the soft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he was tired so that he might sleep
but by this time he had begun to sleep better he knew and his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him
it was growing stronger but because of the rare peaceful hours when his thoughts were changed his soul was slowly growing stronger too
there he found the loveliness of a dream perhaps he thought my body is growing stronger he began to think of misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home
now and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what he should feel when he went and stood by the carved four posted bed again and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory white face while it slept and the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close shut #eye#
#one# marvel of a #day# he had walked so far that when he returned the moon was high and full and all the #world# was purple shadow and silver
the stillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not go into the villa he lived in
he walked down to a little bowered terrace at the water edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the heavenly scents of the night
he shrank from it he felt the strange calmness stealing over him and it grew deeper and deeper until he fell asleep
he did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream his dream was so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming
he thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of the late roses and listened to the lapping of the water at his feet he heard a voice calling
he remembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he had thought he was it was sweet and clear and happy and far away
it seemed very far but he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his very side archie
archie archie it said and then again sweeter and clearer than before archie archie he thought he sprang to his feet not even startled
it was such a real voice and it seemed so natural that he should hear it lilias lilias he answered
lilias where are you in the #garden# it came back like a #sound# from a golden flute in the #garden#
and then the dream ended but he did not awaken he slept soundly and sweetly all through the lovely night
he was an italian servant and was accustomed as all the servants of the villa were to accepting without question any strange #thing# his foreign master might do
no #one# ever knew when he would go out or come in or where he would choose to sleep or if he would roam about the #garden# or lie in the boat on the lake all night
when he did awake at last it was brilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him the man held a salver with some letters on it and he waited quietly until $mr_archibald_craven$ took them
when he had gone away $mr_archibald_craven$ sat a few moments holding them in his hand and looking at the lake
his strange calm was still upon him and something more a lightness as if the cruel #thing# which had been done had not happened as he thought as if something had changed
he was remembering the dream the real real dream in the #garden# he said wondering at himself in the #garden# but the door is locked and the key is buried deep
when he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he saw that the #one# lying at the top of the rest was an english letter and came from $yorkshire$
it was directed in a plain woman hand but it was not a hand he knew he opened it scarcely thinking of the writer but the first words attracted his attention at once
dear sir i am $susan_sowerby$ that made bold to speak to you once on the moor it was about miss $mary_lennox$ i spoke
i think you would be glad to come and if you will excuse me sir i think your lady would ask you to come if she was here
i will make bold to speak again please sir i would come home if i was you your obedient servant $susan_sowerby$
$mr_archibald_craven$ read the letter twice before he put it back in its envelope he kept thinking about the dream
i will go back to misselthwaite he said yes i ll go at once and he went through the #garden# to the villa and ordered pitcher to prepare for his return to england
in a few #day# he was in $yorkshire$ again and on his long railroad journey he found himself thinking of his boy as he had never thought in all the ten years past
during those years he had only wished to forget him now though he did not intend to think about him memories of him constantly drifted into his mind
he remembered the black #day# when he had raved like a madman because the child was alive and the mother was dead
he had refused to see it and when he had gone to look at it at last it had been such a weak wretched #thing# that everyone had been sure it would die in a few #day#
but to the surprise of those who took care of it the #day# passed and it lived and then everyone believed it would be a deformed and crippled creature
he had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries but he had shrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his own misery
the first time after a year absence he returned to misselthwaite and the small miserable looking #thing# languidly and indifferently lifted to his face the great gray #eye# with black lashes round them
so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy #eye# he had adored he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as death
after that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep and all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid with a vicious hysterical half insane temper
he had not meant to be a bad father but he had not felt like a father at all he could only be kept from furies dangerous to himself by being given his own way in every detail
all this was not an uplifting #thing# to recall but as the train whirled him through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was coming alive began to think in a new way and he thought long and steadily and deeply
perhaps i have been all wrong for ten years he said to himself ten years is a long time
it may be too late to do anything quite too late what have i been thinking of of #course# this was the wrong $magic$ to begin by saying too late
even $mester_colin$ could have told him that but he knew nothing of $magic$ either black or white this he had yet to learn
he wondered if $susan_sowerby$ had taken courage and written to him only because the motherly creature had realized that the boy was much worse was fatally ill
if he had not been under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken possession of him he would have been more wretched than ever
but the calm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it instead of giving way to thoughts of the worst he actually found he was trying to believe in better #thing#
could it be possible that she sees that i may be able to do him good and control him
but when on his way across the moor he stopped the #carriage# at the cottage seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in a group and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him that their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in the morning to help a woman who had a new #baby#
our $dickon$ they volunteered was over at the manor working in #one# of the #garden# where he went several #day# each week
$mr_archibald_craven$ looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round red cheeked faces each #one# grinning in its own particular way and he awoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot
he smiled at their friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket and gave it to our lizabeth ellen who was the oldest
he thought i will go and see her on my way to misselthwaite if you divide that into eight parts there will be half a crown for each of you he said
then amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he drove away leaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps of joy behind
why did it seem to give him a sense of homecoming which he had been sure he could never feel again that sense of the beauty of land and sky and purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing nearer to the great old house which had held those of his blood for six hundred years
how he had driven away from it the last time shuddering to think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four posted bed with the brocaded hangings
was it possible that perhaps he might find him changed a little for the better and that he might overcome his shrinking from him
the drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing #thing# how real that dream had been how wonderful and clear the voice which called back to him in the #garden#
in the #garden# i will try to find the key he said i will try to open the door i must though i dont know why
when he arrived at the manor the servants who received him with the usual ceremony noticed that he looked better and that he did not go to the remote rooms where he usually lived attended by pitcher
he went into the library and sent for $mrs_medlock$ she came to him somewhat excited and curious and flustered
how is master $mester_colin$ $mrs_medlock$ he inquired well sir $mrs_medlock$ answered he he different in a manner of speaking
well you see sir she tried to explain neither dr $mr_archibald_craven$ nor the nurse nor me can exactly make him out
worse he suggested $mrs_medlock$ really was flushed why is that to tell the truth sir master $mester_colin$ might be better and he might be changing for the worse
his appetite sir is past understanding and his ways has he become more more peculiar her master asked knitting his brows anxiously
he used to eat nothing and then suddenly he began to eat something enormous and then he stopped again all at once and the meals were sent back just as they used to be
that it sir he growing very peculiar when you compare him with what he used to be you never knew sir perhaps that out of doors he never would let himself be taken
the #thing# we ve gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leave a body trembling like a leaf
well sir just without warning not long after #one# of his worst tantrums he suddenly insisted on being taken out every #day# by miss $mary_lennox$ and $susan_sowerby$ boy $dickon$ that could push his chair
he took a fancy to both miss $mary_lennox$ and $dickon$ and $dickon$ brought his tame animals and if you ll credit it sir out of doors he will stay from morning until night
he throw himself into such a state that dr $mr_archibald_craven$ said he couldnt be responsible for forcing him how does he look
if he took his food natural sir you think he was putting on flesh but we re afraid it may be a sort of bloat
was the next question he laughs sometimes in a queer way when he alone with miss $mary_lennox$ he never used to laugh at all
dr $mr_archibald_craven$ is coming to see you at once if you ll allow him he never was as puzzled in his life
where is master $mester_colin$ now $mr_archibald_craven$ asked in the #garden# sir he always in the #garden# though not a human creature is allowed to go near for fear they ll look at him
in the #garden# he said and after he had sent $mrs_medlock$ away he stood and repeated it again and again
he had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he was standing in and when he felt he was on earth again he turned and went out of the room
he took his way as $mary_lennox$ had done through the door in the shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds
$mr_archibald_craven$ scarcely heard her last words in the #garden# the fountain was playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn flowers
he crossed the lawn and turned into the long walk by the ivied walls he did not walk quickly but slowly and his #eye# were on the path
he felt as if he were being drawn back to the place he had so long forsaken and he did not know why
he knew where the door was even though the ivy hung thick over it but he did not know exactly where it lay that buried key
so he stopped and stood still looking about him and almost the moment after he had paused he started and listened asking himself if he were walking in a dream
the ivy hung thick over the door the key was buried under the shrubs no human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years and yet inside the #garden# there were #sound#
they were the #sound# of running scuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees they were strange #sound# of lowered suppressed voices exclamations and smothered joyous cries
it seemed actually like the laughter of young #thing# the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not to be heard but who in a moment or so as their excitement mounted would burst forth
as he drew near to it his step became still more slow what in heaven name was he dreaming of what in heaven name did he hear
was he losing his reason and thinking he heard #thing# which were not for human ears was it that the far clear voice had meant
the feet ran faster and faster they were nearing the #garden# door there was quick strong young breathing and a wild outbreak of laughing shows which could not be contained and the door in the wall was flung wide open the sheet of ivy swinging back and a boy burst through it at full speed and without seeing the outsider dashed almost into his arms
$mr_archibald_craven$ had extended them just in time to save him from falling as a result of his unseeing dash against him and when he held him away to look at him in amazement at his being there he truly gasped for breath
and then the moment came the uncontrollable moment when the #sound# forgot to hush themselves he was a tall boy and a handsome #one#
he threw the thick hair back from his forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray #eye# eyes full of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe
he was glowing with life and his running had sent splendid #color# leaping to his face it was the #eye# which made $mr_archibald_craven$ gasp for breath
who what who he stammered this was not what $mester_colin$ had expected this was not what he had planned he had never thought of such a meeting
$mary_lennox$ who had been running with him and had dashed through the door too believed that he managed to make himself look taller than he had ever looked before inches taller
and yet to come dashing out winning a race perhaps it was even better he drew himself up to his very tallest
father he said i $mester_colin$ you cant believe it i scarcely can myself i $mester_colin$ like $mrs_medlock$ he did not understand what his father meant when he said hurriedly
in the #garden# in the #garden# yes hurried on $mester_colin$ it was the #garden# that did it and $mary_lennox$ and $dickon$ and the creatures and the $magic$
no #one# knows we kept it to tell you when you came i well i can beat $mary_lennox$ in a race
he said it all so like a healthy boy his face flushed his words tumbling over each other in his eagerness that $mr_archibald_craven$ soul shook with unbelieving joy
i going to be an athlete $mester_colin$ put out his hand and laid it on his father arm arent you glad father he ended
arent you glad i going to live forever and ever and ever $mr_archibald_craven$ put his hands on both the boy shoulders and held him still
he knew he dared not even try to speak for a moment take me into the #garden# my boy he said at last
the place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue and flaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies standing together lilies which were white or white and ruby
he remembered well when the first of them had been planted that just at this season of the year their late glories should reveal themselves
late roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine deepening the hue of the yellowing trees made #one# feel that #one# stood in an embowered temple of gold
and tell me all about it and so they led him in the newcomer stood silent just as the children had done when they came into its grayness
he looked round and round i thought it would be dead he said $mary_lennox$ thought so at first said $mester_colin$
but it came alive then they sat down under their tree all but $mester_colin$ who wanted to stand while he told the story
it was the strangest #thing# he had ever heard $mr_archibald_craven$ thought as it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion
mystery and $magic$ and wild creatures the weird midnight meeting the coming of the spring the passion of insulted pride which had dragged the young $rajah$ to his feet to defy old $ben_weatherstaff$ to his face
the listener laughed until tears came into his #eye# and sometimes tears came into his #eye# when he was not laughing
the odd companionship the play acting the great secret so carefully kept the athlete the lecturer the scientific discoverer was a laughable lovable healthy young human #thing#
i dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they see me but i am never going to get into the chair again
now he said at the end of the story it need not be a secret any more i shall walk back with you father to the house
$ben_weatherstaff$ duties rarely took him away from the #garden# but on this occasion he made an excuse to carry some vegetables to the kitchen and being invited into the servants hall by $mrs_medlock$ to drink a glass of beer
he was on the spot as he had hoped to be when the most dramatic event misselthwaite manor had seen during the present generation actually took place
$mrs_medlock$ knowing $ben_weatherstaff$ had come from the #garden# hoped that he might have caught sight of his master and even by chance of his meeting with master $mester_colin$
#one# of the windows looking upon the courtyard gave also a glimpse of the lawn did you see either of them $ben_weatherstaff$
she asked $ben_weatherstaff$ took his beer mug from his mouth and wiped his lips with the back of his hand
aye that i did he answered with a shrewdly significant air both of them suggested $mrs_medlock$ both of em returned $ben_weatherstaff$
thank ye kindly ma am i could sup up another mug of it together said $mrs_medlock$ hastily overfilling his beer mug in her excitement
together ma am and $ben_weatherstaff$ gulped down half of his new mug at #one# gulp where was master $mester_colin$ how did he look
what did they say to each other i didna hear that said $ben_weatherstaff$ along only bein on th stepladder lookin over th wall
but i ll tell thee this there been #thing# goin on outside as you house people knows nowt about an what #tha# ll find out #tha# ll find out soon
and it was not two minutes before he swallowed the last of his beer and waved his mug solemnly toward the window which took in through the shrubbery a piece of the lawn
when $mrs_medlock$ looked she threw up her hands and gave a little shriek and every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across the servants hall and stood looking through the window with their #eye# almost starting out of their heads
look there he said if #tha# curious look what comin across th grass across the lawn came the master of misselthwaite and he looked as many of them had never seen him
and by his side with his head up in the air and his #eye# full of laughter walked as strongly and steadily as any boy in $yorkshire$ master $mester_colin$
