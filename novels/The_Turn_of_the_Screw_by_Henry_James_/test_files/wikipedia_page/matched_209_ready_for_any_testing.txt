the turn of the screw is an horror novella by henry james that first appeared in serial format in collier weekly magazine january april
classified as both gothic fiction and ghost story the novella focuses on governess who caring for two children at remote estate becomes convinced that the grounds are haunted
in the century following its publication the turn of the screw became cornerstone text of academics who subscribed to new criticism
in october it appeared in the two magics book published by macmillan in new york city and heinemann in london the novella has had differing interpretations often mutually exclusive
however others have argued that the brilliance of the novella results from its ability to create an intimate sense of confusion and suspense within the reader
the novella has been adapted numerous times in radio drama film stage and television including broadway play and the film the innocents
on christmas eve an unnamed narrator listens to douglas friend read manuscript written by former governess whom douglas claims to have known and who is now dead
the manuscript tells the story of how the young governess is hired by man who has become responsible for his young nephew and niece after the deaths of their parents
many critics have tried to determine the exact nature of the evil hinted at by the story he lives mainly in london but also has country house bly
he is uninterested in raising the children the boy miles is attending boarding school while his younger sister miss_flora is living in summer country house in essex
miles and miss_flora uncle the governess new employer gives her full charge of the children and explicitly states that she is not to bother him with communications of any sort
she is currently being cared for by mrs_grose the housekeeper the governess travels to her new employer country house and begins her duties
miles soon returns from school for the summer just after letter arrives from the headmaster stating that he has been expelled
she fears there is some horrible secret behind the expulsion but is too charmed by the adorable young boy to want to press the issue
soon thereafter around the grounds of the estate the governess begins to see the figures of man and woman whom she does not recognize
these figures come and go at will without ever being seen or challenged by other members of the household and they seem to the governess to be supernatural
miles never speaks of the matter and the governess is hesitant to raise the issue she learns from mrs_grose that the governess predecessor miss_jessel and another employee peter_quint had had sexual relationship
before their deaths jessel and peter_quint spent much of their time with miss_flora and miles and this fact has grim significance for the current governess when she becomes convinced that the two children are secretly aware of the ghosts presence
later without permission miss_flora leaves the house while miles is playing music for the governess the governess notices miss_flora absence and goes with mrs_grose in search of her
they find her in folly on the shore of the lake and the governess is convinced that miss_flora has been talking to the ghost of miss_jessel
when the governess finally confronts miss_flora the girl denies seeing miss_jessel but the governess forces the girl to say miss_jessel name
at the governess suggestion mrs_grose takes miss_flora away to her uncle leaving the governess with miles who that night at last talks to her about his expulsion the ghost of peter_quint appears to the governess at the window
that releases miss_jessel power over the girl however miss_flora demands never to see the governess again the governess shields miles who attempts to see the ghost
the governess tells miles he is no longer controlled by the ghost and then finds that miles has died in her arms and the ghost has gone
he preferred to create ghosts that were eerie extensions of everyday reality the strange and sinister embroidered on the very type of the normal and easy as he put it in the new york edition preface to his final ghost story
throughout his career james was attracted to the ghost story however he was not fond of literature stereotypical ghosts the jolly corner
with the turn of the screw many critics have wondered if the strange and sinister were only in the governess mind and not part of reality
the result has been longstanding critical dispute about the reality of the ghosts and the sanity of the governess beyond the dispute critics have closely examined james narrative technique for the story
the framing introduction and subsequent first person narrative by the governess have been studied by theorists of fiction interested in the power of fictional narratives to convince or even manipulate readers
the imagery of the turn of the screw is reminiscent of gothic fiction the emphasis on old and mysterious buildings throughout the novella reinforces this motif
james also relates the amount of light present in various scenes to the strength of the supernatural or ghostly forces apparently at work
the governess refers directly to the mysteries of udolpho and indirectly to jane eyre evoking comparison of the governess not only to the character of jane eyre but also to the character of bertha the madwoman confined in thornfield
oliver elton wrote in that there is doubt raised and kept hanging whether after all the two ghosts who can choose to which persons they will appear are fact or delusions of the young governess who tells the story
edmund wilson was another of the earlier proponents of the theory questioning the governess sanity positing sexual repression as cause for her experiences
then john silver pointed out hints in the story that the governess might have gained previous knowledge of peter_quint appearance in non supernatural ways
this induced wilson to return to his original opinion that the governess was delusional and that the ghosts existed only in her imagination
wilson eventually recanted his opinion after considering the governess point by point description of peter_quint william veeder sees miles eventual death as induced by the governess
in complex psychoanalytic reading veeder concludes that the governess expressed her repressed rage toward her father and toward the master of bly on miles
other critics however have strongly defended the governess for example owen wingrave includes ghost that causes its title character sudden death although no one actually sees it
there are indications that the story james was told was about an incident in hinton ampner where in woman named mary ricketts moved from her home after seeing the apparitions of man and woman day and night staring through the windows bending over the beds and making her feel her children were in danger
all such attempts to olve the book however admiringly tendered unwittingly work toward its diminution profoundest pleasure lies in the beautifully fussed over way in which james refuses to come down on either side
in commentary in the new yorker brad leithauser has given his own perspective on the different interpretations of james novella the book becomes modest monument to the bold pursuit of ambiguity
according to leithauser the reader is meant to entertain both the proposition that the governess is mad and the proposition that the ghosts really do exist and consider the dreadful implications of each
poet and literary critic craig raine in his essay sex in nineteenth century literature states quite categorically his belief that victorian readers would have identified the two ghosts as child molesters
the turn of the screw was first published in the magazine collier weekly serialised in instalments january april the title illustration by john la farge depicts the governess with her arm around miles
the next night by the corner of the hearth in the best chair douglas began to read he did stand there but high up beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower
holding my candle high till came within sight of the tall window he presently produced something that made me drop straight down on the stone slab i must have thrown myself on my face on the ground
