at the same moment with roar which seemed to shake the very heavens the whole castle and the rock and even the hill on which it stood seemed to rise into the air and scatter in fragments while mighty cloud of black and yellow smoke volume on volume in rolling grandeur was shot upwards with inconceivable rapidity
then there was stillness in nature as the echoes of that thunderous report seemed to come as with the hollow boom of thunder clap the long reverberating roll which seems as though the floors of heaven shook
dr_john_seward and arthur_holmwood have each gotten married then down in mighty ruin falling whence they rose came the fragments that had been tossed skywards in the cataclysm
from where we stood it seemed as though the one fierce volcano burst had satisfied the need of nature and that the castle and the structure of the hill had sunk again into the void

between and stoker was business manager for the lyceum theatre in london where he supplemented his income by writing large number of sensational novels his most successful being the vampire tale count_dracula published on may
miss_lucy_westenra year old aristocrat viii_mina_murray best friend arthur_holmwood fianc√©e and count_dracula first victim part of it are set around the town of whitby where he spent summer holidays
throughout the and authors such as rider haggard rudyard kipling robert louis stevenson arthur_holmwood conan doyle and g wells wrote many tales in which fantastic creatures threatened the british empire
invasion literature was at peak and stoker formula was very familiar by to readers of fantastic adventure stories of an invasion of england by continental european influences
victorian readers enjoyed count_dracula as good adventure story like many other but it did not reach its legendary status until later in the century when film versions began to appear
shakespearean actor and friend of stoker sir henry irving was possible real life inspiration for the character of count_dracula the role was tailor made to his dramatic presence gentlemanly mannerisms and affinity for playing villain roles
before writing count_dracula stoker spent seven years researching european folklore and stories of vampires being most influenced by emily gerard essay transylvania superstitions which includes content about vampire myth
some historians are convinced that historic figure vlad iii count_dracula often called vlad the impaler was the model for stoker count although there is no supporting evidence
stoker borrowed only scraps of miscellaneous information according to one expert about this bloodthirsty tyrant of wallachia and there are no comments about him in stoker working notes
count_dracula scholar elizabeth miller has remarked that aside from the name and some mention of romanian history the background of stoker count bears no resemblance to that of vlad iii count_dracula
irving however never agreed to play the part on stage from to stoker was member of the london library where markings in sabine baring gould s
book of were wolf thomas browne pseudodoxica epidemica af crosse round about the carpathians and charles boner transylvania are attributed to stoker research for count_dracula
later he also claimed that he had nightmare caused by eating too much crab meat about vampire king rising from his grave
although it is widely known vampire novel count_dracula was not the first johann wolfgang von goethe published the bride of corinth in
from my grave to wander am forc still to seek the god long sever link still to love the bridegroom have lost and the life blood of his heart to drink lengthy penny dreadful serial from the mid victorian period by james malcolm rymer
dr_john_seward polidori created the image of vampire portrayed as an aristocratic man like the character of count_dracula in his tale the vampyre
he wrote vampyre during summer which he spent with frankenstein creator mary shelley her husband poet percy bysshe shelley and lord byron in
the lyceum theatre where stoker worked between and was headed by actor manager henry irving who was stoker real life inspiration for count_dracula mannerisms and who stoker hoped would play count_dracula in stage version
irving never did agree to do stage version but count_dracula dramatic sweeping gestures and gentlemanly mannerisms drew their living embodiment from irving
the dead un dead was one of stoker original titles for count_dracula and the manuscript was entitled simply the un dead up until few weeks before publication
stoker notes for count_dracula show that the name of the count was originally count wampyr but stoker became intrigued by the name count_dracula while doing research after reading william wilkinson book an account of the principalities of wallachia and moldavia with political observations relative to them london which he found in the whitby library and consulted number of time during visits to whitby in the
the name count_dracula was the patronym drƒÉculea of the descendants of vlad ii of wallachia who took the name dracul after being invested in the order of the dragon in
in the old romanian language the word dracul romanian drac dragon ul the meant the dragon and count_dracula meant son of the dragon
in the present day however dracul means the devil count_dracula was published in london in may by archibald constable and company
first american edition doubleday mcclure new york count_dracula was not an immediate bestseller when it was first published although reviewers were unstinting in their praise
the contemporary daily mail ranked stoker power above those of mary shelley and edgar allan poe as well as emily bront√´ wuthering heights
according to literary historians nina auerbach and david skal in the norton critical edition the novel has become more significant for modern readers than it was for victorian readers most of whom enjoyed it just as good adventure story
costing six shillings the novel was bound yellow cloth and titled in red letter it reached its broad and iconic status only later in the century when the movie versions appeared
a asbj√∏rn j√∏n has also noted that count_dracula has had significant impact on the image of the vampire in popular culture folklore and legend
in the last year of his life he was so poor that he had to petition for compassionate grant from the royal literary fund and his widow was forced to sell his notes and outlines of the novel at sotheby auction in where they were purchased for little over
it did not make much money for stoker but then w murnau unauthorized adaptation of the story was released in theatres in in the form of nosferatu
nosferatu was followed by highly successful stage adaptation touring the uk for three years before arriving in the us where stoker creation caught hollywood attention and after the american movie version was released the book has never been out of print
however some victorian fans were ahead of the time describing it as the sensation of the season and the most blood curdling novel of the paralysed century
sherlock holmes author sir arthur_holmwood conan doyle wrote to stoker in letter i write to tell you how very much have enjoyed reading count_dracula
stoker widow took affront and during the legal battle that followed the novel popularity started to grow i think it is the very best story of diablerie which have read for many years
in seeking parallel to this weird powerful and horrorful story our mind reverts to such tales as the mysteries of udolpho frankenstein the fall of the house of usher but count_dracula is even more appalling in its gloomy fascination than any one of these
the daily mail review of june proclaimed it classic of gothic horror similarly good reviews appeared when the book was published in the s in
in the last several decades literary and cultural scholars have offered diverse analyses of stoker novel and the character of count_dracula
the first american edition was published by doubleday mcclure in new york bentley reads count_dracula as an embodiment of the freudian
while christopher craft sees count_dracula as embodying latent homosexuality and sees the text as an example of characteristic if hyperbolic instance of victorian anxiety over the potential fluidity of gender roles
id and talia schaffer construes the novel as an indictment of oscar wilde though hollis robbins suggests that count_dracula inability to participate in social conventions and to forge business partnerships undermines his power
richard noll reads count_dracula within the context of century alienism psychiatry and asylum medicine bruno starrs understands the novel to be pro catholic pamphlet promoting proselytization
count_dracula is work of fiction but it does contain some historical references although it is matter of conjecture and debate as to how much historical connection was deliberate on stoker part
attention was drawn to the supposed connections between the historical transylvanian born vlad iii count_dracula also known as vlad tepes of wallachia and bram stoker fictional count_dracula following the publication of in search of count_dracula by radu florescu and raymond mcnally in
during his main reign vlad the impaler is said to have killed from to european civilians political rivals criminals and anyone that he considered useless to humanity mainly by impaling
vlad iii is revered as folk hero by romanians for driving off the invading ottoman turks of whom his impaled victims are said to have included as many as
the sources depicting these events are records by saxon settlers in neighbouring transylvania who had frequent clashes with vlad iii there is no solid evidence that the count in the novel was modelled on vlad the impaler of wallachia
at most stoker borrowed only the name count_dracula and scraps of miscellaneous information about romanian history according to one expert elizabeth miller as well and there are no comments about him in the author working notes
historically the name count_dracula is derived from chivalric order called the order of the dragon founded by sigismund of luxembourg then king of hungary to uphold christianity and defend the empire against the ottoman turks
vlad ii dracul father of vlad iii was admitted to the order around after which vlad ii wore the emblem of the order and later as ruler of wallachia his coinage bore the dragon symbol from which the name count_dracula is derived since dracul in romanian means the dragon
people of wallachia only knew voievod prince vlad iii as vlad »õepe»ô the impaler the name count_dracula became popular in romania after publication of stoker book
contrary to popular belief the name count_dracula does not translate to son of the devil in romanian which would be fiul diavolului
stoker came across the name count_dracula in his reading on romanian history and chose this to replace the name count wampyr originally intended for his villain
some count_dracula scholars led by elizabeth miller argue that stoker knew little of the historic vlad iii except for the name count_dracula in addition to few bits of romanian history
stoker mentions that his count_dracula fought against the turks and was later betrayed by his brother historical fact in the novel which point to vlad iii
who was it but one of my own race who as voivode crossed the danube and beat the turk on his own ground
woe was it that his own unworthy brother when he had fallen sold his people to the turk and brought the shame of slavery on them
was it not this count_dracula indeed who inspired that other of his race who in later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into turkey land who when he was beaten back came again and again though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph
the count identity is later speculated on by professor abraham_van_helsing he must indeed have been that voivode count_dracula who won his name against the turk over the great river on the very frontier of turkey land
many of stoker biographers and literary critics have found strong similarities to the earlier irish writer sheridan le fanu classic of the vampire genre carmilla
in writing count_dracula stoker may also have drawn on stories about the s√≠dhe some of which feature blood drinking woman the irish legend of abhartach has also been suggested as source
it is also thought probable that his mothers stories of events during the severe cholera outbreak in sligo in were influential
in mcnally additionally suggested that stoker was influenced by the history of hungarian countess elizabeth bathory who allegedly tortured and killed between and young woman
it was later commonly believed rumor that she committed these crimes to bathe in their blood believing that this preserved her youth
particularly themes of being buried while alive b√°thory castle was also located in the carpathian mountains just as count_dracula albeit in different region
in her book the essential count_dracula clare haword maden suggested that the castle of count_dracula was inspired by slains castle at which bram stoker was guest of the earl of erroll
according to miller he first visited cruden bay in three years after work had begun on count_dracula haining and tremaine maintain that during this visit stoker was especially impressed by slains castle interior and the surrounding landscape
possibly stoker was not inspired by real edifice at all but by jules verne novel the carpathian castle or anne radcliffe
third possibility is that he copied information about kem√©ny castle at v√©cs from one of his sources on transylvania the book by major c further option is that stoker saw an illustration of castle bran t√∂rzburg in the book on transylvania by charles boner or read about it in the book by mazuchelli or crosse
many of the scenes in whitby and london are based on real place that stoker frequently visited although he distorts the geography for the sake of the story in some case
one scholar has suggested that stoker chose whitby as the site of count_dracula first appearance in england because of the synod of whitby given the novel preoccupation with timekeeping and calendar disputes
daniel farson leonard wolf and peter haining have suggested that stoker received much historical information from √°rmin v√°mb√©ry hungarian professor whom he met at least twice
miller argues there is nothing to indicate that the conversation included vlad vampires or even transylvania and furthermore there is no record of any other correspondence between stoker and v√°mb√©ry nor is v√°mb√©ry mentioned in stoker notes for count_dracula
miller and leatherdale question the stringency of this connection the mysteries of udolpho cover of count_dracula guest and other weird stories collection of short stories authored by bram stoker
it was according to most contemporary critics the deleted first or second chapter from the original manuscript but which the original publishers deemed unnecessary to the overall story
the short story count_dracula guest was posthumously published in two years after stoker death count_dracula guest follows an unnamed englishman traveller as he wanders around munich before leaving for transylvania
it is walpurgis night and the young englishman foolishly leaves his hotel in spite of the coachman warnings and wanders through dense forest alone
the short story climaxes in an old graveyard where the englishman caught in blizzard takes refuge in the marble tomb of countess dolingen of gratz
along the way he feels that he is being watched by tall and thin stranger possibly count_dracula within the tomb he sees the countess apparently asleep and healthy
but before he can investigate further mysterious force throws him clear of the tomb a lightning bolt then strikes the tomb destroying it and incinerating the undead screaming countess
he awakens to find gigantic wolf lying on his chest and licking at his throat however the wolf merely keeps him warm and protects him until help arrives
when the englishman is finally taken back to his hotel telegram awaits him from his expectant host count_dracula with warning about dangers from snow and wolf and night
main article count_dracula the un dead in an official sequel was published written by bram stoker great grand nephew dacre stoker and ian holt
an interpretation of the missing pages of the original novel it was pieced together from bram stoker editorial notes artifacts and journals
dacre stoker and d barker will write prequel to count_dracula titled dracul further information count_dracula in popular culture bela lugosi as count_dracula in the film
the story of count_dracula has been the basis for numerous films and plays this adaption was first published only century later in october
the first motion picture to feature count_dracula was count_dracula death produced in hungary in the now lost film however was not an adaptation of stoker novel but featured an original story
f murnau unauthorised film adaptation nosferatu was released in and the popularity of the novel increased considerably owing to an attempt by stoker widow to have the film removed from public circulation
prana film the production company had been unable to obtain permission to adapt the story from bram widow florence stoker so screenwriter henrik galeen was told to alter numerous details to avoid legal trouble
galeen transplanted the action of the story from england to germany and reworked several characters dropping some such as miss_lucy_westenra and all three of her suitors and renaming other count_dracula became orlok jonathan_harker became thomas hutter viii_mina_murray became ellen and so on
this attempt failed to avoid court case however florence stoker sued prana film and all copies of the film were ordered to be destroyed
however the company was bankrupt and stoker only recovered her legal fees in damages some copies survived and found their way into theatres
subsequent rereleases of the film have typically undone some of the changes such as restoring the original character names a practice also followed by werner herzog in his remake of murnau film nosferatu the vampyre
florence stoker licensed the story to playwright hamilton deane whose stage play adaptation toured england for several years before settling down in london
eventually florence stoker gave up the fight against public displays of the film in american stage producer horace liveright hired dr_john_seward balderston to revise deane script in advance of its american premiere
the deane play and its balderston revisions introduced an expanded role and history for mr_renfield who now replaced jonathan_harker as count_dracula solicitor in the first part of the story combined viii_mina_murray jonathan_harker and miss_lucy_westenra into single character named miss_lucy_westenra and omitted both arthur_holmwood and mr_quincey_morris entirely
when the play premiered in new york it was with bela lugosi in the title role and with edward van sloan as abraham_van_helsing roles which both actors as well as herbert bunston as dr_john_seward reprised for the english language version of the universal studios film production
the film was one of the most commercially successful adaptations of the story to date it and the deane balderston play that preceded it set the standard for film and television adaptations of the story with the alterations to the novel becoming standard for later adaptations for decades to come
balderston significantly compressed the story most notably consolidating or removing several characters universal studios continued to feature the character of count_dracula in many of their horror films from the
in british film company hammer film productions followed the success of its the curse of frankenstein from the previous year with count_dracula released in the us as horror of count_dracula directed by terence fisher
and christopher lee as the title character in count_dracula fisher production featured christopher lee as count_dracula and peter cushing as abraham_van_helsing
both lee and cushing reprised their roles multiple time over the next decade and half concluding with the legend of the golden vampires with cushing but not lee in
christopher lee also took on the role of count_dracula in count_dracula spanish italian german coproduction notable for its adherence to the plot of the original novel
it was an international hit for hammer film and lee fixed the image of the fanged vampire in popular culture playing the part of mr_renfield in that version was klaus kinski who later played count_dracula himself in nosferatu the vampyre
later film adaptations include dr_john_seward badham count_dracula starring frank langella and inspired by the broadway revival of the deane hamilton play and francis ford coppola bram stoker count_dracula starring gary oldman
the character of count_dracula has remained popular over the years and many films have used the character as villain while other have named him in their titles including count_dracula daughter and the brides of count_dracula
in the bbc made count_dracula minute adaptation for television starring louis jourdan as of an estimated films feature count_dracula in major role number second only to sherlock holmes films
a large number of these appearances are not adaptations of stoker novel but merely feature the character in an unrelated story
